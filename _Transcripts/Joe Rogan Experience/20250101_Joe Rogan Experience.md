# Joe Rogan Experience #2250 - Raekwon
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6.0s)]
*  That's it, the chef is in the building, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=10.0s)]
*  What's up, what's up? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=16.0s)]
*  Pleasure to meet you, man. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=17.0s)]
*  You are a part of the most iconic band in all of hip hop. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=18.0s)]
*  There is no question. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=22.0s)]
*  There's one Wu Tang. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=23.0s)]
*  There's only one Wu Tang. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=25.0s)]
*  Nothing else is even close. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=26.0s)]
*  You guys are so different than every other band that ever existed. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=28.0s)]
*  It was a giant group of you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=32.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=34.0s)]
*  And everybody was a killer. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=35.0s)]
*  Fucking mob, man. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=36.0s)]
*  It's a crazy band, man. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=37.0s)]
*  Fucking mob. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=39.0s)]
*  No one is, if you think about it, there's been a lot of hip hop duos. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=40.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of producers and MCs. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=44.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of people that get together in like small groups. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=47.0s)]
*  But there's only one Wu Tang. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=50.0s)]
*  There's only one group of nine assassins. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=52.0s)]
*  I tell niggas that all the time. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=55.0s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=57.0s)]
*  You ain't going to get another one of these. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=58.0s)]
*  It's crazy that it worked. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=60.0s)]
*  Because it's so hard to keep all those alphas together. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=62.0s)]
*  It really is crazy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=65.0s)]
*  To make it work, the most illest shit, some shit that I never would have thought would ever exist, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=66.0s)]
*  it was able to exist because we tried it, but it wasn't normal. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=73.0s)]
*  It wasn't normal. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=79.0s)]
*  You tried it, but it almost seems like it was just instinct. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=80.0s)]
*  It's not like a business strategy that anybody would ever come up with. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=84.0s)]
*  Nine dudes and nine of the realest dudes, the rawest realest dudes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=90.0s)]
*  And it worked? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=97.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it worked. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=98.0s)]
*  And it worked? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=99.0s)]
*  I tell people all the time, it was like when RZA, he came with this whole philosophy of wanting to do it, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=100.0s)]
*  it was like hitting the lotto for him. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=105.0s)]
*  He didn't know what to expect. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=107.0s)]
*  It was more a reputation thing for us. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=109.0s)]
*  It was like, yo, I want to do this. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=112.0s)]
*  And he came to the block and he talked to some real dudes that really had other shit planned in their life. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=114.0s)]
*  But hip hop was always like that backpack that we wore every day. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=120.0s)]
*  But everybody had different plans. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=124.0s)]
*  So he really literally came in and started to pick motherfuckers that he felt had potential. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=126.0s)]
*  So it's like the mob. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=132.0s)]
*  It's like Lucky Luciano, prime example. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=133.0s)]
*  He knew that motherfuckers had potential. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=139.0s)]
*  He knew dudes had potential in any way. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=142.0s)]
*  He's from a different party, he's from a different party, he's from a different part. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=145.0s)]
*  But yo, what we could do right here is we could make money. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=148.0s)]
*  So put your fucking feelings down or whatever the case may be and let's talk about some money. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=152.0s)]
*  And that right there, kind of like, yo, you start shaking hands across the table. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=159.0s)]
*  I know you didn't really fuck with me like that, yo. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=164.0s)]
*  I never had anything against you like that, though. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=166.0s)]
*  But it was just something that he felt like at the end of the day. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=168.0s)]
*  Let me try this shit. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=172.0s)]
*  Well, RZA is a genius. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=174.0s)]
*  And it's amazing that he was able to coordinate that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=176.0s)]
*  Because that's often the case, right, with other killers. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=180.0s)]
*  Like when a dude's a bad motherfucker, they always assume that everybody else doesn't like them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=183.0s)]
*  They always assume that everybody else is the enemy or competition. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=188.0s)]
*  So to have nine of you guys together like that as one group, you know, we always, I told you when I sent you a message, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=193.0s)]
*  I said that we play Protect Your Neck. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=200.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=202.0s)]
*  Whenever we have a police escort, that's what's the most hilarious thing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=203.0s)]
*  So we do arena shows, we hire a police escort. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=206.0s)]
*  So it's like fucking sirens and shit, protect your neck. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=209.0s)]
*  It's like the perfect song to play when you're getting a police escort. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=212.0s)]
*  Oh my God, I know, trust me. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=217.0s)]
*  These young kids that I have at the club, like I was explaining Wu-Tang Clan to them the other night. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=220.0s)]
*  I go, do you have to understand how wild this band was? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=224.0s)]
*  I go, when Old Dirty Bastard was in Rikers, they went to Rikers and performed in Rikers. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=227.0s)]
*  You remember that? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=235.0s)]
*  Yes! [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=236.0s)]
*  How the fuck you remember that? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=237.0s)]
*  I told everybody, I was like, you know how crazy that is? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=238.0s)]
*  You're talking about like the biggest rap band in the fucking world. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=240.0s)]
*  And they're performing in a penitentiary to one of the members who's one of the biggest fucking hip hop stars in the world, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=245.0s)]
*  who's in jail, and then you guys go into the crowd. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=252.0s)]
*  God bless his soul, first and foremost. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=257.0s)]
*  Oh my God, Old Dirty Bastard was a classic. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=260.0s)]
*  Yo Joe is the funniest shit because when we came in and when we seen him, he was eating a cheeseburger laughing and shit. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=262.0s)]
*  He remind you, he never was dirty. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=268.0s)]
*  I never seen him eat meat like that or whatever the case may be, but we came in and he was eating a cheeseburger and shit laughing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=272.0s)]
*  So we was dying laughing. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=279.0s)]
*  And the people up in here, they kept telling us like, yo, y'all can't go into the crowd with everybody. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=281.0s)]
*  We not going to hold no responsibility if something happened. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=289.0s)]
*  So you know, we like, alright, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, we going in. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=293.0s)]
*  Once we got on that stage, it was like, fuck the stage. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=296.0s)]
*  We out there touching everybody. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=299.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=301.0s)]
*  It was love, man. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=302.0s)]
*  What year was that? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=303.0s)]
*  It was a lot of love. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=304.0s)]
*  Man, it had to be what? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=305.0s)]
*  I say what? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=306.0s)]
*  Ninety... what? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=307.0s)]
*  Ninety... 98, 97? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=309.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=312.0s)]
*  98? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=313.0s)]
*  No internet. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=314.0s)]
*  Probably like, yeah, none of that shit. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=315.0s)]
*  None of that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=316.0s)]
*  Is there even a recording of that anywhere? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=317.0s)]
*  Nah. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=320.0s)]
*  God. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=321.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=322.0s)]
*  You know how wild that video would be? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=323.0s)]
*  Yeah, I never knew that people seen that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=325.0s)]
*  I don't know how the fuck you knew that shit. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=327.0s)]
*  Oh, I heard about it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=329.0s)]
*  Yeah, I heard about it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=330.0s)]
*  But they loved that song. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=331.0s)]
*  It was in the news back then that you guys performed in Rikers. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=332.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=336.0s)]
*  Man, I was a wild bro. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=337.0s)]
*  The 90s for hip hop, it was like, people need... you have to understand, for young people, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=338.0s)]
*  you grew up with hip hop, you're only 20 years old, I get it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=344.0s)]
*  But you have to understand from my perspective, in 1980, there was no hip hop. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=347.0s)]
*  In 1992, that was all anybody gave a fuck about. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=353.0s)]
*  That is crazy for a new art form. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=356.0s)]
*  Until it emerged, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=360.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=362.0s)]
*  There was Sugarhill Gang, there was some hip hop, but it wasn't the thing until the 90s. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=363.0s)]
*  And 90s hip hop was... [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=369.0s)]
*  It got big. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=370.0s)]
*  It got big. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=371.0s)]
*  Oh, it got so big. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=372.0s)]
*  Because look, I remember, it's so crazy you said that because I tell people all the time, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=373.0s)]
*  Disco to me was hip hop before hip hop was. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=378.0s)]
*  Disco, R&B, everything was a mixture. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=383.0s)]
*  It was a mixture. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=387.0s)]
*  So really, when hip hop came, like you said, it came like, maybe I'm going to say 80s, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=389.0s)]
*  85? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=397.0s)]
*  It had to be 84 because I was in junior high school. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=398.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=402.0s)]
*  We was young boys, right? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=403.0s)]
*  I would definitely say you heard something and it was like, oh shit, motherfucker, this [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=404.0s)]
*  rhyming. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=410.0s)]
*  This shit sound cool though. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=411.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=413.0s)]
*  It sound cool. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=414.0s)]
*  But really, it was a way to bring people together that was going through different shit in their [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=415.0s)]
*  life. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=422.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=423.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=424.0s)]
*  You know why it was earlier than that? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=425.0s)]
*  Because in 84, I was in high school. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=426.0s)]
*  So it had to be 80. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=427.0s)]
*  80, 82. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=428.0s)]
*  Because I was a freshman in high school in 81. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=429.0s)]
*  So I heard Sugarhill Gang when I lived in Jamaica Plain, which was in 1980. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=431.0s)]
*  So that was the first time I'd ever heard any kind of hip hop. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=436.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=439.0s)]
*  So like, yeah, like we said, 80? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=440.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was 10 years old. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=442.0s)]
*  So me, probably really, really gravitating to it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=444.0s)]
*  I probably was like 12, like you said. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=448.0s)]
*  12, 42. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=450.0s)]
*  What was the first hip hop that really grabbed you? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=451.0s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=454.0s)]
*  Do you remember what was the shit that you were first into when you were a kid? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=455.0s)]
*  All right, folks, it's that time of year. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=458.0s)]
*  Everyone is on a mission to improve their health and wellness habits and set the tone [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=460.0s)]
*  for 2025 by sticking to a routine. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=464.0s)]
*  And while sticking to a healthy routine isn't always easy, it's so worth it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=467.0s)]
*  And you all know that I've been using AG1 for years. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=471.0s)]
*  It's honestly been so supportive of my foundational nutrition. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=474.0s)]

*  And many traditional supplements are poorly absorbed. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=485.0s)]
*  But AG1 is designed for maximum nutrient absorption and is packed with micronutrients that are hard to get in your everyday diet. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=487.0s)]
*  You can also add a few drops of their vitamin D3 plus K2 for added immune support. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=495.0s)]
*  It's a game changer, especially during the winter months. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=500.0s)]
*  So set the tone for a healthy year ahead with AG1. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=503.0s)]
*  Simply put, it's a way to invest in your health now and in the long run. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=506.0s)]
*  And that's why I partner with them for so long. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=511.0s)]

*  For me, a top priority is financial wellness, which feels more important than ever. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=539.0s)]
*  And that's where Rocket Money comes in. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=544.0s)]

*  But then that show gets canceled and you realize there's only so much vinegary goodness a person can take. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=579.0s)]
*  The money still leaves your account every month and you just never quite get around to canceling it because you're a busy person. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=585.0s)]

*  Like if they catch you at night they'll kill you. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=814.0s)]
*  Like they'd be dressed up like a fucking drag or whatever. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=816.0s)]
*  All this makeup on. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=820.0s)]
*  And you know I remember one time going to the incinerator room. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=821.0s)]
*  My mom made me go. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=825.0s)]
*  She made me go to the. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=826.0s)]
*  To the take out the garbage and shit. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=828.0s)]
*  I forgot to take it out. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=829.0s)]
*  And she came home later that day and I was laying down. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=831.0s)]
*  And she fucking smacked me in the head with a broom. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=834.0s)]
*  Like yo didn't I tell you to take out the fucking garbage. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=836.0s)]
*  So now I'm going out to the incinerator room. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=839.0s)]
*  You know walking. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=841.0s)]
*  It's on the same floor. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=842.0s)]
*  And I remember when I cut the corner. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=843.0s)]
*  I seen a motherfucker sticking his head out. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=846.0s)]
*  And he had his hair all wild. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=848.0s)]
*  His shit was like green and red and all this. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=850.0s)]
*  And he had lipstick on all crazy. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=852.0s)]
*  And his eyes was all fucking bugged out looking. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=854.0s)]
*  And he looked at me. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=857.0s)]
*  And I got the garbage pail with me. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=859.0s)]
*  And it's like yo once I seen him I just. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=861.0s)]
*  I just dropped the shit and ran. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=863.0s)]
*  Mom. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=865.0s)]
*  Mom. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=866.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=867.0s)]
*  Back then you know you yell your mother name and shit. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=868.0s)]
*  You think that that was something cool back then. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=870.0s)]
*  You know she's your hero at that time. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=872.0s)]
*  Came back. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=874.0s)]
*  That nigga was gone. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=875.0s)]
*  But I think if he would have caught me in that incinerator door. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=876.0s)]
*  When it was closed. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=879.0s)]
*  He was going to probably try to run in there. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=880.0s)]
*  And probably try to fucking kill me or something. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=882.0s)]
*  And that shit was going on back then. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=884.0s)]
*  Because the drugs. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=886.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=891.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=893.0s)]

*  And shooting it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=902.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=903.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=904.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=905.0s)]
*  It was a serious time back then man. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=906.0s)]
*  But you know that's how far to me music went back. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=908.0s)]
*  You know listening to ladies night. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=913.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=915.0s)]
*  I had people on my store. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=916.0s)]
*  I had a candy store. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=917.0s)]
*  Right on the same floor. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=918.0s)]
*  But it wasn't a candy store. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=920.0s)]
*  They had a bunch of penny candy just to make kids feel cool. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=921.0s)]
*  But really they were selling coke in the back. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=924.0s)]
*  Coke and dope though. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=926.0s)]
*  So you know all this was going on in the community man. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=927.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=930.0s)]
*  It was a serious time. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=931.0s)]
*  Scary times back then. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=932.0s)]
*  But if it's not for those scary times. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=934.0s)]
*  You don't get the kind of band that Wu Tang was. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=937.0s)]
*  Like that has to emerge from an authentic experience. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=940.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=943.0s)]
*  It has to. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=944.0s)]
*  And that's part of the appeal of it is that everybody kind of knew that. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=945.0s)]
*  You know it was part of the appeal. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=949.0s)]
*  There's never been like a genre of music like that that's so connected to like the grind and poverty and crime and ghettos. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=952.0s)]
*  Like the whole genre of to be authentic. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=961.0s)]
*  You had to come from that. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=964.0s)]
*  You couldn't be like some rich kid from the suburbs that was talking about some shit you never actually experienced. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=965.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to hear it. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=972.0s)]
*  Which is kind of crazy. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=974.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=975.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=976.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=977.0s)]
*  I mean you know back then you know hip hop was really an expression for the ghetto. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=978.0s)]
*  You know the way that out you know being that we was living in fucked up situations and nobody had shit. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=983.0s)]
*  Nobody had no fucking jobs like that. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=990.0s)]
*  It was like yo we needed something to keep us cool. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=993.0s)]
*  Keep us in the vibe mode. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=996.0s)]
*  You know back then gangs was still relevant. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=999.0s)]
*  You know we never looked at ourselves as a gang. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1002.0s)]
*  We might have looked at ourselves as a tribe that yo when you from a neighborhood and you stick to your neighborhood. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1006.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1012.0s)]
*  And that's why even back then it was like a lot of times you know you would beef with people that wasn't from your neighborhood just because you wasn't from here. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1013.0s)]
*  It's like yo what the fuck you doing over here. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1021.0s)]
*  You don't live over here. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1023.0s)]
*  You know then it creates this animosity thing. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1024.0s)]
*  And I remember for us you know being in an area where it was like you go up the block. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1027.0s)]
*  Up the block. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1033.0s)]
*  Stayed up the block. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1034.0s)]
*  Down the block. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1035.0s)]
*  Stayed down the block. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1036.0s)]
*  So for me I was in the middle. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1037.0s)]
*  So you know I leaned more towards up the block. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1039.0s)]
*  You know but then we would go down the block just to start trouble and you know then they would come up the block and they would start trouble. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1043.0s)]
*  And next thing you know before you know we all fucking with each other. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1051.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1055.0s)]
*  So that was our way of getting to know each other is to test each other's heart. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1056.0s)]
*  And whatever may happen was happening back then though. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1061.0s)]
*  But the music believe it or not the music was keeping a peace. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1065.0s)]
*  Now just you know the music was keeping a peace because they would do block parties right. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1069.0s)]
*  They would do block parties and you know everybody knew all these different DJs was coming from different places and going to play some music and shit. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1074.0s)]
*  So we knew every time they did that we knew something was going to happen at the end of the night. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1086.0s)]
*  It was just mandatory. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1091.0s)]
*  It was just because people from all over different neighborhoods would come out and everything would be nice. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1092.0s)]
*  And next thing you know you see a motherfucker riding down the street all crazy you know trying to hit motherfuckers and swinging the golf club out the window and shit. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1100.0s)]
*  And you know somebody mother might have gotten knocked out. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1111.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1114.0s)]
*  You know but the music is still playing. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1115.0s)]
*  You know so yeah that's the type of shit that to me that made it fun but made it spooky. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1120.0s)]
*  But it still was fun because it was something to remember. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1127.0s)]
*  It was like what's fun because you survived. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1130.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1131.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1132.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1133.0s)]
*  Yeah you know but we were young so we didn't we didn't care about we didn't care about whether we live or die at that time. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1134.0s)]
*  Give a fuck. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1141.0s)]
*  It was like whatever's going to happen is going to happen. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1142.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1144.0s)]
*  But the music the music is what kept things in order for us you know because we always felt like that was a vessel to being calm. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1145.0s)]
*  You know when you come from somewhere that's fucked up Joe and it's nothing near you can't get a job because of your community your zip code. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1155.0s)]
*  Don't allow you to be like Joey he's hired. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1163.0s)]
*  No it's just too infested over there. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1166.0s)]
*  So you kind of you kind of become relaxed with that mentality of saying well fuck it. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1168.0s)]
*  I'm a live off the land. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1173.0s)]
*  I'm a sell weed. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1175.0s)]
*  I'm going to do whatever I think that is going to make me survive. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1177.0s)]
*  You know so everything is just survival. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1184.0s)]
*  You know when music always kept us calm and you always want to listen to what's the next band played like I grew up on R&B music like disco and you know all that all that fun shit roller skating. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1186.0s)]
*  You know I knew motherfuckers in the neighborhood that was roller skating. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1202.0s)]
*  You know we would get off of Staten Island sometimes and go to these different parks and jams in the city. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1206.0s)]
*  That was fun too though. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1215.0s)]
*  That was that was fun times for us. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1217.0s)]
*  When was it so was it RZA that tried that was it initially all nine guys like how did it get formed. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1219.0s)]
*  Well number one it was RZA his cousin Jizza and his other cousin old dirty bastard that they were super close. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1228.0s)]
*  Now old dirty bastard and Jizza they were from Brooklyn. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1240.0s)]
*  RZA was from Staten Island. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1244.0s)]
*  You know we all we all Brooklyn babies too majority of us in the Klan. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1248.0s)]
*  We all you know resided in Staten Island but majority of us grew up in Brooklyn. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1252.0s)]
*  But anyway it was those three that were close as shit. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1257.0s)]
*  So RZA back then RZA he had knowledge of self which was you know being involved with the nation of Islam and also Jizza and old dirty they were a part of the nation at that time. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1262.0s)]
*  So they would go to a lot of rallies. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1276.0s)]
*  This is a place where everybody go when they build they talking about mathematics and all of this. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1279.0s)]
*  But it was Jizza and old dirty who instilled the hip hop into RZA. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1284.0s)]
*  So RZA was a DJ back then but he knew how to rhyme too and he knew how to rhyme because of his cousins. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1290.0s)]
*  So they kind of had this gang called not a gang but they had this thing called the All In Together Now crew. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1296.0s)]
*  Which was them three and they would run around and they would battle you know different guys from different cities and move around. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1302.0s)]
*  So you know some was kind of knew what they were about. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1309.0s)]
*  You know a lot of us you know found out later who they were but when Jizza and old dirty came to Staten Island they came and they hang out with their cousin. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1312.0s)]
*  So you know we started to see them a little bit more and know that you know you heard about your rhymes and you know and dirty he was just a crazy motherfucker back then. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1321.0s)]
*  He was crazy but yeah they had their own little thing going on. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1331.0s)]
*  And then you know next thing you know Jizza caught a record deal. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1336.0s)]
*  He caught a record deal which was rare back then. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1339.0s)]
*  Like if you had to if you fucking caught a record deal that mean that you had to have relationships. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1343.0s)]
*  You had to know where to go. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1347.0s)]
*  You had to have some type of connects. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1349.0s)]
*  So that's what gravitated Rizza into wanting to do it because he seen that his cousin had was able to you know crack the code on making a record. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1352.0s)]
*  So when that happened it was almost like it magnetized Rizza to be like yo I got to make a record now too. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1362.0s)]
*  You know and the next thing you know that's they had they movement going on. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1370.0s)]
*  So us from the outside looking it was like oh shit yo we know them we know they super passionate about you know being in the game and doing whatever they want to do. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1374.0s)]
*  But we wasn't thinking that far. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1385.0s)]
*  We just loved the music in general. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1388.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1390.0s)]
*  So and then so Rizza is essentially the mastermind to put all the pieces together and to bring all you killers into one under one roof. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1391.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1400.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1401.0s)]
*  It's amazing how we saw that because again that's not something that existed. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1402.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1406.0s)]
*  It's like Eric B and Rakim you know there was you know there was a few EPMD there's a few people. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1407.0s)]
*  You know your shit. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1412.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1413.0s)]
*  Gangstar. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1414.0s)]
*  There was a few people that were together but it wasn't like you guys. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1415.0s)]
*  Nah nah because. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1418.0s)]
*  It was kind of scary. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1419.0s)]
*  It was like god damn when you guys had a show. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1420.0s)]
*  I mean I heard stories that it was just like you guys would show up like 300 people. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1423.0s)]
*  Yeah that was you know that was some neighborhood shit. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1427.0s)]
*  But yeah like you said that was so rare to see a group that come out like that and it was really a mistake. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1430.0s)]
*  It wasn't really designed to be that way. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1436.0s)]
*  But when Rizza had a record situation and they tried to make him be something that he wasn't. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1439.0s)]
*  Always the case. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1446.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1448.0s)]
*  He was like yo fuck that. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1449.0s)]
*  I don't even care about the shit at this level no more I want to create this now and I'm bringing in all my guys. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1450.0s)]
*  And you know he just he just put that number together. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1456.0s)]
*  So believe it or not I was one of the guys that he called first because we used to hang out like like I tell people all the time like yo I might have been Rizza's first you know big fan. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1459.0s)]
*  So I kind of seen something in him already. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1472.0s)]
*  I seen something. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1474.0s)]
*  I'm like yo this guy really you know him and his cousins and I'm like yo these motherfuckers really got talent. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1475.0s)]
*  You know not only the ability to rhyme but they was clever like took my clout. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1481.0s)]
*  Right right right. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1485.0s)]
*  You know and he was mixing it with the knowledge and you know smart rhymes not not these fucking regular Humpty Dumpty lines like I'm talking about serious rhymes. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1486.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1496.0s)]
*  I'm like damn you know what I mean like yo so you know this is something that I felt like I would want to go chill with them just to be in the mix and be a fly on the wall. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1497.0s)]
*  Wasn't even thinking about being no fucking rapper. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1507.0s)]
*  I didn't give a fuck. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1509.0s)]
*  I just love the music but I'm watching these motherfuckers. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1510.0s)]
*  I'm like something about these motherfuckers that I love. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1513.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1518.0s)]
*  You know the next thing you know when Rizza you know Rizza went out there and he came back to the community he was like yo I caught a record deal. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1519.0s)]
*  So you know I was there. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1528.0s)]

*  Yeah the fine print and shit. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1538.0s)]
*  Yo this motherfucker made a record. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1539.0s)]
*  Holy shit yo. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1540.0s)]
*  Bow. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1541.0s)]
*  Stat Malin. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1542.0s)]
*  That's what's up. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1543.0s)]
*  We up. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1544.0s)]
*  You know but his situation ain't work out the way he wanted it to. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1545.0s)]
*  And that's when he came back and he started to be like yo chef. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1548.0s)]
*  This is what I'm trying to do. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1551.0s)]
*  Well the dangerous thing for young artists in every industry is when you have potential and you're young you sign a fucking contract and you don't know what's going on and then you get locked into these people. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1553.0s)]
*  And then a lot of times you're getting fucked. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1564.0s)]
*  Oh it's a mandatory. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1566.0s)]
*  Oh you know you're getting fucked. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1567.0s)]
*  It's a mandatory. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1568.0s)]
*  Mandatory. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1569.0s)]
*  Mandatory. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1570.0s)]
*  You're getting fucked which is how they make their money. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1571.0s)]
*  They make money by fucking young artists who don't know any better and by the time someone gets to like a prince's level he's like oh you owe me I'm a fucking squeaky line suck my dick. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1572.0s)]
*  He performs as a symbol. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1582.0s)]
*  I mean that's why he performed as a symbol because they owned him. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1584.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1587.0s)]
*  You take like the most talented people in the world and they get owned by people who provide music to the people. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1588.0s)]
*  They get owned by people who provide no value. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1594.0s)]
*  Especially today. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1597.0s)]
*  Today it's even crazier right because there is no record sales anymore. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1598.0s)]
*  It's all gone. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1602.0s)]
*  It's over baby. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1603.0s)]
*  It's all gone. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1604.0s)]
*  So for a young artist it's so important that they stay independent as long as they can. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1605.0s)]
*  Like you're hanging off a bridge. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1610.0s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1611.0s)]
*  Hang on and keep grinding. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1612.0s)]
*  Don't sell it. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1614.0s)]
*  Don't sign. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1615.0s)]
*  If you sign you're going to be fighting that shit 10 years from now. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1616.0s)]
*  You're going to be in court 10 years from now. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1619.0s)]
*  You're right. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1621.0s)]
*  Somebody's going to be getting not just 50 percent but like some fucking insane like Bill Burr was explaining this about his first comedy CD that he got a 60 40 deal. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1622.0s)]
*  He's like oh great 60 40 but it's not really 60 40 because he has to pay for all the distribution. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1633.0s)]
*  Yeah all the all the printing of the CDs. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1640.0s)]
*  Everything came out of his money. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1643.0s)]
*  I ask you a question. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1645.0s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1646.0s)]
*  Put yourself in an artist situation. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1647.0s)]
*  You have talent right. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1650.0s)]
*  You have talent. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1651.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1652.0s)]
*  I got I got everything you want. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1653.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1654.0s)]
*  You're going to have to make some sacrifices. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1655.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1659.0s)]
*  Because you know that. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1660.0s)]
*  Yeah you may you may feel like you got talent but I don't have the resources. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1661.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1665.0s)]
*  So those resources come and tell you. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1666.0s)]
*  Yo look I'll give you a shot. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1668.0s)]
*  I'll give you a shot but either you take this shot or you stay in the hood. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1671.0s)]
*  What are you going to do. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1678.0s)]
*  You're going to take the shot. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1679.0s)]
*  I take the shot. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1680.0s)]
*  You're going to take the shot. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1681.0s)]
*  And I agree with everybody who takes that shot. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1682.0s)]
*  I'm just letting them know. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1683.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1684.0s)]
*  I'm just letting them know. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1685.0s)]
*  You're getting fucked. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1686.0s)]
*  You're getting fucked. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1687.0s)]
*  But but see it's the sacrifice that I'm trying to explain to you that every every artist [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1688.0s)]
*  takes. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1693.0s)]
*  They takes that sacrifice because at the end of the day you have to start from somewhere. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1694.0s)]
*  So even when labels are being them. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1700.0s)]
*  In my mind I'm saying yo I get a chance to have a job Joe. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1703.0s)]
*  Niggas ain't never had no fucking job in their life. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1708.0s)]
*  And now we get a chance to do something that you could maybe think that you could change [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1711.0s)]
*  the world with and love. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1716.0s)]
*  It's like you're going to go for it. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1718.0s)]
*  So for us back then being kids we didn't give a fuck. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1719.0s)]
*  We didn't care about signing. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1722.0s)]
*  Yo I'll sign because what the fuck I got to lose. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1724.0s)]
*  I've been through everything. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1727.0s)]
*  I didn't I didn't been over here. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1728.0s)]
*  I've been kicked out of everywhere. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1730.0s)]
*  Fuck it. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1732.0s)]
*  I just want to be heard. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1733.0s)]
*  So a lot of time that be the protocol is just to be heard. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1734.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1739.0s)]
*  To be heard to be able to say yo something happened. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1740.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1743.0s)]
*  A lot of artists got robbed. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1745.0s)]
*  A lot. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1747.0s)]
*  A lot of artists and especially our our old geez that did it before us like you know what [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1748.0s)]
*  I mean. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1753.0s)]
*  Sugar Hill gangs all these different guys. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1754.0s)]
*  They all have been manipulated to do what they had to do. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1756.0s)]
*  But it almost gave them power too because they became famous. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1762.0s)]
*  They became big. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1767.0s)]
*  They became less. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1768.0s)]
*  There's an argument for that but I think it should be more fair. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1769.0s)]
*  Oh listen. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1771.0s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1772.0s)]
*  Oh of course you are. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1773.0s)]
*  I'm with you on that. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1774.0s)]
*  Of course you are. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1775.0s)]
*  But we just talking about the sacrifice. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1776.0s)]
*  What you got to do. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1777.0s)]
*  You have to do it. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1778.0s)]
*  Sacrifice is everything. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1779.0s)]
*  If you're a young kid and that's step one and now you're on the runway. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1780.0s)]
*  Okay you got to take it. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1783.0s)]
*  You got to take it. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1784.0s)]
*  But it just should be more fair. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1785.0s)]
*  Oh I agree. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1787.0s)]
*  You shouldn't lock people in for life. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1788.0s)]
*  And I'm sure later on things worked out and you know now that you proved yourself. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1789.0s)]
*  Once they become undeniable. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1794.0s)]
*  It's like I tell a motherfucker this. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1796.0s)]
*  I'm like imagine you were a hustler right and you run into the Kinect and the Kinect [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1798.0s)]
*  say yo you talking like you know how to move shit. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1803.0s)]
*  I'm gonna give you 50 pounds of marijuana back then. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1806.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1809.0s)]
*  Now you may feel like at the end of the day you can handle it but a motherfucker tell you [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1810.0s)]
*  Joe I'm giving you these fucking 50 pounds. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1815.0s)]
*  I need my money back today at this time. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1818.0s)]
*  You can either take the 50 because you so fucking confident or take one and say yo I [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1822.0s)]
*  rather take my time. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1827.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1828.0s)]

*  He wants to fucking get his head fucking chopped off. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1835.0s)]
*  You got to take the 50. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1838.0s)]

*  You got to know people. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1840.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1841.0s)]
*  And you got to bring everybody in and you got to share the money. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1842.0s)]
*  See you got to know people. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1844.0s)]
*  You got to share the money. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1845.0s)]
*  You got to know people. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1846.0s)]
*  Now if you ain't confident in knowing what the fuck you need to know I advise you don't [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1847.0s)]
*  take them. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1851.0s)]
*  You shouldn't be having that conversation. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1852.0s)]
*  You shouldn't be having that conversation. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1853.0s)]
*  If you don't know anybody. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1854.0s)]
*  But if you know some people and you're generous. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1855.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1857.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1858.0s)]
*  You got to make it worth these people's while. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1859.0s)]
*  That's the key thing. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1860.0s)]
*  You got to say listen we're all going to get something out of this. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1861.0s)]
*  And see now look that philosophy that you said is what we took on. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1864.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1868.0s)]
*  We took that on. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1869.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1870.0s)]
*  We said you know what at the end of the day we'll take this little bit of money but we [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1871.0s)]
*  going to go we going to be willing to sell ourselves to get to this level. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1875.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1879.0s)]
*  Because we know what we believe in. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1880.0s)]
*  See it all starts from what you believe. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1881.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1883.0s)]
*  If you don't have the belief in yourself to make it happen you fucked. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1884.0s)]
*  It's a rising tides lifts all boats thing too. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1888.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1891.0s)]
*  And with Wu-Tang Clan that was for sure a big thing. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1892.0s)]
*  Because anybody that was associated with Wu-Tang Clan was automatically respected. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1895.0s)]
*  Automatically people wanted to listen. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1899.0s)]
*  Automatically. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1901.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1902.0s)]
*  Automatically. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1903.0s)]
*  And you know that just lifts everybody. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1904.0s)]
*  That lifts everybody. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1906.0s)]
*  But it's hard for people to see that. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1907.0s)]
*  Everybody thinks about themselves especially when you're struggling. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1908.0s)]
*  When you're struggling then you're scared. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1911.0s)]
*  And you know scared money doesn't make money. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1913.0s)]
*  It don't make money. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1915.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1916.0s)]
*  Everybody gets paranoid. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1917.0s)]
*  And they think no that's when you got to bond together. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1918.0s)]
*  That's when everybody you have to find real people and stick together. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1921.0s)]
*  You said the key word. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1924.0s)]
*  You got to sell that 50. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1925.0s)]
*  You got to know you. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1926.0s)]
*  We got to sell that 50. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1927.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1928.0s)]
*  Talk to Carlos. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1929.0s)]
*  Go down to the bodega. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1930.0s)]
*  Go down to the bodega. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1932.0s)]
*  Let's make a deal man. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1934.0s)]
*  We got to make some deals. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1935.0s)]
*  We got 10 hours. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1936.0s)]
*  I guess that's what Reza did is that he danced with the devil for the right reason. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1937.0s)]
*  And you know we took some scars. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1942.0s)]
*  We got hit. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1945.0s)]
*  It was a different world back then too in terms of the industry. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1946.0s)]
*  Because today all you need is a social media account, Spotify, SoundCloud. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1949.0s)]
*  You can blow up. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1954.0s)]
*  You can blow up today. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1955.0s)]
*  Back then you needed the radio. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1956.0s)]
*  You needed, you know you could sell mixed tapes. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1959.0s)]
*  But it's hard. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1962.0s)]
*  You had to be some undeniable talent. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1963.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1966.0s)]
*  You know like we always played the video of Biggie when he was 17 on the street. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1967.0s)]
*  Remember that video? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1971.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=1972.0s)]

*  Of course. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=2004.0s)]
*  I mean but that's what made us learn is that we had to grow through, we had to go through those growing pains. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=2005.0s)]
*  We had to get jerked to learn how to say yo that was a lesson. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=2011.0s)]

*  Some people are scared of opportunities when they come. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=2040.0s)]
*  And it's like if a person offered you an opportunity nine times out of ten it may not work for you the way you want it to work but it might be an opportunity to help you. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=2043.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=2084.0s)]

*  what it's all about at the end of the day man just kind of like get a peace of mind and vibe [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3698.64s)]
*  vibe to something different though yeah i always say that for artists too you should find some [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3703.52s)]
*  other thing you like to do just to give you a little break mentally from whatever you're trying [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3708.3199999999997s)]
*  to do exactly you could get too close to something and lose sight of the big picture if you're all [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3712.64s)]
*  wrapped up in it you're so tight into one sometimes you need something else that you also enjoy outside [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3719.2s)]
*  of it and then you can look at what you do okay what am i doing different exactly maybe i should [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3723.8399999999997s)]
*  put a new wrinkle in this maybe i should take a new turn you know mix it up man that's important [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3729.12s)]
*  yeah you know what what's another cool thing about today is that um it used to be thought at one [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3735.04s)]
*  point in time i think it was like the early 2000s that rap had that hip hop had a shelf life and [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3741.68s)]
*  that there wouldn't be classics you know what i mean like the rolling stones were still touring [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3750.7999999999997s)]
*  you know they were 58 years old back then like this is crazy the rolling stones are back on the [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3755.28s)]
*  road but that was like a new thing it was like old rock and roll guys out touring was a new thing [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3759.76s)]
*  but with hip hop artists like if you weren't in now if you weren't new now it kind of people [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3765.6000000000004s)]

*  because i see some of my legends still doing it today but um yeah man like you said just to [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3787.1200000000003s)]

*  because you didn't think that it would last right you know what i mean so you felt like [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3807.12s)]
*  you would get a five-year run they say any artist that was coming out back in the 90s [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=3812.88s)]

*  expression you know yeah being in the studio smoking a lot of weed you know and a lot of [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6442.72s)]
*  times when we were smoking and just vibing it's like we were mentioning things that [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6447.68s)]
*  you know like today like prime example you know i own i own a cannabis business um in newark [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6454.32s)]
*  called hash story you know and see you representing us you know um we said in rhymes like can it be [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6460.24s)]

*  at the end of the day like you know now as i sit here and i'm an owner of a cannabis business i'm [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6478.88s)]

*  saying things that meant so much to us back then but still dreaming of it being a reality the next [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6497.68s)]
*  thing you know what happens you know um like how you said you know jizz are being so intelligent [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6505.12s)]
*  and talking about science and you know meth you know talking about certain things and you know [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6511.5199999999995s)]

*  were going through our minds as we were just smoking and listening to production and just [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6525.04s)]
*  saying yo what what the right next where do we want to go you know and i think that that [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6529.92s)]
*  is important as an artist is to dream and be creative don't sit in one box like that's the [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6536.16s)]
*  shit that just be driving me crazy a lot with hip-hop today it's like yo it's just sounding too [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6542.72s)]
*  fucking repetitious like let's make it bigger let's let's take it over here over here over here [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6548.72s)]
*  but it just sometimes it's just sitting in one fucking box where it's like yo come on we gotta [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6556.16s)]
*  it's not just that it's about opening up opening up the doors for everybody to be able to [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6562.08s)]
*  see so many sides like now it just seems like like the hip-hop shit is just being controlled by [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6569.12s)]
*  one person that's saying yo we want y'all to stay right there we want you to talk ignorant we want [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6576.5599999999995s)]
*  you to not grow we want you to just whatever they think is gonna sell why is that why is that the [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6581.68s)]
*  case because the same reason why they were trying to take the rizza and change him and turn him into [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6588.08s)]
*  something he's not people always do that they do that in comedy they do that in podcasting they [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6592.8s)]
*  do that in music there's always some executive that thinks they know better and they're gonna [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6598.240000000001s)]
*  mold you and shape you and change you and this is what we're gonna do we're gonna hire an image [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6602.400000000001s)]
*  team we're gonna do it's all just bullshit it's non-artists interfering with art that's what it is [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6606.72s)]
*  it's when you have middlemen you know you have these people that profit off of your talent and [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6614.64s)]
*  they think they're gonna steer it in a way that's going to be the most profitable they don't give a [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6619.76s)]
*  fuck if you're like earnestly and honestly expressing yourself that doesn't mean anything [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6623.360000000001s)]
*  to them they just want you to stay in that box because that's the box they're selling [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6627.360000000001s)]
*  and once it sells once they don't want you to change it up remember when iced tea [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6632.32s)]
*  started a fucking heavy metal band oh my god yeah iced tea who played a cop on tv for like fucking [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6636.5599999999995s)]
*  30 years he had a song called cop killer body count and everybody wanted him to be the rapper [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6642.24s)]
*  and iced tea was like i'm gonna do a hardcore album it was like what i'm a motherfucking cop [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6648.48s)]
*  kill it's like what is this what is this this is crazy yeah but it's like he just didn't listen [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6654.24s)]
*  he's like i don't give a fuck what you say i'm gonna do what i want to do this is what i want [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6659.52s)]
*  to do now exactly and you have to give an artist that ability to do that they have to be able to [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6663.84s)]
*  change it up anytime they want whatever because whatever got them to the dance is going to keep [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6668.320000000001s)]
*  them dancing and they might dance to the beat of a different song but it's going to be the same [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6673.76s)]
*  the same person that same creative force that created whatever you liked in the beginning [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6678.400000000001s)]
*  well you probably like this new direction they're going to go into because it's going to be just as [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6683.92s)]
*  good it's like we all like different like you were saying you like billy joe we both like cool g rap [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6687.44s)]
*  it's very different you wouldn't want to see the two of them at a concert together you know but [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6692.639999999999s)]
*  but that's what you have to give room for an artist and these executives and these people that [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6696.88s)]
*  are profiting off of art without being creative their input's always terrible it's always terrible [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6702.08s)]
*  because they don't have a vision they don't really unless you're like a rick rubin like one of those [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6708.48s)]
*  cats it's just like super eccentric weirdo genius dude who just knows what he likes and go hold on [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6713.44s)]

*  yeah you those guys be great in their own way though you know they're artists though [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6736.96s)]
*  it's like that's different but when you get these suits and the suits get involved and they know [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6741.4400000000005s)]

*  important things about hip-hop too is like songs inspire people to change their lives like [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6769.44s)]
*  like gangsta song discipline like that song inspires you to have discipline serious song [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=6774.4s)]

*  ill it's a great idea you know what i mean so my thing is to talk about it in a way to where the [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=7017.04s)]
*  way we made the album all the experiences all the things that we went through and eventually that [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=7022.72s)]
*  would wind up becoming a movie later on because the storyboard of how i talk about it is going [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=7029.04s)]
*  to blow people's minds because it's like damn this is what you was going through this is [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=7036.24s)]
*  this is how your mindset was because i just want people to know that that album was made because [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=7040.320000000001s)]

*  martin scorsese mindset because when i came in the clan i was like yo i don't do all the karate [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXg71gE_cZU&t=7059.679999999999s)]
