# Joe Rogan Experience #2337 - Oliver Anthony
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6.0s)]
*  And we're up my friend, how are you? Good to see you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10.0s)]
*  Long time no talk. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah brother, yeah. How you doing? You good? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=17.0s)]
*  Good. I, man, I remember like towards the last, the end of the last time I was here, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=20.0s)]
*  you said, oh yeah, we'll probably see you again in a couple years. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=25.0s)]
*  And I was just looking around like, yeah, I'll never see any of this again. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=28.0s)]
*  You're back quicker than you thought. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=31.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=33.0s)]
*  Bro, that new song is fire. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=34.0s)]
*  Thanks. Yeah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=37.0s)]
*  Woo! I played that song about 20 times in the green room. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=38.0s)]
*  And the first time I played it, everybody just sat around and went, oh shit. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=41.0s)]
*  It was so funny that, yeah, I didn't expect the song. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=47.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I didn't, I wasn't the one, I guess it was Adam that sent it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=50.0s)]
*  I don't even know how you got ahold of the song originally. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=54.0s)]
*  Yeah, Adam sent it to me originally. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=56.0s)]
*  Yeah, I sent it, I'd sent it to him like, yeah, just kind of, just to get his opinion of it or whatever. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=58.0s)]
*  And he's like, I got it. He's like, do you mind if I share this around? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=65.0s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, go ahead. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=68.0s)]
*  Bro, the first time I heard it was in the green room. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=69.0s)]
*  And the green room has a killer sound system. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=71.0s)]
*  So we put it on the Bluetooth and cranked it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=74.0s)]
*  And all of us, there's like 10 dudes in that room going, oh shit. Oh shit. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=77.0s)]
*  Some of those slides like, oh shit. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=82.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=85.0s)]
*  Woo. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=86.0s)]
*  What makes that song different, I guess, than anything I've done or than a lot of music now is that we're, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=87.0s)]
*  we tried to like do it the way Leonard Skinner or somebody would back in this, where we're all just in the house. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=93.0s)]
*  And there's no like, man, there's so much editing that goes into music now on the back end and stuff. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=98.0s)]
*  And with this, we're just like in there doing it and, you know, try to keep it as real as possible. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=103.0s)]
*  Like, you know, there's no, there's no click tracks. There's no real editing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=108.0s)]
*  It's just kind of like we're all just in this house. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=113.0s)]
*  I mean, it's it was the worst timing to record. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=115.0s)]
*  But that was that January 5th, 6th, 7th window was the only time that everybody can meet up. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=118.0s)]
*  You know, Billy Contreras on the fiddle and everybody. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=124.0s)]
*  And because he tours with Ricky Skaggs and he's kind of all over the place. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=127.0s)]
*  So that was like our time to meet. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=130.0s)]
*  So a couple of days before we all went to West Virginia to record in my house up there, the dislike, terrible storm they were calling for. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=131.0s)]
*  It's like the worst one since the 90s, supposedly. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=139.0s)]
*  Or that's what Draven says. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=141.0s)]
*  But so we got all the snow, all this ice. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=142.0s)]
*  So so, yeah, we used a side by side in the Jeep to haul everything up and down. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=145.0s)]
*  It was like just all we could do to get up and down to the house. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=151.0s)]
*  And then it's right as soon as we get everything plugged in, ready to go, the power knocks out. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=154.0s)]
*  I was like we were all just so discouraged. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=161.0s)]
*  And luckily, you know, there's a Lowe's not terribly far away. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=163.0s)]
*  And they had one they had like a Honda inverter generator that was like safe to plug everything into, you know, like where the waves aren't going to mess everything up. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=167.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, we, you know, we recorded the song while on a generator. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=175.0s)]
*  So you have to worry about the waves of the generator, like the sound of the generators. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=179.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? No, like the electrical like plugging all of that expensive equipment into just like a yeah, a generator that's on an inverter like the voltage like goes up and down, I guess. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=183.0s)]
*  Or I don't know. That's all above my pay grade. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=194.0s)]
*  But we had to find one that was like safe to plug all that equipment into, you know, maybe that's something in the song, too. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=196.0s)]
*  You know, like maybe that you're trapped in a storm. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=205.0s)]
*  That's a scary song, dude. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=208.0s)]
*  It's a scary. I can't wait for the. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=211.0s)]
*  Yeah. See, I hadn't put a lot of new music out because. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=213.0s)]
*  Well, I think back to even when I was here last time and before we did the episode and all walking around on the sidewalk out in front of the hotel with Draven and a couple other people arguing that I needed to just cash out from Richmond and roll and not make this into a long term thing because I just. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=217.0s)]
*  Well, dude, I just don't some people thrive in this environment like everybody looking at them. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=234.0s)]
*  But I to me it's just like so it just it kind of takes it kind of takes a little bit out of me putting new music out. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=239.0s)]
*  And so, you know, after Richmond, I only had this two new songs. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=245.0s)]
*  I really just wanted to let everything kind of slow down and I could still maybe do five or ten shows a year and make a little bit. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=248.0s)]
*  But I wasn't trying to be like a superstar. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=255.0s)]
*  I didn't want everybody just to be I didn't want to be stuck in that spot. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=257.0s)]
*  I was when I was at Richmond where everybody's just like obsessing over stuff. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=260.0s)]
*  And so I kind of just tried to let it die. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=264.0s)]
*  And then, you know, it wouldn't. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=266.0s)]
*  It was like the streams kept continuing and people were still messaging me and emailing and the shows were still selling out. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=268.0s)]
*  And I just realized like, I don't know, you know, I believed everybody that said this kid's got 15 minutes of fame and whatever. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=274.0s)]
*  And I would have been during when Richmond blew up, I would have been one of those guys who would have been like, oh, that stupid guy. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=282.0s)]
*  You know, like I would have been a hater, too. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=287.0s)]
*  So I was almost like rooting for them like, yeah, you know, because you got to think, man, the first check from Richmond. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=290.0s)]
*  And the first check from Richmond was eight hundred thousand dollars. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=295.0s)]
*  Like I can I could have lived a long time off of that money. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=298.0s)]
*  You know, like I don't need a whole lot of like that was great. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=301.0s)]
*  You know, that was a decade or more of work for me easily. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=303.0s)]
*  And so I was like, I was like, heck, yeah, I'm good. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=307.0s)]
*  I'll just take it, you know. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=309.0s)]
*  And anyway, I say all that to say that now it's like I'm going to at least just I'm going to at least just hit it good one more time. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=310.0s)]
*  I've got we've got six songs recorded now to come after scornful that are all like I'm pretty proud of them. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=318.0s)]
*  They're pretty good. And so I'm going to put those out and then who knows after that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=324.0s)]
*  But let me tell you what's going to happen. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=328.0s)]
*  You got a relationship with those people now, man. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=330.0s)]
*  They love you. Yeah. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=333.0s)]
*  It's just your mission in life. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=336.0s)]
*  You know, you just got handed a wild hand of cards and this is your your deck of cards. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=339.0s)]
*  You know, your deck of cards is or your hand of cards is you put this song out, this authentic song. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=344.0s)]
*  That's very simple. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=351.0s)]
*  And this time we're nothing simple. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=353.0s)]
*  And this time where everything's confusing and you don't know who's telling the truth. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=355.0s)]
*  The news is lying to you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=360.0s)]
*  Everything is being funded. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=362.0s)]
*  Nothing's organic. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=364.0s)]
*  It's half the fucking traffic on social media is bots. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=366.0s)]
*  At least politicians are lying. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=369.0s)]
*  Everybody's confused. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=372.0s)]
*  People are simping for politicians. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=374.0s)]
*  They're getting paid to repeat talking points on television and on podcasts and all over social media. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=376.0s)]
*  So when someone comes out with something like that is just that dude telling you how he feels. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=382.0s)]
*  Yeah. Real. Raw. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=387.0s)]
*  You know, I remember we had that conversation on the phone and I was like, if you can do that, you could do that again. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=389.0s)]
*  You don't they don't need anybody else. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=394.0s)]
*  You don't need these motherfuckers who want you to cash out all these money. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=396.0s)]
*  They just they they're doing that because they think that you're gullible. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=399.0s)]
*  They think that you're naive in the ways of the entertainment music business. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=403.0s)]
*  The first fucking live show you ever performed was a giant sold out show at a state fair. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=408.0s)]
*  You know how crazy that is? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=414.0s)]
*  As your first live show. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=416.0s)]
*  Well, that that very first show was actually it was even more amateur than that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=418.0s)]
*  It was at a farm market. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=422.0s)]
*  It wasn't even there weren't even any tickets. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=424.0s)]
*  It was just like so it's crazy how it all it just it goes back to when I still believe just as much now as I did the last time I was here about and I definitely won't bug everybody too much with all my hokey pokey religious stuff. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=427.0s)]
*  Either like I definitely want to read a little bit out before we go. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=437.0s)]
*  But I do believe it was just it was all too perfectly timed. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=440.0s)]
*  But I had actually picked that date out at the at the farm market before Richmond blew up. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=444.0s)]
*  That was going to be my that was going to be my first time playing live either way. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=448.0s)]
*  That date it was like August the 12th. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=452.0s)]
*  I think I had booked it back in July with that Morris farm market. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=454.0s)]
*  I was going to get 200 bucks and go play for like it was like two and a half hours. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=458.0s)]
*  Like seriously. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=462.0s)]
*  In that time that's what happened. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=464.0s)]
*  So I already had that date picked and yeah it was just at a farm market and kind of near the beach and Outer Banks and they say like 12,000 people showed up. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=466.0s)]
*  That was the very first one. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=473.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=476.0s)]
*  And I just I remember even then like I just I just expected everybody to sing Richmond and that was going to be it and it'd be cool. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=477.0s)]
*  And I go back to work the next week. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=483.0s)]
*  But it was like even in that crowd at that very first show all the other songs they knew the words to too. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=484.0s)]
*  And I was like this is like something you know. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=489.0s)]
*  But the important thing too is that the important thing to take away from this and I said this during Richmond but you know it was like take me out of it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=491.0s)]
*  The fact that people can now choose what they want and push it to the top even in a system that's rigged where there is bots and there's mass marketing money going into songs and like labels spend a million dollars on their own song to get it up the label. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=502.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=517.0s)]
*  The fact that people can just decide they like something and just shoot it up to the top like people need to realize how much power and influence they have at least for a short period in time in society. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=518.0s)]
*  It's like the stars are aligned where we can kind of it's funny technology like can only develop on the backs of people using it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=527.0s)]
*  And so like AI and and all of this over the years social media like all the back end of that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=536.0s)]
*  It's been it's all that information's being sort of extracted from us like you think about like the like the way a Tesla car rides on the road and it's watching you drive and you're like it's like reading your analytics so it can learn how to drive better. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=541.0s)]
*  We know AI. That's the only reason why they let everybody use AI is so it can make the AI. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=554.0s)]
*  It's the user input that's that's what makes it you know. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=559.0s)]
*  And so for a very short period in time it's like the stars are aligned where they're having to like while they're sucking all the humanity out of us to put into this AI we also have full access to it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=562.0s)]
*  And like so we can do like even in the even in the music business you know everything that the label used to held exclusive control over like the publicity and the marketing and the digital streaming service relationships like all that stuff is now just a la carte to anybody. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=572.0s)]
*  Like you don't need the you don't need those big companies all that stuff you can just go and hire a really good social media person and you can work with a good music distributor without having to sign anything or give any of your rights up and right now the people have the power is what I mean for like a very short period of time. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=587.0s)]
*  But this should be this should just be a reminder of that this song being able to go up into the iTunes charts even with stuff with way bigger audiences with all kinds of marketing reach you know the fact that this can just organically go into the iTunes charts like that and people you know it's just. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=602.0s)]
*  That's the thing that's the thing I always take away from it is just like damn dude if we could just get organized even for like two or three years we could just fix everything like we have like the people really do have the power at least right now for a short window of time but we really do I mean we did. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=618.0s)]
*  But people have to understand that we are all in this together and that there's organizations that want to drive us apart and the way to work out our differences is having conversations and negotiations and figuring out how to work it out it's not lighting cop cars on fire like this is you know. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=633.0s)]
*  But the spirit of those like not to defend any of that crap but I just that rebellious nature in us is important too though it just has to be it has to be directed correctly you shouldn't be burning way most while holding a Mexican flag trying not to get sent back to Mexico I mean you're confusing the fuck out of me dog. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=652.0s)]
*  Like who is your oppressor is it the electric car is it the country which you know you want to stay but you're holding a flag of another country like what's why you wearing a mask are you proud of this do you not want to get arrested what are we doing are you scared of covid like I want to know. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=670.0s)]
*  Well it goes back to what you said about mass manipulation and also like we don't we've all sort of lost our identity that's why politics has become so prevalent and like the way people represent themselves to other people and like you know that's like as our as our culture and our tradition and like sort of the. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=689.0s)]
*  Like we're just sort of all we're just little boats out in the big ocean and we're looking for somewhere to we're looking for some kind of identity to reach out and grab and politics they make politics so easy to reach out and grab and make just like in the same way that people just absorb themselves into sports exactly you know they're way out of shape but they like they refer to their sports team as we like our defense did really does that all the time we want to talk about a college where I'm from somewhere in the world where I'm from and I'm like I'm from the same place where I'm from and I'm like I'm from the same place where I'm from and I'm like I'm from the same place where I'm from and I'm like I'm from the same place where I'm from and I'm like I'm from the same place where I'm from and I'm like I'm from the same place where I'm from and I'm like I'm from the same place where I'm from and I'm like I'm like I'm from [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=710.0s)]
*  college where he's from well that's maybe maybe if he's from there though then it doesn't count I'm just fucking around yeah I'm a I'm not a team sports guy you know I'm a combat sports guy and I would never say we won like if you [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=740.0s)]
*  beat somebody I never say we won you know tomorrow would call me up what the fuck are you saying man we you know what I did in camp you know I mean rounds I sparred you know yeah all the punches you took it's so crazy but if there's a group of guys you can say we but that's I see that like I just see that becoming more and more prevalent where there's not like I don't know it's sort of just like it's kind of even even to expand on the thought of it it's even like the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=754.18s)]
*  way that now we've all just sort of we're all in these subcategories of the way we would be if we were in prison we're all like right you know like in the same way that when we use the word black and white to describe like how many different types of white and black are there that all just get merged it's like it's a like creates this maybe like group identity that's a lot easier to control like sure well and then it shifts over time like my family wasn't white my family was Italian they were they were disparaged when they first came to America from Europe [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=784.18s)]
*  my grandfather's tell me terrible stories what happened to him when he was a boy living in America as an Italian they treated them the same way terribly racist people were treating people from Guatemala that sneak in here it's the same kind of thing then after a while they sort of integrated and now I'm white yeah now now you're just a white person now just a regular white but it's easy now and they're like in big public narrative and stuff to it's easy it's a lot easier to accuse you and 30 other different nationalities of people [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=814.18s)]
*  who are all very culturally different and unique and just call all of you white people and then pick the worst thing that one of those nationalities did and just cast it among the whole group but it happens with that with every ethnicity every identity the goal is to like put everyone in the world in one of three or four buckets and then hopefully figure out how to just put all of them into one bucket eventually it's like it's just Matt it's just it's so much easier to control two or three different types of people than it is 30 or 40 or a hundred or a thousand you know which is also I think why they never fix the problems that [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=844.18s)]
*  deal our inner cities they they want to keep that conflict I really believe that because if somebody wanted to have a better stronger economy the first thing you would do is you want more people in the workforce so you'd want less people that are disenfranchised completely out of society felons all that stuff that doesn't do anything but cost the country money right unless you have private prisons now private prisons those people become a business and then that business contributes to the [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=874.18s)]
*  escalation of laws they want to make sure the law stay in place because that way their business is always full they have plenty of customers their customers are human beings that they turn into batteries to generate money that's what it is like those people every person they have in there they get more money which is why it's wild that we allow that but then it's also like keeping a certain amount of crime in certain areas ensures that you're always going to have debates over law enforcement you're always going [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=904.18s)]
*  to have conversations over disenfranchised we need DEI we need this we need quotas we need to hire more people of this or of that ignoring the fact that these a lot of these things especially with universities are the most racist especially towards Asians the racist is fucked towards Asians there's lawsuits about it Harvard is that still going on the Harvard lawsuit where they specifically made their application [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=934.18s)]
*  process like the whole acceptance process more difficult for Asians because they were kicking too much ass they had too many Asian people that were willing to fucking work their ass off study 12 hours a day get straight A's like man there's too many of these folks we gotta make it tougher what did they do to make it more difficult specifically they attached a bunch of things I believe the argument is they attached a bunch of things like social stuff like how much do you engage in you know activism how [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=964.18s)]
*  often are you involved in you know social activities on campus you know what are the things are you doing other than just pure academic work they're like trying to slow them down they're literally trying to slow them down yeah that's another great example to like like even just to even just that they can blanket [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=994.18s)]
*  Asian like that as such a like like it's Indian it's Chinese there's a lot of but yeah people that come from a hard place are willing to work hard that's the difference and the problem with meritocracy is that some other fuckers will go for it and if you get a whole country people going for it that gets scary for the people that just want to take naps it's the same psychology that goes in like in a lot of the smaller Appalachian towns like like where we were we recorded was really close to Bramwell West Virginia but if you look at like [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1017.06s)]
*  even if you look at Bramwell West Virginia and their recent political history like the last mayor they had she she embezzled money from the town and there was like you know and this isn't a very small tent like so so government corruption exists like everywhere and it almost is like maybe in those big cities I understand definitely that I think things are intentionally neglected like to create chaos and to create this like you said this need for more resources and more but it's also just that maybe a lot of those people that are in positions are just very [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1047.06s)]
*  spineless and self-centered and like they don't even care that people are dying in their streets they're worried about the the money that can be made in the ego and the power of it goes back to kind of what I said in that ARCC speech about lack of leadership I just see that like if we had people in big cities or in small Appalachian towns that had like a real backbone to them and like and and had they were in a real position of like leadership where they wanted to fix things that a lot of that stuff would get addressed and covered but we just don't have the right people in power maybe even is what it is even in even in local and state government [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1077.06s)]
*  the right people don't run they don't want that job man they don't want that smoke they don't want people attacking them they don't want any of it the right people are the people that don't want to be president it's almost it's almost like they've made these positions only appealing to people who are like sort of criminals associate pass or criminals yeah for real like who the fuck wants to run everything you gotta be crazy I don't even like running my whole house I don't like having employees it's too much it's too much responsibility what do you think would happen if just some normal people ran the country though like just some average just like what if [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1107.06s)]
*  me and you just went ran the would have me if you ran for president what would happen if you like killed when you put a fucking convertible they would definitely they would definitely be able to hit my big head that's for sure they wouldn't [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1137.06s)]
*  my eyes not that little either you want a cigar yeah yeah let's do it get on that big dog well the I smoked a cigar with the guy one time that what happened this is the second it ended up all on the internet yeah this is your second cigar ever yeah I was keep it keep it running for a minute yeah just pull on it the the real [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1146.74s)]

*  yeah he brought me a case of them did I ever tell you there my Ron White story no I don't think so did you I'm gonna mess it all up but that's okay because that's what the that's what this is for is to mess stuff up so it was the night we [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1347.02s)]
*  recorded a gosh you my head is like spinning now from this thing this is crazy the night that we were tobacco the day that we recorded the podcast that night is when we went to the mothership mothership for the first time because Tom [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1360.18s)]
*  cigar invited me and right so we're sitting in there in the green room Ron White's there and Tom and a bunch of people William Montgomery and I got to meet all these really cool people that night and so Tom was like man you ought to get up at the end of our set and do a couple songs and we only had one guitar and I really wanted my guitar Joey you know the guy from he's in the scornful video Joey Davis I wanted him to get up there and get to do it with me and Ron's like well I got a guitar in my house but and dude he's gonna he's supposed to be getting on stage to do a set [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1371.5s)]
*  like less than an hour you know 45 minutes so him and Joey get in his car and they run every red light from his house in fact and go and get Ron White's guitar and that's what we use for a second minutes away that was such a risky move yeah like he said they flew there and back so you guys performed on stage at the mothership that was the first time a musical act that ever performed there supposedly yeah 100% except for back when it was a musical venue yeah I mean Stevie Ray Vaughn performed you saw the photos that [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1401.5s)]
*  we have in the tunnel yeah Stevie Ray Vaughn performing there I think it was 83 he was there I think if I think I think even by the end of this weekend we will be able to really have a good blueprint for sound in there again like it's a it's a small room but I think it would just sound like you could really have an immersive listening space for people to like just such a cool spot that maybe do music now oh yeah yeah I think it would be a great spot to do music it's just we're always packed with comedians you know we'd only do it for someone [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1431.5s)]
*  like you it could be a lot yeah it could be like every once in a while like I love the idea of it being like a live recorded thing that because I my favorite music to listen to is the live version of almost anything anyway oh yeah of people and it would be cool to go back and I mean our plan with this we're gonna record we'll record Friday and Saturday night and my plan is to put out some kind of mothership live at the mothership and have some of the money go back to the humane society oh that's awesome that's we're gonna record it and just see what happens see what happens but [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1461.5s)]
*  even if we just get a couple songs out of it or something and put them out oh that's badass but yeah I like that I really like the Austin Humane Society they I was looking at all their they got like some really funny dogs and stuff on there too but I I think it'd be I think it's cool getting to do something with them yeah I can't go to those places I would have a hundred dogs they got this one dog on their website I should have I should have sent it to you but I don't know maybe Jamie can find it but it's like there's this one like older dog I think he's a chihuahua or something but he's got this real funny name like buddy or [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1491.5s)]
*  something but he's like the most like he doesn't have any teeth his tongue's hanging out I was like that's my I could just take him home with me buddy or something I've had a bunch of rescue dogs in my life and it is a thing there's a like a relationship you have with them is different than any other dog like they fucking they're so they love you so much they're so happy you rescued them like they know that you rescued them was my dog Marshall he has no idea he's like living the best life he's just like everyone's my friend yeah he has he's never [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1521.5s)]
*  fucking growled at a person in his life he's nothing but sweet think about how lucky you got to be to be Joe Rogan's dog that's pretty cool like what's the odds that you might have a dog like him yeah he's the best dog ever yeah I know he's like a little human he's like a human like we have conversations like he he knows like not just words he knows like when I'm saying something like what to do like he mean that dog are like locked in it's wild he's the best he's just all love [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1551.5s)]
*  for everybody that comes over like when people come over the studio and he's here he just does a circle he's like I'm your friend and then it looks you I'm your friend and just keeps goes around and and he sees you the first thing he does flop on his back I know you want to rub my belly come on yeah he's just so used to being just loved on yeah I just got a well I had you know I had the three I had three dogs and then I lost my white shepherd like right after we got off a tour he got bone cancer and [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1581.5s)]
*  he was gone within like a month or month and a half it's a really important thing that we should probably tell people about right now and we're talking about cancer stop feeding your dog processed food I know it's expensive but if you can get it get yourself your dog real food there's companies like farmers dog that's what you use right farmers dog and they'll send you like real food and you feed your dog real food it's like real human-grade meat and vegetables your dog will be way better off just like you [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1611.5s)]
*  would be way better off anything that can sit on a shelf for six months and not rot is not good for you yeah it just sustains them you know and then you know obviously dogs are running around drinking out of puddles and you know what fucking toxins are exposed might need a lot of like horse shit and stuff too they're obsessed sure but they are you get but you're gonna get a healthier dog if you feed him real food that's all I'm saying I'm not saying secure to all ills but man it fixed my dog quick Marshall was starting to get a little chubby [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1641.5s)]
*  and we're trying to lessen his food but he was always hungry and I was like this sucks and then we found out the company that I'm using is Maeve M-A-E-V and they sell you frozen food and he eats it frozen and it's just meat and vegetables and he fucking loves it and he gobbles it up and he lost the body weight his coat looked better he had way more energy I'm like of course he's eating real food instead of eating some processed bullshit that's filled with preservatives you could sit on a fucking shelf [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1671.5s)]
*  for it like if you only ate protein bars all day long and nothing but protein bars you'd probably get sick how was that thing just sitting there like how how can you just live off plus you got you got to get tired eating the same thing every day yeah like at this point I mean I feel like for your dog he might as well live a pretty cool life he's got you know he's Joe Rogan's dog he can't just be eating regular dog food anyway I uh people don't know though they think dog food is what you give dogs that's the problem [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1701.5s)]
*  like they need to understand like dogs are just like any other animal like human beings what they eat has a giant effect on their overall physical health yeah yeah I I've been feeding mine eggs we've got a bunch of land birds now and meat birds and stuff oh that's nice they'll they just eat raw eggs how long do your meat birds live before you whack them so we just I just I've got some now that are about two weeks old and they'll be gone like [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1731.5s)]
*  they'll be gone before it starts to cool off it's quick it's um I want to say like two and a half months with them they get they get to the point where they get so fat they actually can't hold themselves up anymore that is so crazy yeah cuz I don't have meat birds I have egg laying hens and these little ladies just run around all day long you just let you run loose yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I do I do the chicken tractors but then I will let them out during the day some too just so they can run around but yeah it's good for them makes the eggs healthier but [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1761.5s)]
*  they're hilarious to watch too they're just great my friend who runs he he has meat ones and he said he waits until their legs break and I go what he goes they get so big that their legs break and that's yeah kill him I'm like Jesus Christ what did we do to these fucking chickens it's kind of it's kind of sick yeah it is totally sick cuz I'm seeing my chickens that are years old just running around and these fucking chickens get to be two months old and their legs break from the weight of their bodies yeah [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1791.5s)]
*  yeah it's kind of depressing but that's why at least in their short life I try to let them have I let them get us some sunshine and run around and read stories to him at night and all that and that way it's not but so bad that way it doesn't feel like I'm just a like a horrible dictate like a chicken dictator imagine the amount of chickens that get whacked in this country every year is crazy yeah and honestly raising birds in your yard is so much better than so much buying them from Tyson or something like that oh so that's a regular chicken on the left from 1957 and then by the time [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1821.5s)]
*  1978 rolled around we got him pretty fat it kind of looks like it just looks kind of like what happened with all of us from back then until now you know probably no coincidence we're all eating terrible food too but I think there's something going on with their genetics too I think they look at that thing that's crazy look at the size of that butterball yeah that looks like a fucking soccer ball isn't that nuts that's nuts that's a chicken that is fucking insane look at that one sitting there in a ball look at [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1851.5s)]
*  that one that's in a ball look at that that is bananas wow yeah they're still my favorite I've tried so far I've tried I do guinea birds turkeys and we've tried to try to feed different types of chickens and stuff but turkeys overrated turkeys good they're funny oh yeah they eat they're probably overrated but they're really funny in person they're good to eat if you eat them right after you get them out of the oven or if it's gonna be on the sandwich with a bunch of other shit on it otherwise they're dry and boring it's a weird bird it's a bird that like somehow [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1881.5s)]
*  or another it became our holiday bird you know what I mean very strange they make this real guttural noise it's like a it's like a vibration more than a noise but the males they have this like crazy like I can't I don't even know how to describe it but it's like that it's with it's a noise they make internally that you can hear it sounds like it sounds like a UFO it sounds like when you're getting sucked up in the UFO or crazy noise like that yeah oh really but I liked they're like dogs to me I've got a couple of Timmy and Tommy and they [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1911.5s)]
*  hang out on the yard yeah well I did Timmy's now Timmy's in the freezer but we still got we still got Tommy so Tommy's still your friend? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1941.5s)]
*  breakthrough on the birds of domesticated in a gene ah there it is that played a key role came in 2010 with a study of the genomes of eight different populations of present-day chickens from around the world researchers found they all carry two copies of one version of a gene called the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1951.5s)]
*  which apparently set in motion changes that plumped up the birds this dominant version of the gene or allele had swept through all the domesticated chickens regardless of whether they were broilers rather bred for size or strains bred for laying many eggs although the precise function of the gene is not known it regulates metabolism reproduction [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1970.5s)]
*  so probably stimulated chickens to lay more eggs year round so big ass chickens that lay more eggs [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1991.5s)]
*  it started off from a decree from a pope a thousand years ago whoa how did one ban on four legged animals what yeah they got tough and banned meat from four legged animals on fasts oh on fasts which numbered 130 days out of the year damn 130 fasts what were they doing back then [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=1996.5s)]
*  yeah you couldn't eat like you had to fast all of lent which is 40 days that's like the Christmas Easter fast you probably had to do it again around Christmas but when they say fasts but you could eat chicken yeah that's not a fast or fish that's bullshit yeah the lent thing when I was a kid I remember that I remember I don't know I can't fish on Friday I don't think that the Catholic Church I just can't imagine the Catholic Church ever coming out with some kind of decree that just doesn't make total sense though you know for everybody to follow I don't know forever I'm sure it's some kind of [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2017.5s)]
*  I'm sure there's some yeah forever I'm sure there's some reasonable explanation yeah they definitely have it dialed in yeah it's not like churches a thousand years ago would would ever do anything that didn't make a lot of sense so well I think back then what when did they stop being allowed to have wives and shit when did that happen like when did the Catholic Church put a ban like when did they make it so that everybody had to be celibate boy what a stupid idea that was you want to get people come completely disconnected from society and sexually [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2047.5s)]
*  insanely repressed just you give them saltpeter and tell them they can't beat off it became canon law and the 11th century later reinforced and the Council of Trent 1545 so I bet there was something there's 300 400 years of a little slippery times what do you think this episode is brought to you by masa chips did you know that all chips used to be cooked in tallow up until the 90s when big corporations switched to cheap processed seed oils and today [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2077.5s)]
*  seed oils make up 20% of the average Americans daily calories well masa decided to do something about it they created a tasty and delicious tortilla chip with just three ingredients and no seed oils just organic nix tamalized corn sea salt and 100% grass fed beef tallow masa chips is beloved by tens of thousands of customers including me I buy them they're awesome they've been endorsed by leading health and nutrition experts like Ben Greenfield and [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2107.5s)]
*  Gary Brekow who have appeared on this show as well ready to give masa try go to masa chips dot com slash JRE and use the code JRE for 25% off your first order ultimately what is the motive it's all control obviously but just it's crazy to think about all the things that you know the church at one point in time the church was almost like the power structure they were like the government for a long time yeah yeah yeah I mean they had immense power the like the Pope was [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2137.5s)]
*  the decide whether or not armies were gonna be set places yeah nuts yeah and if you look at the Vatican you go oh this is what you guys did just fucking stole everybody's art they have so much art like how'd you get this yeah how convenient how did you get billions of dollars in art I mean it's kind of cool I love the fact that it's there and you can visit it and you should visit it if you've never been to the Vatican it's fucking bananas in a way it's like there's always been somebody trying to use a moral high ground to control other people like now it's [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2167.5s)]
*  the opposite right it's like now it's people now it's like the people opposite of church that are sort of like trying to control people through this moral authority of like this is what's right and like this sort of new society that we have to live in where everything has to be comfortable and nobody's allowed to be offended and we're not and it's like all this that's like the same authoritarian psychology that was in the old it's like this is the moral you have to follow this because it's the moral high ground of you know and you're not allowed to speak it's like it's always somebody trying to control somebody else with this virtuous [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2197.5s)]
*  propaganda that and it yeah it's like I was talking you know my most of the people on my team I say most there's only really four of us now like in my music business but two of them are from Ireland and they were and my tour manager was telling me about like growing up and you know growing up in Dublin when he was younger I guess like back in the 70s or 80s and the like just just the stigma within the church and all the like so much stuff that the church was doing wrong that would get kind of covered up and [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2227.5s)]
*  crushed to the side and it's just it's really crazy when you read into all that like how like how much corruption existed back then you know it's like now it's now it's easy to point to corruption in government and in society and everything else but it's not like the church is more dead now than it is corrupt I'd say but back then it was just like this power hungry thing you know that and that to me that's not real church that's just like I said that's just government or a regime using church as a you know using God as a way to control people but it's a lot different than than what church should be or could be [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2257.5s)]
*  for sure I mean that's it's that's just a function of human beings when they get in power human beings when they get in power they want more power like if you're in the automobile business automobile business and you're making cars you want to make more cars want to make more cars want to sell more cars got to sell more cars if I'm in the power business I want more power I don't want this amount of power I want more power these people trying to take my power away I want extra power the best way to keep them from taking my power away is to get more power and get it so that they can never take my power away you know lock it down make the [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2287.5s)]
*  elections bullshit you know make it like Russia hey Putin won again everybody clap [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2317.5s)]
*  did you have you seen that video that went around recently of I think it was in [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2321.7s)]
*  Romania but there was like an overthrow that happened in a day it was like that [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2326.12s)]
*  it was a it was from back in the 80s it was a I think it was like a it was a [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2330.28s)]
*  dictator that it was over Romania I believe I don't know I'm I'm not on the [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2334.18s)]
*  internet a whole lot anymore thankfully but I remember watching a bit of this [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2339.18s)]
*  video where this is like a Romanian dictator who had he had been in power [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2344.74s)]
*  for like 20 years and had done a lot of oppressive stuff but overall was like [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2348.2999999999997s)]
*  maintaining power and then at some point a police officer or a military official [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2351.74s)]
*  or something shot I think like a like a preacher or a pope or something and the [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2356.2999999999997s)]
*  the the dictator dude took the side of the police and it sort of was like a [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2360.7799999999997s)]
*  cultural shift and basically like he went to give this big speech and all [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2364.9399999999996s)]
*  these people showed up and they had applause playing over loudspeakers but [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2368.7999999999997s)]
*  really the crowd was there to like mob and within like a day they had like [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2372.22s)]
*  taken the whole government over the whole military turned against them it [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2376.2599999999998s)]
*  was a big video that just got uploaded about it like maybe a month ago I think [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2378.8399999999997s)]
*  it was Romania I believe but it was so quick it was like he went from being in [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2382.02s)]
*  this position of power and like ruling over everything and having just just [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2386.56s)]
*  extreme wealth and the whole military at his disposal to to everyone turning on [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2389.5s)]
*  him and he was publicly executed I think the day after that speech but that was [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2394.7s)]
*  just something I watched here we go yeah executing a dictator open wounds of [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2398.82s)]
*  Romania's Christmas Revolution well they did it on Christmas damn damn wow and [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2403.5s)]
*  there's a video on this yeah there's a video on YouTube that that somebody sent [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2411.9s)]
*  me that I was watching through it was just it just showed out it just showed [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2416.02s)]
*  though going back to like if enough people have their minds made the same [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2419.3s)]
*  much do anything but I believe it was what it was within like a two-day period [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2424.06s)]
*  that all this happened he went from being empowered of being publicly [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2430.1s)]
*  executed and they held up elections afterwards and like and I don't know all [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2433.14s)]
*  the history of it I know very little but it's just something that seemed really [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2437.46s)]
*  interesting to me that I've never I was never taught this in school or anything [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2440.1s)]
*  I know that but of course I didn't pay a whole lot of attention while I was there [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2443.1s)]
*  either so maybe I maybe I did get taught I don't know there's been so much war in [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2446.14s)]
*  that part of the world man for so long for so long it's like baked into the [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2449.98s)]
*  ground crazy shit that's going on in Ukraine right now have you seen that [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2454.78s)]
*  they they're flying these drones that you can't jam and the way they are they [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2459.42s)]
*  have like miles of fiber optic cable attached to them yeah this is so crazy [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2464.22s)]
*  they're like fishing like fishing with a drone and now birds are making like [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2468.78s)]
*  nests and as fiber optic stuff they're picking it up like oh it's perfect make [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2473.7400000000002s)]
*  a little mess with this shit see how they got those drones in for the attack [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2477.86s)]
*  on the planes recently what did they do they drove them in in trucks right yeah [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2482.1s)]
*  that they were like I don't know what buried is the right word but they were [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2486.46s)]
*  like secretly in the trucks and then like they all came out at once or [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2489.58s)]
*  something yeah so opened up of these like log cabins or something they all [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2493.2200000000003s)]
*  came out and they all went out attacked all the planes there were sheds loaded [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2497.06s)]
*  on the trucks well stuck around the pretty fucking ingenious man and they [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2500.54s)]
*  said it took like a year and a half to come up with this plan this will change [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2504.82s)]
*  war forever forever though I guess I mean artificial intelligence will too [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2508.94s)]
*  I'm reading a book about it right now a fiction book one of the gray man books [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2512.94s)]
*  that is specifically about using autonomous weapons it's the Chaos Agent [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2519.06s)]
*  by Mark Graney it's uh it's about a guy who's this billionaire who develops [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2527.78s)]
*  this autonomous weapons weapons program but they're doing that they're doing [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2535.26s)]
*  that right now and we don't know like how advanced China stuff is like but we [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2541.0600000000004s)]
*  know their drones are insanely advanced like their drone shows that they put on [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2545.5800000000004s)]
*  they they just put on another one recently like the largest ever drone [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2549.7000000000003s)]
*  show and you watch these coordinated things in the sky that are creating [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2553.66s)]
*  images you know like that 100% could be a weapon like that thinking you can get [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2558.06s)]
*  that thing to be so precise they coordinate together all you have to do [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2562.7s)]
*  is like put a suicide drone put like three of this thing look at these things [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2566.5s)]
*  bro these are drones and that's is this I mean that is fucking bananas look at [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2570.7799999999997s)]
*  that I mean it's crazy I've heard you know this is all just generalization [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2578.46s)]
*  stuff but I've definitely I've heard people make pretty compelling arguments [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2585.7400000000002s)]
*  about like you know all these sort of like prophetic visions of the end of [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2589.2200000000003s)]

*  that could be I don't know I just I I see a time coming very soon where the [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2596.86s)]
*  word warfare is conducted with these drones and also with like probably [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2602.62s)]
*  like you see they've got Tesla bots and other variants of that that are able to [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2607.42s)]
*  catch tennis balls and organize groceries and these things are all fed [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2610.5s)]

*  it will just be the thing we won't it it won't even be China's AI anymore it [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2631.7400000000002s)]

*  technology it's pitiful you know just like how hard it is to walk around [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2772.3s)]
*  without a phone you know yeah we're integrated even even with when I had [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2776.14s)]
*  periods of time where I knew I had months off and I would always at least I [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2780.58s)]
*  got to the point where I I weaned myself down to like this I bought a flip phone [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2785.1s)]
*  from Walmart that still runs on over Verizon sim but that's that's what I [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2788.98s)]
*  carry and two or three people knew mine but even then I always felt like I at [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2793.5s)]
*  least had to have a flip phone on me in case like what happens if you're out in [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2796.18s)]
*  the woods and break your leg or I don't know where like but they are now a part [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2799.06s)]
*  like those phones are a part of us we don't go anywhere without them we feel [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2802.38s)]
*  naked no phone we feel vulnerable without them so I know you really do [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2805.46s)]
*  like if you go for a quick walk without a phone like oh my god so when the time [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2809.46s)]
*  comes when it's like will there if there even is a definitive time but it's like [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2813.18s)]
*  when we have to choose between integrating with AI and not most people [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2817.5s)]
*  are gonna do it yeah those people will just immediately submit and be a part of [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2820.34s)]
*  it and be maybe even excited to be a part of it it probably won't be a [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2824.1s)]
*  decision that you're allowed to make it's probably something that's gonna be [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2827.3s)]
*  if you want to function in society you have to integrate like we talked about [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2831.7400000000002s)]
*  in that text about how it feels like we're in an alternate dimension and it [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2834.74s)]
*  seems like there's these like things coming you know it's like it does it [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2837.74s)]
*  does it also it is just because things happen so fast and chaotic that we [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2840.9799999999996s)]
*  can't really keep up with anything one day the submarine collapses and the next [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2844.4599999999996s)]
*  day this other crazy thing happens and then you know I don't know it's just [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2848.18s)]
*  like it's so hard to keep up with what anything of what's really going on I [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2851.2599999999998s)]
*  think the problem is that we have to start having people gather together [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2854.5s)]
*  again and hang out and not just make all of our hangouts digital because the [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2858.8199999999997s)]
*  systems like you said there's bots and algorithms and marketing approaches and [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2862.74s)]
*  psychology that's just deeply rooted that goes into like just the way we [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2867.02s)]
*  fundamentally communicate now as societies and just globally like we all [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2870.72s)]
*  just talk on I mean gosh I like I've used this example before somewhere [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2874.8199999999997s)]
*  talking but it's like I think about back when I was in high school like my high [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2878.2999999999997s)]
*  school girlfriend you know we would have some trivial argument about something [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2881.74s)]
*  there was no way that me and her were gonna text and figure out how to fix [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2884.9799999999996s)]
*  that and now you know like and that was a high school relationship like that was [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2887.98s)]
*  over something stupid it's like real-world problems you can't fix just [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2893.14s)]
*  texting and I don't think we can fix all this shit on X and Facebook and all that [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2896.5s)]
*  I think it's like it's I think people just have people are we're almost to the [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2900.34s)]
*  point now where we prefer socializing on the internet because it's almost like [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2905.58s)]
*  our minds have become more adapted to think that way but it's but it's we're [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2909.34s)]
*  here we're in this digital world chasing and emulating all of the things that [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2912.98s)]
*  we're that are that we have this void from from not having in real life like I [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2917.3s)]
*  don't know it's it makes it very complicated to fix anything when we're [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2921.82s)]
*  the only way that we can we have this amazing intricate English language where [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2926.1800000000003s)]
*  all these words can mean all these different things and it's so easy to put [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2930.3s)]
*  everybody together in a digital space with AI and bots and manipulation and [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2932.78s)]
*  algorithms and big companies and how do you fix all that in that space it's just [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2936.7400000000002s)]
*  like it's you'll never it's like and how we're just in a house of mirrors you [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2941.26s)]
*  know yeah you're supposed to not engage that's what people need to stop doing [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2944.26s)]
*  but the problem is the consequences of the actions of the rest of the world do [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2949.46s)]
*  affect you if they're big and so you worry about the big ones so you pay [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2954.5400000000004s)]
*  attention so you got to pay attention to the bad news of 8 billion people which [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2958.6200000000003s)]
*  is just unsustainable and it's also this ability to interact or not interact as [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2963.0200000000004s)]
*  you choose all throughout the day like you don't have to be invested in a [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2968.3s)]
*  conversation and you ask me about something and I start to answer I just [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2972.54s)]

*  like so many posts something somebody have a response an hour later and nobody [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2980.86s)]
*  cares it's like I guess he was busy you know it's normal because you're engaging [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2983.86s)]
*  and not engaged it's very unhuman all of it is unhuman and it's all like constant [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2987.22s)]
*  even if you think you're immune to it there's this constant input of other [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2992.94s)]
*  people's thoughts into your own that makes you foggy it gives you like I was [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=2996.86s)]

*  about though you know like it's sort of sort of but from my perspective I was [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3673.3399999999997s)]
*  just one piece in this thing that happened yeah and you know that's why I [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3677.5s)]
*  always have my friend Adam Curry on who's the original he's the pod father [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3682.14s)]
*  without him there would be none of this he figured out a way to do this and you [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3686.42s)]
*  know and then also Anthony Kumia from Opie and Anthony and Tom Green those [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3691.62s)]
*  those are my number one influences and then Adam Corolla already had a podcast [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3695.7400000000002s)]
*  when I started I was like oh Adam went from radio to the internet maybe I could [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3701.3s)]
*  do that I remember going to his place and that's pretty cool it's back when we [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3706.14s)]
*  were doing it on a little laptop like wow Adam has a real studio he's got [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3709.66s)]
*  employees and shit and then you know we just kept doing it just kept doing it [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3713.62s)]
*  you know and then eventually it was webcams okay now it's not just the [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3718.8199999999997s)]
*  laptop camera it's actual webcams okay now maybe we should get like real [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3722.02s)]
*  cameras okay let's get real cameras and then like maybe we should get a fucking [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3725.98s)]
*  studio so we tried it at the ice house for a little bit like maybe I should get [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3729.06s)]
*  another place then we got another place I'm like I think I need a warehouse and [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3731.98s)]
*  then like I think I need armed security [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3735.06s)]
*  fucking special ops guys around me all the time and then it just kept going man [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3739.06s)]
*  I remember the moment I've talked about this before but I didn't understand what [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3745.18s)]
*  was happening until one day I was on stage in Chicago and I think this is [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3748.78s)]
*  2012 so I think I think it was around then so the podcast was only three years [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3753.62s)]
*  old and I didn't realize how many people watched it or listened a lot of it was [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3759.38s)]
*  listening at the time because I wasn't I don't look at the numbers I just kind [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3764.58s)]
*  of key I feel like all that's bad for you you know reading the comments look [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3769.98s)]
*  at the numbers I just like do what you do that's why I do it exactly the same [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3773.46s)]
*  way I have a bunch of people on there no one has ever heard of you know and then [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3776.66s)]
*  a few bonos and stuff you know every now and then I'll have Russell Crowe on [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3779.98s)]
*  something crazy Dennis Quaid's here yeah you're Mel Gibson one yeah he's the [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3783.46s)]
*  best but but I was on stage in Chicago and I was telling the story about the [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3788.9s)]
*  podcast I go how many guys listen to the podcast anyway yeah I was like [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3793.22s)]
*  three thousand seven hundred people in this place and they were all screaming [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3797.9399999999996s)]
*  I went whoa yeah that's when I realized like at that moment I was like holy shit [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3800.8999999999996s)]
*  how big is this thing gonna get and this is another funny thing when I went over [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3807.7799999999997s)]
*  the Spotify I was trying to get ten percent less famous that was my goal my [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3812.18s)]
*  goal was to fade away my goal was like if somebody has to pay me you have to go [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3816.4199999999996s)]
*  to this app to get it all the people that are getting at the other apps are [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3821.18s)]
*  probably stop listening yeah like this would be great I'll get all the money [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3823.7799999999997s)]
*  and I'll just fucking drift into this place where it's only like the hardcore [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3826.18s)]
*  fans that make the trek over to Spotify and then this fucking COVID thing [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3830.06s)]
*  happened remember the beginning of the podcast we lost 50% of our views and [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3834.4199999999996s)]
*  Jamie was in a hot panic yeah that's exactly what I meant earlier about not [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3838.4199999999996s)]
*  putting a lot of songs out there's like a there's some cool place where you can [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3846.2599999999998s)]
*  be where you're where you have your real fans and you're having fun but [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3849.74s)]
*  you're not into all the sensationalism all the crap you know like you can avoid [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3853.3799999999997s)]
*  all that you're a real guy you're a real dude and I think one of the ways that [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3857.3399999999997s)]
*  the world has prepared you for this is that you've lived a normal life for a [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3860.8599999999997s)]
*  long time you know a normal life with no live performances no notoriety no fame [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3866.2999999999997s)]
*  no nothing you developed like a real like when people want to hear working [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3871.4199999999996s)]
*  band songs you fucking know Bruce Springsteen isn't a working man do you [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3876.14s)]
*  know I'm saying like he probably was never really a working man he was never [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3881.58s)]
*  working on the docks you know what I mean he was never really a guy grinding [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3885.5s)]
*  it out he became famous pretty fucking young you know they Bruce Springsteen in [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3889.58s)]
*  the East Street band they got hot early like they're great don't get me wrong I [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3895.22s)]
*  mean especially as early as born to run fuck he's got some jams dude he's got [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3900.44s)]
*  some great songs you know brilliant disguise oh fucking love that song but [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3905.58s)]
*  you're a real working man like you were a real working man when you made Richmond [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3911.66s)]
*  North of Richmond like that is real and you can't fake that and people want that [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3918.98s)]
*  they want a fucking trucker hat they want ripped jeans they don't want like [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3923.8199999999997s)]
*  ripped jeans that are ripped from work you know what I mean they don't like real [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3927.1s)]
*  oil stains on your knees because you're fixing your own car you know like that's [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3930.58s)]
*  what people want in this world they want authenticity and it's possible to [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3935.02s)]
*  maintain authenticity regardless of how big you get it is possible and I think [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3940.14s)]
*  you can do it I think you can do it because you got here later in life you [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3943.82s)]
*  got here and lived a real life and then you made it into magical fantasy land [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3947.62s)]
*  where we all live yeah well the thing that I've gotten the most from you like [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3953.18s)]
*  I see I don't look at my streaming numbers or anything either that's what I [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3957.04s)]
*  mean like when I finally did go back and look at Spotify like a after a year a [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3959.54s)]
*  half later it's just like oh my god like I'm this is still the thing you know but [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3964.78s)]
*  uh so I agree with you there I don't look at the numbers I I do I do catch [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3969.02s)]
*  myself reading a lot of the comments but only because a lot of them are important [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3973.58s)]
*  and they I think some of the stories in them are important for me to I don't I [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3976.42s)]
*  don't want to completely isolate myself from that and like I said I also really [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3979.94s)]
*  like some of the negative ones too I think and they're negative ones are a [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3982.9s)]
*  lot less now than they used to be it was just really early on people didn't [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3985.5s)]
*  understand how everything happened and I really didn't understand it either [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3988.44s)]
*  that's why it's like whatever you know but moving forward now yeah I've got a [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3991.1s)]
*  good like core team of people I've got Draven from Radio WV I've got two or [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=3996.34s)]
*  three people on staff I don't have a management company or a publicist you [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4000.58s)]
*  know that's the key I'm keeping it real real low well I mean it's amazed me when [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4004.34s)]
*  I came here for the first time and saw the staff you have and then like meeting [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4009.38s)]
*  Lex you know Lex does all of it he even turns his own cameras on and so there's [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4012.7000000000003s)]
*  only Lex in the whole place it's like gosh I don't need all these it's like [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4016.14s)]
*  a lot of those positions and jobs and services that musicians use I think they [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4020.62s)]
*  don't realize that they don't even need they just are like oh that's how it is [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4024.9s)]
*  in music that's what I want to change I want to yeah I don't know exactly [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4027.7s)]
*  eliminates the executive influence it eliminates the corporate mindset it [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4032.1s)]
*  eliminates that because there's always going to be a person that wants you to [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4036.66s)]
*  make a decision that's better for you financially whereas like your instincts [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4039.18s)]
*  are guiding you towards this artistic decision yeah and anytime those people [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4042.94s)]
*  get in the mix they fuck everything up I'll give you a great example it's like [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4047.62s)]
*  the only it's the only like call out on here that's negative that I'll say it all [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4051.06s)]
*  is that just to show like how stuck in the mud the industry is and how how much [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4054.7s)]
*  I think it's gonna change in the near future is leading up to this scornful [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4061.42s)]
*  release me and Draven had went back and found about 30 or 40 people who just [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4065.42s)]
*  without us even knowing who they were made the Richmond reaction videos and [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4071.02s)]
*  they were a big part of the push of it especially long-term you know like [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4075.06s)]
*  people on tik-tok and stuff that had made these videos and so I I don't have [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4078.46s)]
*  I own a hundred percent of my publishing you know all the music's mine thankfully [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4083.5s)]
*  I have my own label technically that collects the money but you have to use a [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4087.38s)]
*  publishing administration deal in order to collect money like overseas I don't [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4090.54s)]
*  know if you're familiar if it's the same in comedy but like yeah most any [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4094.46s)]
*  musician whether you're independent or you're with somebody you have to have [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4099.0199999999995s)]
*  some kind of pub admin and it's a basically somebody that goes and helps [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4101.54s)]
*  you collect publishing money from overs basically mostly from overseas is the [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4104.34s)]
*  way I understand like all these obscure places that money exists so Warner [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4108.22s)]
*  Chapel does it for me for nine percent right so they go collect all the stuff [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4112.54s)]
*  they keep nine percent of it they're the same to me as if I had a commercial [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4116.42s)]
*  landscaping company managing a property for me so all I asked them to do was hey [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4119.9400000000005s)]
*  Warner Chapel this six foot square of grass where all these reaction videos [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4124.42s)]
*  exist just please whitelist these people so they don't get copyrighted I want them [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4128.58s)]
*  to actually make the money they make on the scornful reaction videos you know [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4132.26s)]
*  like I don't I don't feel right if they're gonna go and make a scornful [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4135.58s)]
*  woman reaction video or or play drums over it or whatever I don't want to take [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4139.5s)]
*  50% of what you know what I mean just don't copy just whitelist them and it [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4143.38s)]
*  should have been okay great good idea you know instead they just said we can't [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4147.74s)]
*  do that but it's for your protection so because they wanted the money so and I [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4152.46s)]
*  get a percentage and I how do they how do they get well they get they they take [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4157.58s)]
*  nine percent off of what I get they don't want but I tried to explain to them well [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4161.74s)]
*  no like in the business sense I even counter argued them and I was like well [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4165.38s)]
*  let's think about it in the business sense this little bit of money right [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4170.34s)]
*  that you're not going to collect off these reaction videos will generate who [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4173.78s)]
*  knows how much traffic to the music which is worth the money you really want [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4177.0199999999995s)]
*  and it shouldn't matter anyway it's not there it's not their shit to decide on [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4180.42s)]
*  it's mine they're just it's it's the same thing as if I hired a guy to cut [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4183.74s)]
*  the grass at my commercial property and said don't cut the six foot square and [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4186.74s)]
*  they're like no we're cutting it we're cutting all the grass and it's for your [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4190.42s)]
*  so I had to get my attorney involved and spend like four grand and they [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4193.54s)]
*  whitelisted them for 30 days and so I'm like okay like that's why that's why all [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4197.86s)]
*  of you industry people are like so you know it's like that's why this is [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4202.22s)]
*  happening that's why it's like I don't know just they don't care at all about [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4205.62s)]
*  the little guy or the people who are like doing all the work they just I just [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4210.34s)]
*  picture all these like stinky librarian type old people sitting around a table [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4215.22s)]
*  and you know they can make all this money and make all these horrible [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4220.18s)]
*  decisions and pour all these millions of dollars into songs that don't work and [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4222.54s)]
*  it doesn't matter because it's just like it it's not there they don't care [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4225.74s)]
*  they're getting their big salary and yeah so so yeah it's just even even in [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4228.66s)]
*  the lid even in the most minuscule relationships I've had in Nashville I [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4234.58s)]
*  get resistance and pushback and like it's I don't know like why wouldn't they [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4237.86s)]
*  want me to whitelist those 30 people it's just a little stupid stuff like [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4241.78s)]
*  that that I've constantly dealt with so I've just decided now like I don't need [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4244.94s)]
*  I just don't want to do anything in the music like I don't even need to be in the [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4247.78s)]
*  music business like in that sense you know I'm just I write my songs I record [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4250.86s)]
*  them I go do my shows and have fun but I don't even need to follow any of the [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4254.86s)]
*  model of what of what like a traditional musician artist person would have done [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4258.54s)]
*  you definitely don't need ten years ago you know I don't need to do it that way [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4262.54s)]
*  it's not necessary and you you have the right mindset is that all those reaction [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4265.9s)]
*  videos just get more people to listen to your music it's that's fact but those [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4270.94s)]
*  real those people were like real fans who went and did it not because they were [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4274.62s)]
*  trying to get traffic or money or whatever they just like liked it and [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4278.94s)]
*  wanted to push it and so the least I can do is not take 50% of their stuff and [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4282.86s)]
*  like it just but isn't that crazy that it's like there's nobody's ever done [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4288.26s)]
*  that I guess like before they were just acting like that was just the craziest [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4292.5s)]
*  thing in the world so I ended up releasing this scornful song through a [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4295.58s)]
*  company called sound on which is like the music distribution side of tik-tok [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4299.62s)]
*  which seems like something I would never want to do but they give me the [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4304.18s)]
*  flexibility to go and like and do all that they don't care because they're not [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4309.3s)]
*  music industry people they're just social media people so I uploaded it [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4312.98s)]
*  through them basically so I'm still I own all 100% of the rights it's all my [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4316.94s)]
*  stuff I don't have any deals or records or labels or anything but they push it [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4320.9s)]
*  to the streaming services for me and they do all the stuff so that way I'm [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4324.46s)]
*  not even having to use a music company to push my music I can kind of just like [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4327.7s)]
*  not even be there at all you know like not even being in Nashville at all [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4331.62s)]
*  that's the goal is just to get and so now that I've got data from you know [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4335.54s)]
*  since Richmond basically and have learned a lot my goal long term is I want [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4340.3s)]
*  I'm gonna always put new music out and write stuff and you know but it's gonna [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4346.099999999999s)]
*  come in spurts and there'll be times where people won't see a lot of me but [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4349.78s)]
*  I'm gonna be in the background with other people like I want to help I want [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4352.5s)]
*  I find these people on tik-tok that have like a hundred followers but I know that [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4356.12s)]
*  they've got what it takes and get with like Draven and some of these other [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4359.2s)]
*  people I've met and like help them write some really good songs and record them [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4361.92s)]
*  and put them out and push them and just like I would love to plant like 10 or [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4364.76s)]
*  15 people into music like give them everything I can give them to to push [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4368.32s)]
*  them forward and make like that way it doesn't feel like it I'm the guy in the [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4372.68s)]
*  spotlight trying to like I feel like I'm just in a I feel like I'm like the most [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4376.44s)]
*  I don't know these companies have got like all these employees and all this [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4380.0s)]
*  money and all this backing and it's literally like four or five of us taking [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4383.56s)]
*  them it just I don't know to me I just think I I think there's strength in [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4386.72s)]
*  numbers if I could help more artists push forward and like help them break [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4390.76s)]
*  that cycle too that it would just it would be like a multiplication factor on [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4394.8s)]
*  this whole thing that's kind of what that's gonna be kind of my next thing I [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4398.160000000001s)]
*  get into is is helping produce music and doing festivals and like starting a [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4402.240000000001s)]
*  label basically kind of sort of that's fucking awesome but a non-predatory one [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4407.92s)]
*  like even even when Draven put somebody on Radio WV if they get 30,000 views [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4411.92s)]
*  there's already people trying to sign them like they just want control of every [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4416.4800000000005s)]
*  new thing that's you know that's what they were trying to do to you right off [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4420.36s)]
*  the bat oh it's terrifying too to not do it it just felt like I was just it felt [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4423.96s)]
*  like I was just everything it was everything in me felt wrong doing it you [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4428.84s)]
*  know but I just decided that I didn't care about it and that it I just you [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4432.4400000000005s)]
*  know I remember being very adamant at the beginning that every decision [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4436.28s)]
*  moving forward was based off the fact that I wasn't scared to go back to my [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4440.0s)]
*  old job if I had to because I'd rather go back to my old job and be me than go [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4443.4s)]
*  to Republic but just be Republic's little bitch you know I have to do [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4447.48s)]
*  everything they want and say everything like and a lot of seeing where all your [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4450.8s)]
*  profits go and realizing that you got hoodwinked into these deals because [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4453.88s)]
*  these deals when they give you a big chunk of money you got to pay that money [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4458.68s)]
*  back yeah that's all just in advance if I had went with a label I would have been [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4461.32s)]
*  a lot bigger though because they would have made me push 30 songs out a year [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4465.88s)]
*  and they would have put all this marketing money into and they would have [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4469.2s)]
*  kind of inflated me into this big fake like every other country superstar and [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4472.48s)]
*  so it feels a lot better just kind of being a little little scaled back a [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4476.72s)]
*  little smaller but yeah collecting 100% of my money and then also just knowing [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4481.0s)]
*  that I don't have a boss anymore other than you know than the man upstairs like [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4484.639999999999s)]
*  I don't gosh dude I mean like imagine how you know I've heard stories from [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4488.84s)]
*  bands and stuff now that have told me that they've went and had to record [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4493.92s)]
*  music like under a label contract and really didn't like the way the album [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4496.32s)]
*  turned out but still had to release it anyway like oh my gosh that would just [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4499.5599999999995s)]
*  make me to have to put music out that I didn't think was good and then you know [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4503.08s)]
*  even oh did and then you get behind it yeah yeah you don't want other people [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4506.84s)]
*  especially financial people to ever be involved in your art ever even if they're [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4512.08s)]
*  good people like now we can work on a beneficial deal for both people no no [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4517.84s)]
*  it's not gonna be beneficial for you it's gonna influence you and it's gonna [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4521.4s)]
*  turn you in one way or another that's not the way you would have originally [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4525.36s)]
*  gone on your own and the reason there's so much money in music is because music [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4528.48s)]
*  such a big part of us as human beings and it's like it's so funny the first [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4531.48s)]
*  thing they do when they sign somebody is like try to rip their identity away and [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4534.88s)]
*  it's like they it's like the labels don't understand that it's the identity [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4538.92s)]
*  of the person that put them in the position they're in in the first place [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4542.04s)]
*  it's like you said the relatability of it you know well there's also people [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4544.759999999999s)]
*  have this instinct to try to influence people so there's one of things that [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4548.28s)]
*  executives do in the beginning when someone's just starting they want you [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4551.96s)]
*  know what you should do you should get a crew cut I think you'd look great with [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4554.96s)]
*  a crew cut and then like the crew cut was my idea you know something about [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4558.4800000000005s)]
*  Oliver's crew cut everybody loves that crew cut yeah it's just like he doesn't [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4561.96s)]
*  give a fuck about his hair that was my idea yeah you know there's a little of [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4564.96s)]
*  that because like people are easily influenced because like in the beginning [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4568.32s)]
*  you're not sure like I can't even believe I got signed like am I gonna be [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4570.96s)]
*  a star these people all here for me you know and they'll fucking get in there [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=4574.44s)]

*  human history and this is a struggle and it is a battle but I think we can [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5222.34s)]
*  come out of this on the other side we all realize that we're being played [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5226.34s)]
*  against each other and that's where it's important you know when you're paying [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5229.9400000000005s)]
*  people to protest you're leaving pallets of bricks around and you're organizing [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5233.7s)]
*  the whole thing and you're shipping people in on buses and you're making [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5237.5s)]
*  sure that all the people show up at a certain amount of time they're all [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5240.46s)]
*  compensated and you give them water and snacks like we got to realize what's [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5243.34s)]

*  that I thought was very promising is that he wants to make an executive order [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5257.74s)]

*  exempt from all this stuff this is my feeling like if you got here and you're [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5271.54s)]
*  you've integrated into our society yeah maybe you shouldn't have snuck in but [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5276.18s)]

*  just preyed upon by people that will take advantage of the fact [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5287.9400000000005s)]
*  that they're undocumented and not pay them what they're legally supposed to [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5291.900000000001s)]
*  pay them and not give them benefits if they're legally supposed to have [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5294.780000000001s)]
*  benefits and they can't say anything because they're worried that [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5297.66s)]
*  immigration is gonna get called on them so these people are in this constant [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5300.18s)]
*  state of anxiety and then they hear about the ICE raids like at Home Depot [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5303.82s)]

*  nice but why why like gang members yes criminals yes this why why like I think [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5349.74s)]
*  as crazy as it sounds the only way to do this and look like you have a heart [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5357.86s)]
*  is evaluate people on a case-by-case basis like there's good people it's good [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5362.98s)]
*  people it's also so complicated because it goes back for so long and the idea [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5368.62s)]
*  the thing now is that there's two very polarizing opinions of what America even [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5372.46s)]
*  is a represents or what job it's supposed to serve to the world so like [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5375.82s)]
*  you know in some yeah sure there like any for any country to exist it has to [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5379.259999999999s)]
*  have there has to be it's something there that identifies what it is as a [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5383.94s)]
*  country and you have and like there's like yeah like it just seems like [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5387.06s)]
*  without citizenship or without some definitive thing of who's a citizen or [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5389.9400000000005s)]
*  not it's like then it's not even a country is like and in most every [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5394.3s)]
*  country has some like the idea of there not being no immigration laws for a [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5397.700000000001s)]
*  country means that it's no longer a country but also think it's like the [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5401.46s)]
*  the opposite side of that too is like America's always in theory even though [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5405.34s)]
*  it's always been ran by these there's always been these corrupt people [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5411.280000000001s)]
*  involved in it in theory you know America was supposed was started as sort [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5414.18s)]
*  of this thing that was like that can maybe be like like a sanctuary that like [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5418.42s)]
*  that like doesn't allow the doesn't allow monarchies and dictators and [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5424.42s)]
*  horrible things you know like as bad as America maybe has been in certain cases [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5429.06s)]
*  like the fact that when when Japan lost they didn't just go and take it over and [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5433.9400000000005s)]
*  call it another part of America like they went and tried to rebuild like in [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5439.18s)]
*  theory America is supposed to be this vein that exists of you know it's it's [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5443.219999999999s)]
*  it's originate its origination is from people who wanted to get away from [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5447.9s)]
*  monarchies and dictators and of course like it's so easy to pick on the [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5451.58s)]
*  founding fathers and all their faults and the crazy things they did but it was [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5455.0199999999995s)]
*  centuries ago in a different culture and they probably were all maniacs you'd [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5457.74s)]
*  have to be a maniac to to go up against the world's biggest empire and take it [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5461.34s)]
*  on you know like musket with a fucking yeah like you'd have to be you have to [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5465.9s)]
*  be crazy and of course they had personality flaws but they were the [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5470.42s)]
*  reality is is that here's the thing that sucks is like and it goes both ways [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5473.62s)]
*  there's a lot of things about people on the left that people on the right don't [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5476.62s)]
*  realize that they have in common and it's the same way with this like I it [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5480.46s)]
*  breaks my heart when people just totally trash the founding fathers not because [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5484.1s)]
*  they were these morally they took horrendous shits too I'm sure probably [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5487.14s)]
*  not as bad as Beyonce but pretty close and you know the fact like of course [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5490.42s)]
*  they were bad people they were all bad we're humans we're flawed inherently [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5494.02s)]
*  even the best of us even the ones who act like we're the best and the most like [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5497.42s)]
*  it we're all screwed up we all have our problems and our faults and stuff but [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5501.14s)]
*  the fact that they were willing to like go somewhere to another land with all [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5503.82s)]
*  these with all this crazy stuff and then take on the you know the world's biggest [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5507.58s)]
*  empire at that time just so they could be able to do it they you know religious [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5510.5s)]
*  freedom it's like the they didn't want religious religious freedom because they [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5515.3s)]
*  were not even necessarily because they wanted to go to church I always thought [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5518.54s)]
*  it was like it's so weird that they they were fighting for religion but it wasn't [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5521.9400000000005s)]
*  they were fighting for religion they were fighting for the mandate of religion [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5525.5s)]
*  for the they were they were tired of the church and like I know it's not [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5528.58s)]
*  considered the church anymore but there is still a church that dominates us and [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5532.7s)]
*  tries to control us now and that now unfortunately now the church is just [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5536.78s)]
*  sort of this weird thing but it's the it's a zebra mentality you know among [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5540.02s)]
*  politicians it's like it goes back to that I think it's Jordan Peterson that [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5544.14s)]
*  talks about the zebras and how they'll do a study on zebras and though it's in [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5547.14s)]
*  the maps of meaning book I believe and they'll mark one read to study it and [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5550.54s)]
*  then the predators take that zebra down because the zebra's stripes aren't [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5554.179999999999s)]
*  camouflaged to their surroundings they're camouflaged to each other so [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5558.099999999999s)]
*  they're not easily identifiable and so four or five lions can't take one zebra [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5560.86s)]
*  down if they all look the same and in politics I believe that's what's [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5564.38s)]
*  happened especially on the left you know I I had people in Nashville quit working [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5567.44s)]
*  with me because I talked about this when I was at the Ryman but we had this [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5572.86s)]
*  this this dancing this chick that plays the fiddle and she does like flat [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5577.46s)]
*  dancing and stuff named Hillary Klug who lives in Nashville and we had her [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5583.1s)]
*  come to the Ryman to do this show with us and it was on a last-minute thing and [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5586.58s)]
*  I'm about to introduce her and I tell the crowd I'm like hey you know I said I [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5590.18s)]
*  got Hillary about to come out and I was like but it's not don't worry it's not [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5594.620000000001s)]
*  that Hillary and just made it just made a joke about it well I just somebody [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5597.900000000001s)]
*  said something in the crowd that was and I don't know I just interact and I just [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5602.5s)]
*  say what comes to mind I don't care you know I don't worry about all that stuff [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5606.1s)]
*  and what people might think I just try to say what I feel but I was like you [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5609.06s)]
*  know isn't it crazy that somebody like Hillary who not that long ago I can [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5612.54s)]
*  remember vividly and as a child or in teenage years like being completely [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5615.62s)]
*  against the idea of even having two people of the same gender be married [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5618.78s)]
*  like she was as against gay marriage as like any any person on the far right is [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5622.82s)]
*  now you know and that was that was in my childhood or early teen and I said and [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5628.78s)]
*  now the fact that now that it's okay for kids to become transgender and go [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5632.18s)]
*  through like what Michael did that's to me is just it just shows that it's all [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5635.78s)]
*  of those people really have any real like opinions about any of this stuff [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5641.14s)]
*  it's all about what'll sell you know like again I said this at the Ryman I [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5644.58s)]
*  said this at the Ryman and so I had my I had my management company that I was [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5647.42s)]
*  using then dropped me and a bunch of other people without even telling me [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5653.26s)]
*  they just emailed my attorney and said they couldn't work with me anymore they [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5655.700000000001s)]
*  were that mad about that which tells you how far off the deep end but anyways [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5658.820000000001s)]
*  just well everything you're saying but but you're exactly you're exactly right [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5663.9800000000005s)]
*  with all that it's just it's difficult to convey that to people because there's [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5668.3s)]
*  so many emotions involved but at the end of the day it's like I don't see a whole [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5672.900000000001s)]
*  lot of difference in people on the left and the right anymore I think we're all [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5677.820000000001s)]
*  just like like you said we all we all are trying to just effectively [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5680.820000000001s)]
*  accomplish the same thing just in different ways and it's really easy to [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5684.7s)]
*  get angry at somebody that's on the same level as you than somebody that you [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5688.9400000000005s)]
*  don't even know exists which is like with these private equity companies and [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5692.06s)]

*  what's happened is is going back to the zebra thing what I think has happened [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5699.46s)]
*  it's like especially in politics the reason why Hillary Clinton can be [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5702.34s)]
*  against gay marriage and then for transgender kids in my in a very short [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5706.22s)]

*  just alike because as soon as one of them looks a little bit different you [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5717.02s)]
*  know like Tulsi Gabbard or whatever I don't know name there's plenty [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5721.1s)]

*  that's like you know trying to be a Democrat and and upholding most of what [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5728.780000000001s)]
*  the Democratic Party would have wanted her to uphold up until very recently but [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5734.06s)]
*  because she didn't rearrange her stripes it's like you're dead but there's a [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5737.5s)]
*  whole bunch of more like her too that that aren't even in politics anymore but [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5740.660000000001s)]

*  I don't know like you just don't really know you don't really know you're just [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5766.82s)]
*  you have to see what you see and you have to take it in and just hope that [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5769.7s)]
*  you have that somehow you have the discernment to know what's true or not [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5773.58s)]
*  but you really just don't I mean even with me man so much crazy stuff that gets [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5776.46s)]
*  said and done and I just don't even when things come out about me that aren't [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5779.7s)]
*  true I just don't even reply or acknowledge him anymore I just let him [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5785.1s)]
*  exist in their own little space and be part of it and I've just decided that [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5787.94s)]
*  again we're just all in that we're just in this crazy thing where all this stuff [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5790.78s)]
*  happens and it's just I don't know you can't you can't promise so many people [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5794.5s)]
*  that don't do that there's they're not aware of how much influence is being [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5798.5s)]
*  peddled on to them how much how much their mind and their opinion is being [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5801.98s)]
*  affected by this nonsense on social media by bots and by all these different [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5806.099999999999s)]
*  things well you said about the zebras and the stripes so fucking perfect one [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5810.86s)]
*  of my favorite clips is Hillary Clinton when she was running I think it was 2012 [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5814.74s)]
*  it might have been when did she for he first became president 2008 right Obama [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5822.98s)]
*  it might have been 2008 but she was running and she was more MAGA than MAGA [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5829.94s)]
*  she was talking about the border and about people coming over here if you [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5835.259999999999s)]
*  want to stay you get a stiff fine and if you've done anything illegal you get [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5839.7s)]
*  exported no questions asked and listen to this give me this full volume from [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5843.42s)]
*  the beginning wait till you hear this this is wild so I think we got to have [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5848.98s)]
*  tough conditions tell people to come out of the shadows if they've committed a [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5855.139999999999s)]
*  crime deport them no questions asked they're gone if they if they've been [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5859.1s)]
*  working and are law-abiding we should say here are the conditions for you [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5866.660000000001s)]
*  staying you have to pay a stiff fine because you came here illegally you have [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5870.860000000001s)]
*  to pay back taxes and you have to try to learn English and you have to wait in [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5874.54s)]
*  line if Trump like you have to wait in line that's so MAGA I mean but as proves [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5879.740000000001s)]
*  the point that none of that really means they're sitting in the green room in the [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5887.1s)]
*  back before that speech and there's like some stuff written out and they're just [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5891.1s)]
*  like oh I got to try to remember all this crap like none of that meant [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5894.06s)]
*  anything you know like none of that I don't think she even believed when she [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5897.1s)]
*  said it back then it was all it was what the country wanted to hear that's all it [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5900.38s)]
*  is it's all focus group shit it's all what the country wants to hear and what [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5904.54s)]
*  the party agrees upon what the zebras all agree on the when you just said that [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5908.46s)]
*  that's it perfectly and as it morphs as it gets into trans kids you got to [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5912.42s)]
*  support trans people in the military whatever it is they just all fucking hop [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5916.58s)]
*  in line what flag am I putting in my Twitter bar and to go back to go back to [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5920.14s)]
*  what you said at the beginning about those kids that are riding with the and [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5923.74s)]
*  they don't really even know what they're riding they got the mask on but they're [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5927.98s)]
*  doing this and it's like I guess what I mean is is there's a bunch of human [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5930.86s)]
*  beings on earth especially now like in our in this sort of like American [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5934.82s)]
*  culture and all the other sub series of it like in you know Europe and everywhere [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5940.3s)]
*  so Americanized now but there's all these people who are really angry it's [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5943.78s)]
*  kind of like what it's the reason why you know there's so many of these videos [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5947.34s)]
*  where they interview like the Antifa dudes and they don't really even know [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5951.5s)]
*  why they're they're not able to talk they're not really able to articulate [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5954.98s)]
*  why they're there what they believe they're just there because they want to [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5957.54s)]
*  they're just there to riot you know right there's this like general anger [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5959.94s)]
*  that I think has that dwells in a lot of us towards the system that we realize [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5964.139999999999s)]
*  is inefficient and ineffective and rigged but it's just too complex at least [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5968.9s)]
*  individually and through the means of the internet for us to identify who our [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5973.02s)]
*  enemies really are and so instead it's like let's just go dude like let's just [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5976.18s)]
*  go let's go catch some shit on fire because at least it feels like we're [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5979.620000000001s)]
*  doing something even though but I think like I think there's a lot more in [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5983.42s)]
*  common between the patriotic cosplaying type people who who want to who talk all [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5987.700000000001s)]
*  the time about like you know that and the people who are like Antifa I [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5994.620000000001s)]
*  actually think that they're two of the same cloth they just both they both just [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=5999.0199999999995s)]
*  don't really realize it but I think I think like that there is this really [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6003.379999999999s)]
*  amazing sort of rebellious spirit of the left that just needs to be reintegrated [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6008.5s)]
*  in a society with the right and then it's like then it becomes unstoppable [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6013.98s)]
*  and it no longer becomes a left and a right thing but I just don't think like [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6017.459999999999s)]
*  I'll give you another great example like like when I was younger I'd go to these [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6021.0599999999995s)]
*  some of these protests in DC and stuff and I would always stay at George [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6027.94s)]
*  Washington University with these kids and we were all in our early 20s probably [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6030.78s)]
*  and we're all very like at that point there wasn't any like real political [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6036.259999999999s)]
*  identity to it I don't think those people would have called themselves [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6040.74s)]
*  left back then but you better believe most of them ended up going to all the [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6042.86s)]
*  black bloc and the Antifa and the Black Lives Matter and every other protest [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6046.66s)]
*  there was just because they wanted to go protest they just are like you know like [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6050.179999999999s)]
*  it's like it's like yeah it's like it's a thing of like rebelling against the [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6054.54s)]
*  system it doesn't really matter what part of the system it is or if it really [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6060.38s)]
*  even makes any sense you just know that that's yeah it's like I think I think [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6065.5s)]
*  that's what I mean it's through the means of the internet I don't think [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6069.58s)]
*  we'll ever be able to organize all those people together in a way that's [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6072.14s)]
*  productive but I do think in real life we can I do think I do think through I [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6074.58s)]
*  think music is I think that's why I want to focus mostly on music and like trying [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6079.14s)]
*  to influence in in a way to where the rich don't control it and the rich don't [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6082.94s)]
*  choose what songs we listen to and what songs make it on the charts like we do [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6086.419999999999s)]
*  I think that's the first step I think actually think music is something like I [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6090.099999999999s)]
*  guarantee you there if you looked if there was some way to run I'm sure [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6093.299999999999s)]
*  there's some report to be ran where you could see how people voted versus what [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6096.299999999999s)]
*  kind of music people listen to and I guarantee you a lot of people who voted [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6099.5599999999995s)]
*  differently listen to the same exact lyrics and resonate with them like what [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6102.219999999999s)]
*  is that like they're that's all I mean is this we're just been we we've just [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6106.419999999999s)]
*  been mass distracted in this in misled is all like also when you get these [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6110.46s)]
*  kind of organized protests they're all organized with this one thought in mind [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6114.36s)]
*  like there there's unlawful you know changes in policies that's shipping our [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6118.14s)]
*  community back to Mexico and we got to stop this these are all you know [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6125.06s)]

*  and you're all trying to like get social credit by being the most woke and the [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6148.299999999999s)]
*  most activist II and you're the person who's the most involved and you're [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6153.4s)]
*  helping to organize and you feel like get a sense of purpose and then there's [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6156.9s)]
*  also the thing of being on the ground with a bunch of other people that are [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6160.12s)]
*  moving in a certain direction that to me it I think it ignites a thing in I [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6163.419999999999s)]
*  think there's things inside of us that get ignited one of them is like here's a [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6168.74s)]
*  the best way to describe is like fishing you know when you go fishing I've seen [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6172.78s)]
*  people catch their first fish when that fish gets on either oh you get excited [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6178.139999999999s)]

*  very few people are gonna go bow hunting but the other thing that does it with is [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6196.18s)]
*  war and protests are like war you're marching you're all together who's [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6199.62s)]

*  complicated to be able to dissect it and correct it that like like with these ice [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6230.66s)]
*  protests though in other words there's been such a heavily disputed and [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6235.38s)]
*  mismanaged protocol over immigration my entire life so now it's like you can't [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6239.66s)]

*  listened to the last 20 years will say stuff like that and whatever year that [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6260.3s)]
*  was 2008 and now say gosh can you imagine if somebody said that now that [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6263.34s)]
*  they would be like they would be a racist and taken off the internet for [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6267.46s)]

*  it's for sure but there's a big difference between protests and [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6274.62s)]
*  organized protests where you're paying people and then you're leaving bricks [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6277.34s)]
*  around this is it's like it's a bastardization it's a they've they've [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6280.3s)]
*  taken over the thing this the virtue of this thing like this part of the First [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6284.900000000001s)]

*  else yeah and they've used it as a political tool I would think maybe that [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6297.900000000001s)]
*  that's happened a lot though even in in the past with like civil rights and [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6302.74s)]
*  everything else a lot of that was much more organized than it was made like I [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6306.86s)]
*  didn't know until just a couple years ago like I've learned the story all [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6310.82s)]
*  through school and heard it a million times about Rosa Parks but I didn't [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6314.259999999999s)]
*  realize until a couple years ago that she was part of some I don't know I [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6317.54s)]
*  don't even know what she was part of but she was part of some organization and it [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6321.34s)]
*  was like a planned thing I just I was always taught it like she just [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6324.179999999999s)]
*  spontaneously did it but I think another I think there's just there's every every [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6328.42s)]
*  like thing in history has this whole backstory to it that we don't really [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6334.3s)]
*  know much about most things have been manipulated if they can be manipulated [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6337.26s)]
*  once they realize they can manipulate people they started and they probably [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6341.02s)]
*  started that a long time ago I mean we've talked about it a million times so [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6343.820000000001s)]
*  that's why Smedley Butler wrote wrote war is a racket in 1933 you know major [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6348.26s)]
*  general Smedley Butler who was they tried to get him to overthrow the fucking [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6354.18s)]
*  government with a coup and he wouldn't do it and then he writes his book about [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6358.34s)]
*  how every single operation he was involved with he thought they were doing [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6361.34s)]
*  this but really they were just making it safe for bankers they're really just [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6366.3s)]
*  overthrowing a government installing a friendly one it's like it's been going on [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6369.18s)]
*  since they could and back then it was way easier to pull off because there was [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6374.02s)]
*  no internet we could pull up a Hillary Clinton video from yeah more than a [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6377.62s)]
*  decade ago and go look at her she's a pretty MAGA you can put a fucking red [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6381.54s)]
*  hat on that lady and she'd be standing on that stage right next to RFK jr. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6386.18s)]
*  You know? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6391.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah and it's just it's because there's such an information overload stuff like [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6392.299999999999s)]
*  that will always be forgotten about too soon too for it to make a difference [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6396.78s)]
*  like she could have been Trump's vice president back then yeah like no [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6399.54s)]
*  bullshit she would have been right she would have been like Queen Mom of [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6404.42s)]
*  Trump land there would be people with Hillary Clinton flags flying behind [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6407.98s)]
*  their pickup trucks with her with like two fists in the air with a MAGA hat on [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6412.099999999999s)]
*  but I remember even back then like well you know the one the one that's what [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6417.46s)]
*  made me fall in love with comedy was Norm MacDonald and like his whole bit [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6421.62s)]
*  about the Clintons and stuff and getting on the view and riling all them up and [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6424.82s)]
*  stuff but even you know back then I remember they were trying to like can't [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6428.82s)]
*  I guess he got kicked off a Saturday Night Live because of that right and all [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6432.94s)]
*  was it because of the Clintons or it might have been because of his product [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6435.54s)]
*  because he's too funny there was something else yeah but there's I don't [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6438.94s)]
*  know the funniest people of all time and his weekend update that thing that he [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6445.46s)]
*  would do was fucking fantastic it's fantastic he was the best ever at it he [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6449.78s)]
*  was so good and the jokes were so he would go so out there back when you [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6453.18s)]
*  could you know and if that's what got him kicked off a Saturday Night Live [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6459.18s)]
*  great makes him even more of a legend I think more yeah I think that's I think [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6462.54s)]
*  that's what's important about I don't I'm not a fan of all the real crazy [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6467.58s)]
*  vulgar humor sometimes and stuff like I I'm more of a norm type of comedy guy [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6471.82s)]
*  like I like the more goofy stuff that's not like constantly talking about [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6476.86s)]
*  penises and stuff but like you know or whatever like whatever it is sex and [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6479.98s)]
*  everything else but it's really important that all that stuff does exist [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6484.66s)]
*  just because of the idea of I think it's important that there's this place that [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6488.0199999999995s)]
*  exists here in Austin that freedom of speech will always be in even if you [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6491.62s)]
*  know it's like it's such a critical thing especially now more than ever I [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6495.82s)]
*  think critical for everybody even if you don't agree with it and that's what's [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6499.62s)]
*  so hard for people to recognize when people don't have a voice and someone has [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6502.34s)]
*  a voice and that voice is different than their opinion they want to shut they [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6506.0199999999995s)]
*  want to shut it down they want to silence it yeah and they want to elevate [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6509.66s)]
*  their voice nature just pure natural it's natural instincts that human beings [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6512.58s)]
*  have and you got to you got to resist that because you got to realize you [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6519.0199999999995s)]
*  don't want that used on you right well then don't use it on other people yeah [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6522.18s)]
*  everyone's guilty like I went when I was at the ARC where I get where we spoke at [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6525.62s)]
*  that thing in London there was a talk we went to I think the next night that was [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6529.82s)]
*  about freedom of speech and I can't remember the I can't remember who all [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6533.7s)]
*  was speaking there it was some people that I should probably remember but I [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6537.9s)]
*  yeah but they they were talking about it was it was it was a group that was [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6541.42s)]
*  defending people in Europe that were like bidding being arrested and stuff [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6547.26s)]
*  for things they had reposted online and all which is really important you know [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6550.82s)]
*  like they're they're arresting people for political things that they put online [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6553.94s)]
*  in Europe and like not even giving them very obscure reasoning as to why whatever [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6557.139999999999s)]
*  this in some cases they won't even tell them what they're arresting them for and [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6563.219999999999s)]
*  so like the cause of what these people are doing is very important but the [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6566.54s)]
*  whole time they're just they're referring to it as the woke mind virus [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6569.0599999999995s)]
*  which is yeah sure funny put in a bid or whatever but God like no what it is is [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6572.74s)]
*  it's like the government using this one specific thing out of a list of things [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6577.379999999999s)]
*  that they could as part of this moral high ground to arrest people for speaking [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6582.98s)]
*  out against not because it has nothing to do with anything on the left or the [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6586.179999999999s)]
*  right the fact that the state would love for people to not be allowed to [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6589.339999999999s)]
*  criticize anything because then that means they can't criticize them but by [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6592.179999999999s)]
*  them saying woke mind virus every five minutes while they're talking about it [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6595.94s)]
*  it just immediately polarizes half the people who they need to get on board in [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6599.339999999999s)]
*  order to stop it which is the left who it's like I don't know there's just I [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6602.86s)]
*  don't know I think I might try to one of these days I might just try to give the [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6607.379999999999s)]
*  old thing a run and see but I really think I could it would be it would [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6611.82s)]
*  probably a run for president it would probably any it would probably end in [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6615.74s)]
*  like a nuclear war but I think we could do I think it'd be pretty interesting I [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6619.58s)]
*  think you're gonna run for office if you will fuck that no I've no I'm not on the [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6623.54s)]
*  same page for no vermin supreme call me up no I'm just kidding I don't think I [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6630.0599999999995s)]
*  would I might do like a governor run somewhere or something or a mayor maybe [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6634.34s)]
*  I'll start with mayor maybe that's a good way a terrible job dude don't do it [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6638.54s)]
*  I would say don't do it but if you have to do it do it I mean someone should do [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6642.58s)]
*  it that's like you I just remember my whole life like since I was a kid people [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6646.58s)]
*  were like man what would happen if just we got some regular dude in there and [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6649.94s)]
*  like all this it's just like I don't know get immediately disillusioned you'd [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6653.62s)]
*  realize the entanglements that exist and I think it's impossible to navigate I [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6658.1s)]
*  think once you get in there you're like holy shit and when I talk to people that [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6663.06s)]
*  are in this administration now that weren't before that realize like all the [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6667.38s)]
*  paperwork and red tape and bureaucracy and all the different departments all [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6673.1s)]
*  the people that are controlling these departments and all the fucking [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6677.18s)]
*  resistance you have to any change and all the people that don't want to give [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6680.3s)]
*  you the information that you're asking for and it gets wild and exhausting and [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6683.46s)]
*  you're dealing with a machine that's been operating pretty much unchecked for [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6689.06s)]
*  decades. Let's check them out. Yeah. Give them the old check. Look what they did to Elon. He tried to check them out. They turned him into a Nazi. Yeah. I mean it's like well do you think was there I'm not well read on any of this this is like this is actually something I wanted to ask you about at one point or another anyway was your take on like the Elon Trump situation but you know I um apparently they're making up you think things are cool now supposedly do you think conversation on the phone the argument but the argument behind it was that they felt like Trump wasn't letting Elon see [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6694.38s)]
*  I don't I don't know what to think of I really don't know what to think of any of that situation or Elon in general and I just say I just it really fascinated me that it seemed like they were both using Doge for different reasons maybe or they had different motivations behind it but what if what if it was like a genuine what if there was genuine audits done on everything and like what if all that stuff did get uncovered and what if somebody wasn't scared to just release all that stuff and the consequences of it like people do deserve the truth like well they've released some of it [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6723.34s)]
*  right so we know a lot about USAID now we know what that was we know what crazy programs are in place we know through Mike Benz's work where the way he describes USAID as doing things that are too dirty for the CIA like he describes it being used for regime change and but under the name aid it seems like it's just aid oh we're helping people but it's agency for international development is what it really stands for so there's that that's been dismantled the thing is they're not spending less money they're spending more money [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6753.26s)]
*  there's been like a trillion dollars on the on the Pentagon it's the whole thing is kind of nuts because nobody wants to stop spending money nobody wants to lose their job and they're all in a position where they have influence and there's thousands of different points of influence and if you're the president or the vice president or you know any of these fucking people it's a very difficult road the one of the things that I felt like was the most important was Bobby Kennedy because Bobby Kennedy getting in there he was determined [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6783.26s)]
*  to find out what is the root cause of America's massive health crisis that we're all facing like why are we having this why do we have different toxins that are in our foods that are banned in Europe why are we allowing the use of these different things that we know are terrible for the body you know why is there not greater scrutiny on these pharmaceutical drug corporations why are they not you know why are they able to lie and get away with it and prescribe things for people that don't need them and and not be responsible for the [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6813.26s)]
*  health consequence of these things and that this needs to be cleaned up and so that's what he's doing right now I'm very happy and I hope that he can really make meaningful changes because it seems like he is he followed he fired the 17 people that were the head of the vaccine schedule and he's hired a bunch of new people they're all very qualified and one of them being Robert Malone Robert Malone the guy that everybody said was a kook that I got in trouble for initially for having on my podcast when they were trying to you know when fucking Neil [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6843.26s)]
*  Young was trying to get me removed from Spotify this is over Robert Malone Robert Malone who owns nine patents on the creation of mRNA vaccine technology certifiable genius like unquestionably they were calling him a kook this guy's a kook a guy who took the vaccine and had a horrible reaction they were calling him a kook so that guy being a part of this administration being a part of the you know make America healthy again movement very important all that stuff is very important for everybody not Republicans not [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6873.26s)]
*  Democrats if there's any area we where we should be bipartisan on it's that and realizing that corporations have taken advantage of loopholes and of a bunch of different creepy laws that allowed them to poison you and you're getting poisoned and you're addicted to this poison and there's a way out of this well he's he's kind of where I got the inspiration for the call idea from you know he he no well he he and I actually met he came out to my he came out to the property where we filmed [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6903.26s)]
*  Richmond and all and I met him this is before he got linked up with Trump he was still running this is during all that and he was he was still running for himself but we had a long conversation about this concept for a healing center which is like this thing that he's been kind of like as a part of all this which is like which is kind of the idea of people going out in the nature and like learning how to grow food and learning how to like because in this in this never-ending abyss of chaos where everything's changing so fast and nothing you know nature is [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6933.26s)]
*  nature has been affected by that through like some you know through chemicals and technology and other things but for the most part it's all the systems in nature all the organization there and the all that stuff is sort of like the last thing that's untouched by man you know when you go out on two or three hundred acres and you just sit there and you're watching the water go by it's like you just sort of you take everything that we've talked about like all this these are all very complex like just crazy century thousands a year long things [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6963.26s)]
*  that he that mankind have done but meanwhile nature just sort of exists and does its thing and it's like it's it's sort of a way to compartmentalize all this monstrosity into one little thing and realize that there is other there is a reality outside of the reality that like modern society has constructed us to exist in 24-7. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=6993.26s)]
*  100% like gosh dude that's the only thing that saves me is like especially being a little bit probably a little bit too introverted for this job position you know going out on tour even for a weekend or two or like dude by the time Sunday comes and we get through this and these two mothership shows we have a we got West Virginia next weekend but I'll spend this whole week I probably won't talk to anybody except for like immediate family you know I'll just have my I'll just go sit out in the woods with the dogs and just watch the birds chirp and all that but it's amazing there's something really important [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7011.26s)]
*  about that that I want to I want to I want to understand like you take if you can take two or three hundred acres like what can you plant on it that brings in the the types of nature that benefit human beings the most like I want to conduct studies on like everything from birds to plants to wildlife to different type like how do you put a human being who is so screwed up in the most optimal condition to heal and to fix like as it's obviously not the case like you're not going to go to a mental institution or and I'm not even suggesting [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7041.26s)]
*  for people who should be in a mental institution I just mean like you know people who like a guy I know who you mentioned mushrooms and stuff but there's a guy I know like that's in the Marines who's dealing with PTSD like how do you get him into a spot where he can just go out and roll you know like you can't it's hard to get it's hard to fix that part of your brain living in a city or living in a suburb and not having that like so that's you know so yeah it's just like this crazy dream I have where like it's sort of a it's a way to rebel against all of this without rebelling it's just creating a better way to do it but imagine if [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7071.26s)]
*  you like this is like the pilot program for this thing where it's this sort of outdoor amphitheater and it's like very immersive and in nature and you can and you can like re-unlock these parts of your brain you talked about that are sort of very primitive and to us and then and then just emulated over a period of time like so I'm doing these shows where they're they're they're nonprofit and the idea is just to go into an area that hasn't had music that's in an a or b ticketing market do a show there build them a blueprint whether it's on a main street or in a farm field or whatever but just somewhere where live nation and ticketmaster can't touch [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7101.26s)]
*  it build them a blueprint with like ingress egress promotions how to sell the show where to put the stage how to set everything up here's all the vendors use and then give them this blueprint where they can do it over and over and over again and just build like these sort of sanctuaries that exist all over the country that can't be like molested and preyed upon by all those big companies and all their crap and I think inherently by doing that through like music and public speaking and other things those spaces will almost serve as like like the way that communities thrive again and the way people reconnect and I joke and say that like [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7131.26s)]
*  everyone every human being likes music and food and socializing at least a little bit and if you don't you're probably a robot and we don't I don't want you there anyway kind of thing you know but like so that's that's in a nutshell but that all was inspired by Bobby sort of idea for this healing center that he talked about I think it's a place over in Italy that he used as a reference of he had a relative go to and like they were able to work with like leather and do all the stuff on a vineyard I think and it like it had a there's a lot of you know we know very little about the human mind [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7161.26s)]
*  that's why psychedelics are still illegal and so and there's so much misunderstanding and misconception and just confusion even there because think of I mean like our brains are just so infinitely complex even you know yeah so nature's definitely a part of your health without nature I don't think you really get totally we're a part of nature you know like we're a we're a natural thing existing in a world that we've created that isn't natural and so like this is all you know like this is all everything that we've talked about is just sort of man-made constructed bullshit that is [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7191.26s)]
*  now that is now reality to us but there but it's just part of a bigger thing to that is we sort of get isolated inside of especially when we're on our phone all the time it's like yeah especially I've laid off social media and it's it's amazing it's like it lifts this weight off your brain how do you how do you manage social lot this is one thing I really have a hard time with and it makes I feel bad because I end up upsetting people or whatever but like how do you a lot of people want your time and they want to send you text messages and [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7221.26s)]
*  they want to bother you with stuff and they want to and it's not even they want to bother you they really gin but like how do you manage that do you just have a small social circle or you just really social or like how do you find there's people where I just won't text him back for like months and then they then they think I hate him and it's not that I hate him it's just like I can't just sit and text I just can't send hundreds of text every day to it like I have to like how do you balance all that or how do you keep changing your phone number but you also got to get comfortable with not texting people back because you can't text everybody back [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7251.26s)]
*  I'll show you this look at see how many unread text messages I have in the upper left hand corner what does it say? 623 yeah good luck yeah how how am I gonna read those I know well I've got possible I think it goes back to my when I was at work before and I had to keep up with the phone for work and I had you know is like it's just instilled in me that like it just drives [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7281.26s)]
*  I don't know that's why yeah I've bought that flip phone that I carry and there's a good move it's a good move you get your brain back it's also tough though because there's people I do want to stay in contact with like you know yeah but you can always reach out to them yeah it's like you know we have this idea of immediate interaction with people that it's necessary it's important and sometimes it is important like maybe there's something going on maybe your wife is pregnant like who knows right you need immediate contact but most the time you don't the vast majority of the time you don't we live [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7311.26s)]
*  a long time without it yeah I mean you don't want to not be there for somebody who needs you in an emergency but other than that yeah it's good to be free you just it's better for your brain I don't like I was saying I don't think we're supposed to be getting the bad news from 8 billion people it's just too nuts it's a little we're just I don't think we're even supposed to socialize with that many I mean we we thrive in smaller I mean that's why all these yeah but we we definitely thrive in smaller yeah keep a tight tribe [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7341.26s)]
*  keep a tight tribe of people that are cool and make it so it's beneficial to everybody so there's no resentment you know that's one of the things that happens in when a guy gets really famous like you're getting is that some you can have the wrong people around you you know maybe you like look past some of the resentful behavior that they showed when you weren't successful and then it manifests itself when you're successful they look you could tell like someone around you actually wants you to fuck up and that's a two-way thing [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7371.26s)]
*  I've seen that happen with friends it's a terrible place to be there just has to be some kind of way that I don't have to be famous though like there's a way where this is yeah but there's a way where this is like I'm just like I don't know it's gotten a lot better but um you just [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7401.26s)]
*  gonna have to deal with it like I said this is the the path that you've been given in this world I just mean that I just mean that like I should like I just don't want fan I just don't want people to perceive like I'm just some dude that's written a song and work but this is like a collect like I said this is a [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7416.18s)]
*  collective thing like the fact just if you look at the if you look at the rate of people who buy my songs on iTunes versus most label artists it's like comically disproportionate like people people buy my songs out of support and stuff and so what I'm saying is that this is like a thing like this isn't just I'm sitting up here and y'all are all down there like this in my mind this is just a thing where we're all equal and it just happens to be this is the music catalog this is the music catalog that we're giving people a middle finger with but I don't I wouldn't for a second whenever [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7430.96s)]
*  think that like that I'm above somebody else on some social hierarchy because of it or something I guess I don't want to feel like I just not necessary this is just something we're like I just I'm just so excited to see where this can go in the sense of like like like I said it's just exciting that like like some just full blown idiot like me with a couple of his buddies can figure out how to do this and rally enough support up behind it I'm just like what could really happen if we like what could really happen if things were like if I actually knew what I was doing or if like enough of us got together like we could [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7460.96s)]
*  really just flip we could just flip everything upside down pretty quick and it'd be hilarious you don't have to become a different thing just because you're famous that's a myth you know you don't have to become better than people you don't have to think you're better than people just because you're famous you can maintain who you are it's totally doable totally yeah I do it I'm just me I'm the same person you are yeah I've been doing it the same and that's one of the reasons why I do the podcast the exact same way I do it the same way I don't think oh this is gonna be a big one everybody asks that's the first [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7490.96s)]
*  thing a lot of people ask is how was Joe Rogan and I was like he's Joe Rogan like there is no so much easier that way just be you all day yeah like if you've watched him on the podcast you've seen him in real life he's you know it's like me at my worst you see me at my best that's it but you know I'm a human being just like anybody else this is why why I encourage everybody who wants to do something like this to go do it anybody could do this exactly not you might not do it this well immediately because you're gonna learn how to do it but it's like everything [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7520.96s)]
*  you can learn how to do it like you you can learn how to sing you learn how to do stand up you can learn how to play guitar you can learn how to draw you can learn oh I can never do that you can some people can do it better than you some people are naturally talented in different areas you know especially when it comes to athletics but you can do it you can do it you can get better everything and getting better at something and doing something is beneficial to the whole of your life because if you can apply that same those same principles to everything [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7550.96s)]
*  you can get better at everything and you get better at being a person inspire other people like yeah like the more the more good that you can do and the more you can put out the more it inspires others to do too yeah the more work you put out to the more songs you put out like scornful woman the more stuff that like really resonates with people it affects people man it's like you it's that wings of the butterfly man you know you're like you really you like spreading it out and you know and it'll inspire more people to write songs it'll inspire more people to do things and spite it'll inspire [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7580.96s)]
*  people to write books it's just that's what we do we inspire people people inspire people and people by doing something that we know is difficult and they get through it and they create something like wow and you go to see you know fucking you too with the sphere like wow yeah you know that's what it's all about man you know that's that's the beautiful thing that is this kind of artistic connection that you have with the community with the people that that enjoy your work as long as you respect [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7610.96s)]
*  that and as long as you understand what it is you'll be great you're just gonna have to deal with being famous bitch you know I I have to I have to you know like I do I do think you're actually right I probably was a little misspoken or now that you say what you said about AI being able to replace music and stuff I do agree that like there is a part of it that AI will never they'll never understand the human experience enough to be able to write music about it that's that captivates people in a way that music can that's been written by people I do [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7640.96s)]
*  agree with that. Your songs. They can make it sound better and cooler and catchier but I do think like I do think the people that are really writing it are the ones that and the ones that really write I mean like just to talk about the songwriting writing process was [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7670.96s)]
*  I had been we had just gotten done with the touring over the summer for the most part in twenty twenty four and well obviously things are what they are but there's just been there was just a like multiple different negative things happening at once and I kind of got in this I got in a spot where I did my thing where I sort of spiraled and just was isolating myself and so I spent a month and a half or two months in that house pretty much I didn't do I didn't do Thanksgiving or Christmas [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7684.66s)]
*  last year I just just really didn't hardly talk to anybody or anything and so I was like at a you know I was in it was in a position it was in a position where it was like probably time to write a song like that and and there's a few things I do want to clarify to talking about this but so anyway so me Draven from Radio WV and Joey are all sitting in the kitchen of this house where we recorded the song and it's probably in the fall sometime and Joey is three in the morning right and we like we were all just like wired and [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7714.66s)]
*  I can think about Joey talking about really want to write a song and so him and Draven were asking me about my songwriting process and what I do and so like I just went got the car and I said we were sitting there around the table and I can remember was me and Joey sitting here and Draven leaning up against the counter and we were just talking about it and I said well I said if you're going to write a song as like the first thing you got to do is figure out what you're going to write about and it's got to be something that you feel not something that you can just articulate about it's got to be something that's like in there that needs to come out you know and so we sat there for like ten seconds and [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7744.66s)]
*  Scornful woman was the word that was used you know and it was like it was it was specific relationships but also it was a collection of all like the experiences that we had all had like I think in horrible we'd all had horrible relationships to in the course we all have you know like every dude on earth has been has been through what that song talks about in one way or another let's queue it up yeah let's queue it up Jamie queue it up but within two or three minutes the whole song was written it was just like it just it just came out you know that's [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7773.66s)]
*  AI is not going to do that there's something there's there's there's there's things that resonate in that song that AI is never going to be able to understand yeah yeah and that's the thing that's the thing that's going to separate people from the machine and live performance that this kind of stuff this kind of stuff right here Mercer County West Virginia [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7803.66s)]
*  Well she got a side to her I want to run from she'll turn a warm afternoon into a cold cold one well he grabbed the apple and Adam took a bite and now all these years later and the mass still ain't right with a scornful woman [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7833.66s)]

*  I used to sleep so good didn't have a night there I was busy dreaming believing he's always gonna be right there and now the middle of the day is like the middle of the night and the court says fifty-fifty but the mass still ain't right with a scornful woman [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7875.66s)]

*  it's in the description of the video but there's a the biggest shout out of all this is to the there's a firefighter that we he let us use this footage too I think it's out of Brazil but the name of the firefighters in the description but for the GoPro footage it was really cool he let us use that [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=7995.66s)]
*  that's a real fire yeah that's a real firefighting GoPro video that we found and we reached out to the guy and asked him if we could use it but I just wanted to give him a shout out on here there you go [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8014.66s)]

*  I just got a bunch of little clips like that of where we were practicing the guitar parts but anyway I got a few more that are like pretty heavy I don't know what they are I don't know people figure it out there's something I don't I don't even I don't like to even try to describe many of that stuff because I don't know what it is but so are you gonna release it all as a full album or you gonna just do it like um song at a time probably just song at a time right now just cuz it's simpler that way yeah and then I'll [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8135.66s)]
*  just I don't know what I'm gonna I don't know what the long-term plan is I want to get I'll get to the end of this tour this year in October and you don't need a long-term plan yeah just keep doing what you like doing yeah I will yeah this all long-term plan shit that's people with vision boards you don't yeah you're right yeah no you're right I haven't take I've just tried to take it I do have to think long-term though cuz I want to make the most of this just for I don't know man the only thing I want like I just want to look back when I'm old and just think like [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8165.66s)]
*  just think like fuck yeah we did it like well if you just keep doing what you're doing you will do that 100% yeah but I mean bigger I just want to see like I just want to see the I just want to I don't know I just want to watch the machine crumble you know like I just I have this like thing it's gonna probably crumble on its own it'll still exist in some form but you know as long as you can thrive without it it doesn't matter it really doesn't matter and more people [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8195.66s)]
*  realize that there's a way to do it that's authentic there's always gonna be people that are drawn to that and it'll be more and more people as things get more and more disconnected and feel less and less human yeah there's this one more there's been so many big people go up against it and not be able to quite figure it out like even Pearl Jam back in the 90s you know trying to go up against I think live nation it was or ticketmaster and I don't know man I just want to see that's like that that would be my biggest that would be the biggest thing that I would feel some sense of accomplished [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8225.66s)]
*  about long time is like this how do you get all these people together who have been disenfranchised by the music industry and just rally them together in a way that like it's not to take anyone down or to do anything bad at all towards anybody but it's just to like imagine what society would be with real music again without a bunch of label propped up shit and every stuck in everybody's head like what if people really listen to what they loved and like that and like it was real it was like the organic side of things is what drove music through the roof like imagine what that would imagine what just think about what music can do [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8255.66s)]
*  to you like not even in the moment but just what it means to you over time like going back and I go back all the time like and I listen to like a 1999 live like a like a live stained session or something from back then and just or like old Hank Williams the third songs or like I don't know stuff I listen to a lot as a kid and like man it was unlock all these memories you think about like all of a sudden you're like back in a place that you never even remembered you ever were it's just it's such a powerful thing on us [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8285.66s)]
*  so I'm sorry I just miss yeah but that's yeah it is powerful man it's powerful to do what you're doing what you're doing is that you're doing that yeah I'm not doing nothing in that roof shut the fuck up you are you are you're in that groove you know just keep doing what you're doing it's awesome and it's inspiring and more people are gonna do it and I love that you want to help more people do it that's great because I'm guarantee you there are these Charlie Crockett's out there there's these guys out there that people haven't heard of before and then you see him playing on street corner [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8315.66s)]
*  one day like where are you from like how are you doing this this is crazy yeah you know there's people like that out there in the world I remember we went what was that place that we went to saw Ellis Bullard the white what is it called white horse yeah yeah and we're like who is fucking guy here in town right yeah nobody there we went there last time we were here we're planning on going back we was actually thinking about trying to swing by there this evening and say a little spot that was so much fun last great little spot so there's people like that out there you know they just have to get an audience yeah you know someone has to [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8345.66s)]
*  you know give them a little boost reach back grab their hand help them up yeah that's one of the best things about the comedy community right now so we all do that for each other so it's like there's a real pathway so there's a lot of people that are moving to Austin from all across the country you know that like hey I think if I get there that's a place where you could really launch from what's powerful about your platforms here like you and just and all the other people like you said that are in that network is that you this is all stuff that you've built that you have control over like these are [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8375.66s)]
*  that's what's cool about is it's like this sort of new it's a whole new business that you've kind of got here like in the comedy world it's not it's not owned by anybody or anything it's like it's wild and free and chaotic and it could go anywhere and that's what's that's what's exciting to me is like dude like I said I just don't know I just don't know what who knows what will even come of what you got going on here and in Austin but this has has shaped a lot like you know in a world where everything is [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8405.66s)]
*  so it's so predicted like there's less and less people able to sit around in a boardroom in a skyscraper somewhere and decide what the next big thing is going to be it's like it's more it's I don't know it's just it's exciting to be a part of that despite all the there's so many ways that you can you can look negatively about everything going on but there is this sort of transfer of power that I just hope can happen in a we only have a very short window of time for it to happen and you know pretty soon pretty soon we'll all have a neural link and we'll be we'll be talking each other [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8435.66s)]
*  and people you know but we've got a little bit of time maybe before that yeah maybe I think we're the last real people we're the last people that knows what it was like before to understand what's it what like what real life really is and it's so hard to even say what that what that even means but I just mean that like even already there's people on YouTube that that comment on a video that's AI everyone in its AI the whole narrative is and it'll have like a million and like probably half the people commenting on it or bots [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8465.66s)]
*  too but I just mean it's not even like we're gonna be deceived that way I think at some point it'll almost somehow somehow it'll come to a point where we won't really understand what is real life or what is digitally artificially created and it won't even it's not that we won't even be able to tell the difference but we won't even care to tell the difference the the fake world will feel more real than the real world in a short period of time somehow like it'll it will it'll influence our our our sensory like it [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8495.66s)]
*  will influence that more than real life will like it'll become just like everything will just feels I mean it already feels that way that's what we're so drawn and all but as it all becomes more realistic and more creative and more tailored to to draw us and it will be just mass deception this is [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8525.66s)]
*  probably might have already happened this is what's really terrifying is the simulation theory the idea that oh I would be able to know if it was a simulation would you I don't know you know Elon thinks it's a simulation he thinks the chances of it [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8541.9s)]
*  not being a simulation are in the billions he thinks that this whole thing is probably our consciousness interacting with a program which is very bizarre to think but if you keep going with what we're doing right now that is inevitable if you look at the way [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8555.62s)]
*  technology is recreating things with AI and making things look completely realistic and then you you extrapolate you look into the future 20 30 40 50 years yeah they're gonna be able to give you an experience that's you're not gonna know so how do you know if that's already happened and maybe that's how the world actually works maybe this idea of the material world is an illusion and that everything is your consciousness interacting well we're only able to perceive reality through a limited through limited means I mean right [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8575.66s)]
*  sight sound smell etc like there's there could be components of reality here that we're not able to see I mean and that's where like I definitely lean into recognizing that there is this whole likes I do believe there is this whole spiritual element at play to and I see yeah it's just it's hard to it's just no there's no way to tell but this it's kind of like it's funny though because the same mentality that you could use to think about the world being a simulation you could also think about it being I mean it's so organized and so perfect that yeah I agree that it's operating on some [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8605.62s)]
*  program I just think that that program is being mandated and created by by what is represented in my mind is God or you know Jesus Christ other people may just be considered like a like a software or program but it is all the same thing obviously there is some like life is a thing that we don't quite understand that that finds itself in the in the midst of so many different parts of reality like life like just in the soil there's so many different millions of bacteria that just make it possible for stuff to even be able to grow and all those things are arguably intelligent and have these organs [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8635.62s)]
*  systems and then you see the way birds fly in the sky and just the way that like the way that even we have these sort of inherent parts programmed into us it's just it's there's really no way to tell but what's so funny is that in just a short period of time we'll all be forgotten about anyway and we'll never really know and maybe even this even this technology that has existed has existed before and we'll go away again it's just no way to really tell I think at the end of the day like to your point I think humanity and the truth within it is what is all that really exists and everything else just sort of [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8665.62s)]
*  swirls about and and we're always wanting to expand upon what already exists you know we're not creatures that like repetition or we like to just always figure out what the next big thing is even if it is our demise you know it's weird we're sort of we're sort of chasing to build these to build our replacement somehow I don't know oh that's a fact yeah we're definitely doing that no question at all we've already replaced our memory with your contact list I mean how many numbers I know like three people's phone numbers [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8695.62s)]
*  I used to know everyone's phone number I used to be able to rattle off all my friends phone numbers I used to be able to call them from a payphone those I got a hold of people back in the day now I don't remember anything I remember my high school phone number that I had when I was a kid I don't remember my best friend's phone number I can remember my best friend's phone number from high school he still has it and I'll still text him now and then yeah but that's great but it's crazy that you your contact list has replaced your memory it has yeah yeah and then you know anytime you have a question [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8725.62s)]
*  you just press that button on your phone hey you know what year was this you know what year was Gettysburg what year you know and you can find anything instantaneously and that's good but it's also weird because now you're dependent upon that thing and you're connected to that thing that thing is just gonna get more and more part of your life whereas you said before you can't even leave your house without your phone you feel weird yeah but that all those resources right now are used because there is no like real protocol or way for us to be necessarily productive with it [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8755.62s)]
*  like like in a broader spectrum that a lot of people just use all those tools and resources as just endless entertainment and mind-numbing distraction but really all that stuff is makes us super powerful if we're able to harness it correctly like I said like like just imagine the imagine the information in the data and the resources that we have access to that people like kings and dictators and emperors and the most powerful people in the world could have never dream like we have it just right here for free on our phone like I think we don't realize how informative [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8785.62s)]
*  we are in comparison to people in the past people in the past were extremely naive about the way things work just that has just been something that we have just accepted as being normal in the last 20 years but it's not normal it's not normal to know this much about congressional insider trading you know like how do we all know about that now and how do we all know that it's been going on forever nobody did anything about it you know there's a lot of things that we know now that make the people the powers that be very creeped out [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8815.62s)]
*  you know including things like podcasts they don't like it at all that there's no one that no corporate entity pulling strings behind the scenes is just people and that some person like a field on or whoever can have whoever they want on anytime they want and say whatever they want that person might say some wild shit that has the Internet scrambling is this true and then they have to Google it they don't like that at all they don't like that this affects elections that people realize like you're being lied to hey the [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8845.62s)]
*  the FBI contacted Facebook was telling them to remove factual information because it might affect the election like this is crazy like the stuff that we know now that a lot of people know now was the stuff of conspiracy fantasy when I was 20 years old but what does it really mean to us though because yeah we know all that about Facebook but we also use Facebook like like it's I think that [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8875.62s)]
*  now our our ability to communicate has become so contingent upon these platforms that we know they're no good for us we know they harvest our data and they all the terrible things that are associated with them but we still like where else where else but Facebook marketplace can you find all these sweet you know I mean that's like you don't have to get totally influenced by it though the more you're where they're influencing you less effect it has on you you know the more you're aware of the magic trick you're like oh that rabbits up his sleeve there's just a connectivity that we can't find elsewhere so there's this [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8905.62s)]
*  void that we have to like we have to use it to fill the void I guess is what I mean you don't like maybe through like that's why I really want to try doing I've had two or three people really pushing me have you to try to do jiu jitsu but that's something more like it's the it's like the community and the relationships you get out of it that's just important maybe then the practice of it itself like the I don't know that's the way it's been like maybe in those sort of circles you do get that but you just don't get it in a you know there's not a lot of broad ways to get it now but jiu jitsu is definitely a way to do it it's also a way where you get out [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8935.62s)]
*  of all of your aggression in a very healthy way in a cooperative way you're doing it with other people that are your friends and the beautiful thing about jiu jitsu sparring as opposed to like when I was kickboxing like you kind of resented your sparring they're fucking you up you know they're rocking you whereas in jiu jitsu even if someone taps you a lot you you're still their friend you know you realize like oh you got and they'll tell you you can't you can't do that with the right arm the right arm has to stay tied to your chest because otherwise once it's exposed what I'm trying to do is [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8965.62s)]
*  get you to do that so I can go to the other side like okay let's try it again I'll show I'll show a guy and when you do that with people you're you're helping your friend beat you next time but that's the way to get better like you know Eddie Bravo taught me that a long time ago he goes the more you teach people to catch you and the stuff that you do the more people you'll be able to get it in people that even know it's coming you'll be able to sharpen that technique up even more if you can get people that know what you're doing you tell them what you're doing you can still do it like Hicks and Gracie used to tell people [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=8995.62s)]
*  I'm gonna get you in an arm bar on your right arm you're like the fuck you are and you would still get it but he was so much better than everybody that he would do that on purpose and there's a beautiful thing about learning something that's very difficult that prepares you for life also the other beautiful thing about jiu jitsu in terms of your mental health is that it's so difficult to do that it makes regular life easy and regular conflict seems to be silly like sometimes people get like super nervous if two people [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9025.62s)]
*  are just yelling at each other and you think a fight may break up if you're like so used to strangling people that's like totally normal like oh you guys gonna fight like you see that in this you see that in some of the videos that go around where somebody will get like broken into like they're happy and it's like the security footage like I'm trying to think there was one that went around recently like some guy was trying to break into a UFC fighters truck and he went out there and just like kicked his ass I think that was a yeah he tried to card Jack Justin Gaethje and he beat the fuck out of him yeah the guy did that with John Jones John Jones ran out with a shotgun and a fucking [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9055.62s)]
*  Belgian Malinois like that's the wrong dude to break into his house he's ready and Sean Strickland that was another one Sean ran out with a pistol yeah I was thinking of that one yeah there's there's a lot of the you could fuck with the wrong dude and that happens that there's a there's a lot of those wrong dudes out there now there's so many people that are training in martial arts now you never know like you're picking a fight with someone you don't fight you are rolling the dice dudes are a lot scarier in real life than on TV to like hell yeah I finally got to meet I met I've met Brock Lesnar [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9085.62s)]
*  a couple times now I've just ran into him randomly and just like the size of his hands you're just like god like what like where did this guy come he's just like a machine he's a Viking yeah 100% Viking DNA 100 but I don't know the X there's no exercise I'm aware of that like it makes your fist twice the size of a normal man he's just like yeah he's just like me his daughter yeah his daughter's a shot put champion like she's Louise she's a tank yeah that's just pure Viking genetics man those are the people at the front of the boat with the [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9115.62s)]
*  big battle axe you saw that both pull up to your village you better start running to those mountains I just can't imagine having to get in the ring with a guy like that and like no you gotta you just like god like good luck I know you know imagine the guys beat him too yeah [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9145.62s)]
*  crazy guys beat his ass you know Alistair Overeem beat his ass Cain Velasquez beat his ass there's guys better than him which is always a bigger fish yeah and Cain wasn't even bigger Cain was a bad motherfucker he was like 240 he was like 25 pounds [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9160.5s)]
*  lighter than Brock and he still beat his ass who and who in fighting right now is exciting you like coming up and there's so many guys there's so many men did you watch Merab's last fight last weekend Merab Dwabeshwili and Sean O'Malley [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9175.58s)]
*  that guy is insane he's insane his cardio is like something to that everyone who has been involved in the sport for as long as I have is blown away by it the guy's a freak Daniel Cormier went to visit him after he won the title he won the title Saturday night in the sphere in Vegas beat Sean O'Malley dominant five round decision that just steamrolled him the next day Daniel Cormier goes to visit him he's out running yeah [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9190.22s)]
*  I mean doesn't stop yeah doesn't stop just this guy from Georgia from this you know war-torn country who is just embraces that fucking grind at a level that nobody else can compete with and when he gets in the ring like no one can match his cardio no one can match his pace he melts the greatest of the greats you see guys like Umar Nurmagomedov who's elite he's world-class like in any other time he would be a world champion and Merab's just overwhelming [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9220.18s)]
*  him you see him just getting overwhelmed by the pace and Merab doesn't even get tired he's a freak so he's trained he's probably trained in Georgia most of his life then do you think that gives him an advantage like he's been he's trained in like sort it maybe his fighting style or is it just like is he doing the same type of fighting but just better you think or is it just that they can't read evolution of his his technique so a lot of it is in America so it's just his mindset in his his drive and I think some of it you know for us a hobby did a whole video about him saying you need [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9250.18s)]
*  to be studied in a lab for us a hobby who runs tri star in Montreal it's like one of the greatest gyms of all time and he's one of the best minds ever in the history of MMA and he's blown away by this guy he's like there's guys that are on EPO which is like you know that's the cyclist take that makes you have more blood cells and it makes you have more cardio but it's you can have a fucking stroke it's like super dangerous to take but that's like a lot of the like tour de france guys get busted for that kind of shit some fighters get busted he's like guys that I know that have been on [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9280.18s)]
*  EPO don't have that kind of cardio this is crazy cardio this is like something freakish and he's like he thinks some of its genetic but Marab says it's not Marab says no I used to get tired I used to get tired he's just I mean he's a freak he's a freak and he just keeps getting better with his technique he gets better with everything that drive is not just for his cardio that drive is for his whole skill set so he's a fucking monster and then Ilya Toporya who's fighting Charles Oliver at the end of the month like that guy is insane that guy's knocked out [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9310.18s)]
*  two of the greatest featherweights of all time Volkonovsky and Max Holloway nobody could knock those guys out in featherweight before and he did it and he did it and he made it look easy you know he made it look like they like he's just on another level from everybody you know and then now he's moving up to 155 pounds he's like decided he cleared out that division he's moving up like he's insane yeah there's guys like that that are just so they're just they're their level is above everybody else's level and with Ilya it's everything it's his submissions his kicks his punches everything he does he can do [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9340.18s)]
*  anything I mean he does everything perfect all his technique is perfect he's fucking driven and ultra confident you know this is an amazing time for the sport man it's a it's a crazy time because these guys that are coming in with like one fight in the UFC they look like world-class contenders like right away yeah well it's cool because it seems like it's it's like a really it's a really good way to get like obscure people into the spotlight like it doesn't seem it seems like if you can just go in there and fight good that you [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9370.18s)]
*  it's like you can really work your way up to the top pretty quick I guess like I guess it does take some fights but like if you're even if you're like the guys that are in the top at the UFC now how many fights do you think it takes them before they wreck it like how many big wins is it really just a winner too I guess if they're big enough and they're like it really depends entirely on their skill set and who they're fighting and how good they are when they get into the organization like the best example of a quick rise to the top is Alex Pereira but Alex Pereira is one of the greatest kickboxers of all time [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9400.18s)]
*  and Alex Pereira when he entered into the UFC like a lot of people were completely unaware of him and me as a giant kickboxing fan he was the guy that I was like when this motherfucker comes over here bodies are gonna drop man I'm telling you you ain't never seen nothing like I remember Daniel Cormier saying to me like really I'm like dude I'm telling you I was pointing to him on his debut I go that's the motherfucker that's the boogeyman of boogeymen I go he knocks people into orbit and I was showing him some videos of kickboxing fights [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9430.18s)]
*  he was like holy shit I go dude everybody he touches he's got the touch of death and then we start steamrolling people in the UFC and he knocked out Strickland in one round and the the opening fight that he had when he hit that dude with a flying knee and just sent him into orbit and everyone was like whoa I'm like yeah dude this guy is scary so that guy was within three years was a two division world champion which is just nuts like nobody's done that before [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9460.18s)]
*  and you know defended the light heavyweight title multiple times in just a few years and he's only really been fighting MMA for like five or six years that's the excitement I think of MMA over other athletics maybe it's just the unpredictability of it that like anybody can just come in and catch everybody off guard and you just don't ever know it's just yeah well it's specialists so the thing about specialists is if you're a specialist kickboxer what you really need is someone to teach you how to fight on the ground like and he had Glover Toshiro who was also a former UFC [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9490.18s)]
*  light heavyweight champion one of the greatest and an amazing technician and Glover helped him along with all his other training partners avoid the takedowns learn how to fight off learn how to fight on the ground learn how to get back up to your feet when you got a guy who's the best of the best kickboxers every fight start standing up so while you're standing there with him this is you gotta get that guy to the ground you gotta get that guy to the ground this is terrifying and he'll fight with broken toes he fought he's fought so fucked up before he [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9520.18s)]
*  fought when when he fought Yuri Prohaska the first time he had a completely blown out knee like his knee wouldn't support him he knocked Yuri Prohaska out with a left hook and then he got his knee fixed came back fought him again and iced him in the second round and he's just different man he fought this last fight with a broken hand and he had norovirus and still lost a close decision in the fifth round maybe it almost yeah it almost helped like almost helps him like that nah it doesn't it definitely does it you could tell his [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9550.18s)]
*  energy was lower in that last fight than it has been in the past like the Khalil roundtree fight was a fucking master class and Khalil is like one of the best strikers in the light heavyweight division and Alex just pieced him apart I think about what happens to what happens after their careers are finished like what do they where do they direct all of that energy to or does it or does it is it difficult when you're if is it does it is difficult when you're a high level fighter and then you get out of it like your whole identity is wrapped up in it you know I just messaged Sean Strickland [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9580.18s)]
*  the other day because I saw that he was talking about his investments and that he's got he's got four million in investments and he's doing really well and then you know he's got a plan like Sean is very intelligent he's wild and crazy says crazy shit but very intelligent and I was very happy I imagine that makes me feel so good that you've like you're really thinking about like having money in the bank retirement investments so you're good you're good forever and he'll always be able to do seminars and things along those lines people it's very very [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9610.18s)]
*  valuable to be like a former champion you can visit gyms and people will line up and pay 50 bucks and you can teach them things that will genuinely help their careers so that a lot of guys have a thing like me she Tate she was just in Austin recently and she she went to Ways to Well to get some work done on her knee and she was out here doing seminars so she's traveling their family around the country and they'll go and she'll teach a seminar at a gym and then they'll go you know on an RV trip you know nice family time yeah have a good time in between but they can make [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9640.18s)]
*  a lucrative living doing that which is really nice you know yeah it's hard for them the identity things very hard well I just wanted to like the it seems like some of those people are well you know this is totally different than MMA fighters but I look at like like a great example is like like that David Goggins type of thing where they're like just added like you said dude man like you fight in the next day you're able to go run it's just like what happens when all that slows down do you redirect that somewhere do you think it's difficult like if you don't have somewhere to just you know you found this really effective way to displace all of [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9670.18s)]
*  this because obviously those people have got something in them that like drives their spirit to be able to do that well I think George St. Pierre has the healthiest model because George still trains almost every day and George still comes to Austin to train with the Donahers and Gordon Ryan all these elite jiu-jitsu guys and he'll still go to Thailand and train Muay Thai he's a genuine martial artist and maybe maybe he stopped before he destroyed himself too much he definitely did he definitely did he's in good he definitely did do you [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9700.18s)]
*  think those guys will ever come back like like I know there was rumors about do you think they would ever do you think for them that it would be beneficial for them to come back and fight once they've been out of it for so long like like the Tyson fight and stuff was that that seemed like and I don't even know that's a whole nother can of worms and I don't I'm not articulate enough in this space to like give my opinions on things but I just I would have liked to see Mike Tyson just I don't know just seemed like that just wasn't it didn't seem like he enjoyed that coming back I bet he enjoyed the 20 million bucks he did I think that's why he did it [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9730.18s)]
*  for money and I'm happy that he could do it for money I'm happy that he can make a large amount of money doing something like that that's all say about that yeah but you're not supposed to be getting hit really hard in the head when you're 57 or 58 years old it's probably not the best thing for your your health and at a certain point in time I kind of stopped kickboxing for the most part when I was like 30 I was like this is just not good for you you know I was still sparring and I was I was acting at the time so I was doing news radio and [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9760.18s)]
*  I was still going to the gym and kickboxing and you know sometimes I'd have like a little black eye that I have to get touched up with makeup and shit before I go out to like and I kept doing jujitsu but jujitsu I would get black eyes and jujitsu sometimes too but jujitsu didn't I didn't get my head rattled the same way like you still accidentally catch a knee sometimes and or you headbutt each other sometimes something elbow stuff happens but it's not like the constant jabs to the face and kicks to the body and you [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9790.18s)]
*  just get you you're beating your brain up you know and it's just not good for you at a certain point in time like if you're an athlete and you're competing professionally you manage it you do your best to recover and take care of your health but there's a part is a price you pay and I don't think you should pay that price if you don't have to you know and that's what that's the thing about sparring that's like especially if you're sparring with someone who's like a hard hitter and they they're not that good at pulling punches and then it gets competitive and next thing you know you're basically fighting on fighting somebody [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9820.18s)]
*  happens all the time happens all the time happens in a lot of gyms it happens more often than not you're actually fighting rather than sparring and just lucky you're not knocking each other unconscious every day you know because it's like your skill but there's there's something to be said for that if you're fighting because like you got to be aware that there's real consequences to these shots and if someone's pity patting you in sparring maybe you'll develop a false sense of security you know and someone crack you you got to be on the edge all the time like for us a hobby who I was talking about earlier would pay sparring partners to try to knock George St. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9850.18s)]
*  Pierre out he would pay them I want you to try to knock him out like for real because he wanted George to be like really prepared you know you're going in there and you know you're gonna fight some fucking killer you know you can't be kind of half you're you know you're you're fighting Carlos [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9880.18s)]
*  Connor he's gonna try to take your head off you got to be training with guys that are trying to take your head off you know when they're in the middle of those fights is it a lot of muscle memory or are they consciously thinking like I feel like a lot of it is they've trained so much that it's more automatic right when they get in that fight [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9894.5s)]
*  like like like like the way you see these these slow motion replays of fights and they're able to like almost predict their opponent's move and like react in real time with it and like just use it to their advantage that's all sort of almost it's not involuntary but they've like trained their muscle memory to react that way I guess more so than them yeah more so than them having to like think like oh here it comes I'm gonna you know it's just so incredible to watch it like the way it's sometimes those fights are so good they almost like it's almost like core [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9909.3s)]
*  it's so good the way they're able to like use their opponent's movements and to their own advantage and stuff that's what's so so crazy to me watching them just watching how like a human being can get to that level to where oh yeah so good you know when someone's at the elite level like the highest of high levels it's an amazing thing to watch like there's a guy who's defending his flyway title at the end of June Alexandre Pantoja he's one of the best fighters of all time I mean he's so fucking good but he's [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9939.3s)]
*  125 pounds so people you know they don't appreciate him as much as if that guy was 170 he'd be a fucking superstar he's so good he's so good everywhere elite black belt on the ground nasty striking hyper aggressive just dominant just comes in he has this look in his eyes like I am here to fuck you up and it's awesome to watch I mean he's like when a guy reaches the pinnacle of his career like when he's at the height of his powers when he's at the peak of his [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9969.3s)]
*  performance and career and as a elite MMA fighter it's something to behold man it really is when you watch a guy just piece a guy up and take him apart like god damn you know I'd never get bored with it never never get bored calling the fights never get bored like when I know it's a UFC night I'm like oh baby here we go it still gets you excited just like it did at the beginning yeah and Daniel Cormier who was a two division world champion who's sitting next to me he gets fired up I mean he's like grabbing my shoulders oh man [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=9999.3s)]
*  here we go here we go we get so fired up and it's you know as far as excitement generated I think it's the most exciting thing in the world I don't think there's anything like two people trying to figure each other out yeah you know I mean and then when someone's in that flow state it's amazing thing to watch it's beautiful when they really hit that flow state they just everything is just perfect oh man that's so hard to get there it's like an art form that you really can only truly appreciate if you understand [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10029.3s)]
*  the amount of effort that it took to get to that point if you could do a little bit of it you can do it somewhat you know you have to be able to do some martial arts to really appreciate what they're doing you know you can see somebody kick something in the head like wow that's crazy but to really know how hard it is to pull off what he did it's just like it's easy it's easy to watch world star hip-hop where they're just like sucker punching each other but to watch a guy exhibit that kind of skill on somebody else knowing that like and not even knowing like I said just meaning like the the few you have [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10059.3s)]
*  see fighters that I've met and stuff just looking at him and being like gosh dude like these dudes are just animals you know like to start and then to watch somebody else be able to exhibit that kind of just to kind of like unleash that kind of skill on him is just you're right this it's such a raw it unlocks such a it unlocks that sort of monkey part of our brain it's just like yeah you know it's so it's hard to yeah it's just such a such a human thing I guess yeah like when people are really into cricket and someone scores in cricket they get excited I don't give a fuck but if somebody kicks somebody in the head [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10089.3s)]
*  everybody knows what happened well that's the I think that that's the same psychology behind chicken fighting which is surprisingly prevalent like where we recorded this song and all that still but like with the it's kind of the same like that that's just that's what they do up there they don't hit each other they just get chickens and do it and they gamble that's the big thing is gambling on chicken fights it's a big deal it's a big deal it's a big deal up there yeah I was just telling story the other day about this guy that was my landscaper that took me to this mech [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10119.3s)]
*  Mexican neighborhood that he lived in and his buddy had all these chickens like in cages like all over the place yeah these roosters and they had a big pit where they would roast goats and they would just get the chickens out put them in the box and gamble and it was like I was explaining like you want to talk about like integrated societies this was a completely Mexican neighborhood in LA like none of the signs are in English everything is in Spanish everybody spoke Spanish well you go down the street here this fucking roosters everywhere man but it's like that that's part [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10149.3s)]
*  of their culture it's cruel and awful but so is chicken farming you know yeah they'd make soup out of the chickens after they have them fight each other it's kind of fucked up but it's just it's that same sort of like it's the same it goes back to like the Coliseum it's that same kind of thing like it's that part of our brain that like everybody's got some chase to get there but yeah I've always wondered that with the fighters I've the worst is dogfighting yeah that's the one I you know that man makes my stomach turn right that one bothers [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10179.3s)]
*  me because they like fighting they really do pit bulls love it they're fighting they're biting each other in the face and wagging their tails they really enjoy it but it's like god don't do that don't do that you just like we don't want that yeah you know yeah maybe it's when it's something you eat you don't feel so bad about it but when it's a dog it's like I just love dogs it's way too much man that to me you know and I know the dog wants to do it which is even more fucked up you know they want to fight but they're bred for it that's what's so crazy people are so psycho they bred a [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10209.3s)]
*  dog that wants to fight all the time and will fight anything they'll fight bulls they used to use them to grab bulls yeah yeah yeah dogs well you know where I was at in Virginia we had um I yeah I was I don't know if I'd say we were officially dating or not I kind of was hoping we were but I was there was this girl I used to talk to a lot in middle school and they you know they weren't they didn't live too far away from Michael Vick's place when all that went down so she actually had some puppies that were originally they never fought they were still puppies [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10239.3s)]
*  when he got busted but they were some of Vicks dogs that she had I remember as a kid and that was like yeah that I remember when all that went down I didn't live you know we weren't relatively that far away from where all that happened but that was a real eye-opening experience for a lot of people they're like wait what that guy's doing that that's crazy but I'm the same way I I have I have dogs and humans are like at the same level of importance to me almost you know like I finally replaced I didn't it's not a not in any way to say replace but just like [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10269.3s)]
*  for me I've always I'm used to having three or four dogs around because once you train if you train a couple dogs real good and you get a couple more nine times out of ten they'll just learn everything from you kind of get this pack mentality and so I've had four for forever and then I had gotten down the two when I lost who to the white shepherd so I finally just got this black German Shepherd off this lady who was real really nice lady and it wasn't she didn't necessarily neglect the dog but the dog was just a breeders dog so all she did was just have puppies with it and let's say like here I am I'm taking this five-year-old black German Shepherd [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10299.3s)]
*  down like to go swimming in the creek with us and stuff and like it was like her first time stepping on a stick you know she stepped on a stick and like jump completely in the air like she didn't know what it was you know now within two weeks now she's like swimming in the creek with them and running all around and she acts like she's a farm dog but like this dog had just kind of been in this lady's front yard for years I guess and just didn't hadn't even gotten it but to me it's like here I am I'm like right it's like you know they're like they're my children you know they just I don't I can't I can't separate a dog and a human and level of you know it's like that like you're just like [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10329.3s)]
*  it's like that that theoretical scenario where the trains coming and you got to figure out which way to switch the tracks and it's like elderly people are dogs and you're like yeah but I'm with you I love I'm a yeah I just love I love dogs I like people more than dogs but I love dogs yeah but yeah people are more important to me but it's close it's close there's some people that I would kill for my dog hey while I'm here I'm gonna go pick up poppy or whatever is I got I wish I would have I wish I would have saved him on there I think [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10359.3s)]
*  his name was poppy or buddy or something but that little chihuahua at the so he means society I might I don't know he's really goofy he's like 12 years old or something so he just needs somewhere to go you know you'll give him the last few years of his life awesome oh and then it would be telling all the other people Oliver Anthony came and got me rich man from Richmond guy what a sweetheart yeah he likes me more than people yeah yeah this is exciting I the mothership and just being able to go on there and do music [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10389.3s)]
*  and stuff is gonna be nuts I've got a few like I brought up I got a friend of mine named Craig who's like one of my buddies growing up who does just like amateur state but he's really funny guys I got him doing a little bit and I've got hit cock 45 son John who he does comedy in Chicago right now he's gonna do a little stand-up thing there and just it'll just be fun I'm just it'll be real cool I got the guys that open for me the Davison brothers they're gonna do a couple songs they're real they're really good and just I don't know I've been this has been like through all the [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10419.3s)]
*  stress and chaos of the last however many months of things going on and stuff being rearranged and all this has been like my beacon that I've held on to of like we just got to get to the mothership and then that's everything a workout you know and well we've been really looking forward to having you everyone and the staff all the comics are real pumped everybody's excited I just couldn't believe the reception I got like even when I came with Tom that first time just how everybody sort of took me in like like I don't know I'm just sort of the well also a lot of people don't even know who I am because all they've seen of me is like just the internet stuff [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10449.3s)]
*  and all the political stuff and so it was really surprising the first time even we went to that mothership how I don't know just everybody there just was like very respectful and like and it just kind of like welcoming with open arms I kind of I thought I was going in there like really like kind of an outsider and it was way more receptive than I've ever been in Nashville you know like with music people yeah they just I don't know like William Montgomery and all those guys are just so so nice and so just like you know [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10479.3s)]
*  you know they're funny and they can make you laugh up on stage but even in person they're all just like really good people like they're all just really genuinely good people you know yeah we've got a great tribe yeah it's a great tribe and the the whole mentality of the club is like that like everybody that's there is cool you know we've really I think in comedy comedy still there's a lot of struggle in comedy for people to make it I think even more so than in music like that some of those people were telling me stories about like how tough it is to go out you know trying to make a make trying to make a career [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10509.3s)]
*  out of comedy like I guess unless you get a big Netflix special or you get a big break like it's paycheck to paycheck for a long time maybe for some of those guys like until they get or until they get to where they're like a regular at a big club like that you're just you're just off you know you're out you're out putting yourself into a very vulnerable position a lot where people can just say oh screw that guy you know it's just but you have to do that to get good at it but I think I think they have some appreciation for it that maybe other people don't like they're like it like I think that's I pick up on that like they get this [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10539.3s)]
*  everybody in there is struggling trying to make it and have put a lot of their heart and effort into it and it just seems like it's there's a lot of respect in there for each for everybody and stuff yeah 100% everybody realizes that there's only one way to do it you got to work hard for a long time it's the only way it's one of the few things in life that there's no shortcut to developing material and getting good at stand-up it's a 10-year process it's a 10-year degree you want to actually become a real stand-up it's probably about 10 years 10 years of grinding and for a lot of people like oh [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10569.3s)]
*  that's too long it is too long yeah that's why most people don't do it yeah but if you could do it the people that are doing it and have been doing it for like 10 plus years like all those people hanging out in the green room they're all so cool it's a lot like jujitsu in that regard it's like people that appreciate the difficulty of something and are really obsessed with getting better at it you know and obsessed with helping other people get better at it too because also like jujitsu the more people that you have around you that are really funny the funnier you'll get mm-hmm everybody has to be sharp because the whole show it like sometimes I'll do these Joe Rogan [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10599.3s)]
*  and Friends show and it's fucking a son of mod Brian Simpson Tony Hinchcliffe Shane Gillis Mark Norman and then I go up like it's like the show's an hour and a half old before I even get on stage yeah so it's like you have to stay sharp you have to and if you're not you got to pick up the slack you got to figure it out get back to the laptop let's go you got to rewrite do this do that but that's what we're all doing you know we're all it's a it's a vibrant place that there's the there's a mindset attached to that place it's very [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10629.3s)]
*  positive yeah that makes me real happy and I'm real happy that you're gonna be there this week yeah I think yeah I think this mothership thing's got a long future ahead of it in that sense of like just reshaping I don't know I just say it's like a it is kind of a beacon right now and a like I don't know it's like there's a big light shining up in the sky and every that's kind of where everybody's looking it seems like in that you know it's a and even with kill Tony it's just cool that they that's the coolest part about that is that it's like you can just go right in there anybody can go right in there and give it their all you know [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10659.3s)]
*  for better for worse like you might make it look you might be William Montgomery you know you might be Cam Patterson you might be Hans Kim or any of these people that have like legitimate careers now because of that show yeah it's pretty awesome Oliver Anthony this weekend sorry everybody it's all sold out you're not gonna be able to get in but I'm fucking pumped I can't wait yes and we say thank you for being here man and thanks for the podcast was a lot of fun thank you yeah I really enjoyed it very much and it's great to see you find your place man you're getting it you got it you know like you're you're here now [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10689.3s)]
*  you're established the beginning like what the fuck is happening now you like you got a plan it was so many pitfalls and so many things but it's a it's a conch it's a contribution of I'd say you know like at the very beginning you Jamie Johnson David Kushner and just a couple people who were like had been in it for a while and were able to well with David you know he was fairly recent but we were both but just those people just being able to guide me along at the first six months was when I could have really slipped up hard and like could have just I just was so thankful that I got [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmR9wnz1-yg&t=10719.3s)]
