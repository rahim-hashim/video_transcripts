# Joe Rogan Experience #2149 - Sebastian Maniscalco
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC9svktwGng)
*  Hello sir Austin.
*  What a joke.
*  It's my first time here at the Austin property.
*  Yes.
*  And first of all, most comfortable chair I've ever sat on.
*  They're great, right?
*  I feel like when I come here or when I come to this podcast, it's my third time on it.
*  I feel like I'm in the future.
*  All right.
*  I feel like you got things that aren't even out yet.
*  Right.
*  I just feel like this chair, the general public can't even have access to it.
*  No, but they do.
*  We've had these for years.
*  Whatever they are.
*  These are great.
*  Then I feel like I've never, I never drank water out of.
*  Metal cup?
*  Yeah.
*  I feel like I'm not comfortable here.
*  I feel like there's a reason for everything that you do.
*  There's definitely a reason for metal cups.
*  You really shouldn't be drinking out of plastic.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Again.
*  I mean I do.
*  I drink a plastic water bottle.
*  Someone gives me one, but I avoid them whenever I can.
*  Yeah.
*  Of course we all know all the plastics.
*  I'm drinking out of plastic bottles myself and I don't know.
*  I don't see that much of a.
*  It's going to turn you into a chick.
*  Maybe.
*  Is this even real water?
*  What kind of water is this?
*  It's filtered.
*  All right.
*  Filtered water.
*  Yeah.
*  What is it like?
*  It's a super filter.
*  Some crazy filter.
*  Definitely a special machine that's.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't get this water outside this room.
*  You can't get the water outside the room.
*  Good water, right?
*  It's very delicious.
*  And then you got a whole.
*  I don't know if anybody's ever talked about your area on your side of the table.
*  Yeah.
*  There's just so much shit going on over there.
*  There's tins.
*  There's.
*  Mammoth teeth.
*  I got an arrowhead, a legit arrowhead.
*  It's probably 500,000 years old.
*  You got soil on your bookshelf out there.
*  Yes.
*  I've never seen anybody jar soil.
*  Well, that was from a gentleman who runs White Oaks Pastures.
*  His name is Will Harris.
*  And he has this amazing farm.
*  It's a regenerative farm.
*  And he gave us two pieces of soil.
*  Was that Carl Barking?
*  He wants a fight.
*  He didn't get enough biting me this morning.
*  One more out first.
*  Carl's getting hard, dude.
*  He bit my finger.
*  That was a real yipe that I.
*  He bit me this morning.
*  I was like, yo.
*  Carl goes after you.
*  No, yeah.
*  You went after me.
*  But anyway, that soil, one of them is a jar of regenerative soil, which means soil that
*  is how a farm is supposed to be run, where there's manure and chickens and all the animals
*  just ruminate and they live off the land in a natural way.
*  And it's a deep, rich, dark soil.
*  And the other soil, which is pale, that's industrial soil.
*  That's soil that's been used with industrial fertilizers.
*  The top soil's dead.
*  And it's just garbage, which is most of what we eat.
*  See, the difference between you and I is you actually remember what the soil does and what
*  is somebody gave me soil.
*  Somebody gave me soil.
*  And you said you got soil.
*  I guess, yeah, somebody gave me dirt.
*  And I would know the difference between the two.
*  You see, the dark dirt is the good dirt.
*  That's the real dirt.
*  Dirt's supposed to look out in the wild.
*  That's what we're supposed to be eating food from.
*  Mineral rich soil so you get healthy vegetables, healthy animals.
*  That's beautiful that you have that on display.
*  And again, coming and taking a tour of this place is inspiring.
*  You make me want to spend money.
*  He should spend money.
*  You definitely should spend money.
*  Because if you don't spend money, what's the point in having it?
*  I know.
*  I wish I could get there.
*  But you...
*  Look at that watch.
*  You're balling.
*  Look at that thing.
*  What is that?
*  My wife gave me this.
*  That's a beautiful watch.
*  What is that?
*  It's a Cartier watch for our wedding.
*  That's gorgeous.
*  Let me see that.
*  That's a pretty watch.
*  That is a lovely watch.
*  Thank you, Joe.
*  I appreciate it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, she gave me this for our wedding gift.
*  Very nice.
*  But yeah.
*  Watch got taste.
*  Obviously.
*  You handsome bastard.
*  She got a lot more taste than I do.
*  I tell you that right now.
*  I know.
*  Yeah.
*  I let my wife pick out almost everything.
*  When I have nice sneakers on, it's generally my wife bottom.
*  Does your wife comment on your clothing?
*  She does, but she leaves me alone for the most part.
*  But she'll dress me occasionally if I have to go out.
*  But I'm basically a fucking teenager.
*  Yeah.
*  You look like a T-shirt, like a jujitsu T-shirt guy.
*  I wear T-shirts.
*  Yeah.
*  They're comfortable.
*  I wear jeans.
*  They're comfortable.
*  I don't really give a fuck.
*  I don't think I've ever seen you in a suit.
*  I wear suits.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I have some nice suits.
*  I have David August made me a whole ... I have a whole row in my office.
*  I'm in my house, my closet filled with suits.
*  Yeah, I got a bunch of custom made suits.
*  Because I can't wear regular suits.
*  I don't fit in them.
*  There's not a lot of 200 pound 5'8 dudes.
*  Just very odd shaped ...
*  They don't make clothing.
*  Chimp sizes.
*  Short dudes.
*  Chimpanzee collection.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's a nice fitted suit.
*  It's a fucking wonderful thing to have.
*  Because it just fits you perfect.
*  All the cuffs and everything.
*  You feel different.
*  You put it on.
*  All the boys ... We did a show in Vegas.
*  We did the MGM, the Grand Garden Arena.
*  And we did me and Brian Simpson, Tony Hinchcliffe and Hans Kim.
*  And I got them all suits.
*  I said, let's all get ... We're doing Vegas.
*  Come on, let's do it Rat Pack style.
*  So we got some of these beautiful David August suits.
*  Jamie got one too.
*  It was incredible.
*  Nice.
*  It was so much fun.
*  Yeah.
*  It's nice.
*  You feel different when you show up with a suit on.
*  You do feel different.
*  However, I ...
*  Look at that.
*  That's us.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Come on, son.
*  That's a nice shot.
*  Sharp.
*  Sharp.
*  Everybody's looking sharp.
*  Look at Jamie with the shades.
*  Come on.
*  I got the full pulp fiction ponytail going on.
*  Look at you.
*  Nice, right?
*  I feel though, with a suit, and I've noticed this as I've gained some weight in the mid
*  section, wearing a suit is becoming extremely uncomfortable if you don't have a very tight
*  body.
*  Right.
*  If you get stuck around here, it binds you.
*  Tuck in the shirt.
*  There's the buttons hanging off.
*  I'm fluctuating in my weight, where the suits I got right now, I got to work into them.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you and me are both Italian, and Italians, we just love our pasta.
*  It's a real problem.
*  It's a problem, especially after you hit 50.
*  It just seems to not go away.
*  It doesn't go away.
*  The only way to go away is to not eat pasta.
*  That's the only way.
*  That's the only way for me.
*  Not eat pasta and booze.
*  If I cut way back in the booze and no pasta, my body just goes, and triples back to normal.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm in the process of trying to get back.
*  It's so hard to avoid that food.
*  The food is just like, if it's in front of me, I just have a real problem.
*  Well, you like to eat meat.
*  Do you find that the meat is helping your physique?
*  Yeah, if I just eat meat, yeah, definitely.
*  Yeah, because meat is very satisfying.
*  Meat has what's called a high satiety rate, which means when you eat it, you get satisfied
*  when your body's had enough.
*  But I always say this, if you gave me a steak, just a steak, 16-ounce steak, I eat it, I'm
*  good.
*  I don't need anything else.
*  But if there's a bowl of pasta next to that steak, I'm eating the pasta too.
*  If there's some bread and butter, I'm going to eat the bread and butter.
*  Somebody rolls out dessert, of course I'll have dessert.
*  Next thing you know, I've consumed 1,500 extra calories that I didn't even really want or
*  I didn't want to eat.
*  You just get addicted to just stuffing your face, just stuff.
*  Oh, if I don't leave like this, like, oh, my stomach literally will distend out where
*  I look at myself in the mirror, I'm disgusted.
*  Like what have you eaten?
*  Look at all the mass you put in your body.
*  Because if you looked at like, we keep your stomach like right here, this is normal, my
*  normal stomach.
*  But if you add that much food, which is I'll consume that much food, easy, it just goes
*  right here.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, and you just look at you like, you fat piece of shit.
*  You lazy, slovenly, greedy fuck.
*  Like look what you've eaten.
*  You get any, you sweat at night when you sleep after you have meat?
*  I'm drenched.
*  I have a thing called an eight sleep mattress cover.
*  I have one.
*  They're fucking amazing.
*  To game changer.
*  Okay, so do you crank that thing up to 10 after you eat a meal like that to cool off
*  the body?
*  No, generally, if I'm sweating, it's because I'm having nightmares.
*  You know, I'll have some nightmares and I'll wake up drenched.
*  Not in that thing, though.
*  That thing generally, I don't think I have woken up sweaty since I got it.
*  Really?
*  I always used to wake up sweaty.
*  I would wake up at wet sheets.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  No, I eat a rib-eye.
*  Two o'clock in the morning I get up and I'm like sweating.
*  And that never used to happen when I used to eat.
*  I don't remember what I have the eight sleep thing dialed into, but I got it right there
*  at the sweet spot.
*  I've tried it a little too cool, a little too warm, but now I got it right there.
*  I sleep like a baby.
*  Do you have it heat up in the morning?
*  I think it does.
*  I think it's on some sort of a cycle.
*  I'm not exactly sure.
*  I don't remember how I set it up, but there's a bunch of different options that you can
*  do and you can even have a different option for you or your wife if she likes it warmer
*  or cooler.
*  It's nice.
*  No, it's been a game changer for me.
*  It does make a big difference.
*  Yeah.
*  But taking care of your sleep is just, I've really prioritized that, especially recently,
*  because owning the club and being out late and I was doing two shows a night, which is
*  also a lot.
*  It was too much.
*  I was doing six hours of comedy a week, just doing three nights, just doing Tuesday, Wednesday,
*  Thursday, two shows a night.
*  But it was just, I was too tired.
*  I was burnt out.
*  And I wasn't getting the proper sleep because I'd get home, shows over, like 12, 30 or something
*  like that.
*  I'd get home, hanging out with the guys at the club.
*  I'd get home at like 1.30 and then I'd start writing.
*  And so I write from 1.30 to like 4 and then I have to get up at 10 to work out.
*  I'm like, this is too much.
*  I'm too tired.
*  You're writing material in the dead of night?
*  Yeah, that's my right.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  I almost always find that I'm most productive when everyone in my house is asleep.
*  So I don't have to like, dad, I don't have to think about anything.
*  Did you do this?
*  Did you put that away?
*  Where's the thing?
*  I don't have to deal with anything.
*  The dog's asleep.
*  Everybody's cool.
*  I can just sit in front of that fucking computer and think.
*  And that's the only time that I have like free reign in my house where there's no one
*  awake.
*  So I get my best.
*  And also, I think you're jazzed up when you get off stage.
*  And if you just hold on to that, like your brain is already kind of in comedy mode.
*  Your brain is already thinking.
*  Yeah.
*  I, for me, I do a voice message.
*  I record the set and I'll listen to it afterwards.
*  But as far as like creating, I mean, I don't know.
*  I feel like after 10 o'clock, the whole body shuts down.
*  And I got two small kids.
*  So maybe that's why, you know, they're up early.
*  Sure, they're up early.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, I mean, 9, 30, 10, there's this.
*  And talk about the two shows.
*  I mean, I used to do two shows with my eyes closed.
*  And now it's like the second show.
*  It's like, hey.
*  Are you taking vitamins?
*  I take supplements like, you know, multivitamin.
*  I'm sure I don't have it dialed in.
*  You should get it dialed in.
*  It'll make a big difference.
*  As much as it should be.
*  But I just feel exhausted, Joe.
*  I am tired.
*  Yeah.
*  And I just constantly have to have sips of caffeine throughout the day to stay alive.
*  Oh.
*  That's where I'm at.
*  You look like you wake up ready to go.
*  I got this whole vision of what your day must look like.
*  You must spring out of bed and go, give me it.
*  Right.
*  I never talk about not having a suit on.
*  I don't think since I've known you, I've seen you yawn.
*  Dude.
*  Kid, bro.
*  You constantly look awake.
*  What is it?
*  It's health.
*  The water?
*  It's all the above.
*  Supplements, definitely.
*  That's a big factor.
*  I take a lot of vitamins.
*  I take athletic greens.
*  That's one thing I take.
*  But I take a whole suite of different vitamins.
*  I take a bunch of different things like vitamin D, vitamin K2.
*  I take things for eyesight.
*  I take just fish oil.
*  I take creatine.
*  I take a lot of stuff.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  I took three or four vitamins once.
*  I swallowed it with some water.
*  I coughed and a puff of white smoke came out of my mouth.
*  Vitamin powder.
*  Yeah.
*  I think the body's rejecting the vitamins.
*  You got it.
*  It's got to be a slow process.
*  You don't want to dive right into the amount of vitamins.
*  The amount of vitamins I take is like half of this coffee cup.
*  Jeez.
*  Every day.
*  All right.
*  Yeah.
*  Taking a couple.
*  I have like a whole cabinet that's filled with supplements when I pull them out.
*  So when you travel, what do you carry?
*  Carry a suitcase of supplements?
*  I have a bag.
*  And in my bag, most of the time when I travel, there's a company called Pure Encapsulations
*  and they make these packs, like Athletic Pure Pack.
*  They're great for travel.
*  It's very easy.
*  You don't have to think about it.
*  Just rip open the pack, take those vitamins and you're good.
*  So when I'm on the road, generally.
*  You getting rid of Carl?
*  Is he too rowdy?
*  I don't know what's wrong with him.
*  He's rowdy.
*  He wants to bite me.
*  He's teething.
*  He's biting.
*  How cute is that dog?
*  He's cute.
*  I just bought a dog.
*  I just got a dog.
*  I've never had a dog owner in my life.
*  Really?
*  It's the first time I've ever had a dog.
*  It's a Labradoodle.
*  Oh, those are great dogs.
*  It's extremely intelligent.
*  Yeah.
*  But I don't think it likes me.
*  What?
*  I don't know.
*  It's looking at me like, it loves my wife, loves my kids.
*  It doesn't like you.
*  I don't know.
*  It's not as excited to see me as maybe my wife and kids.
*  Really?
*  And it's very perceptive on the...
*  Maybe he wants to meet a man.
*  Is he the man of the house?
*  Well, he's becoming the man.
*  Does he have balls?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, keep his balls.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't.
*  No.
*  That's what one of the dog trainers said.
*  Just keep them nuts and tight.
*  Yeah.
*  The whole idea is you don't want unnecessary puppies.
*  Right.
*  I agree.
*  Don't let your dog breed.
*  But be with your fucking dog.
*  But if you take your dog's balls off, now your dog doesn't have any testosterone anymore.
*  They develop hip problems and joint problems.
*  They're tired all the time.
*  Just like a man.
*  If you take his balls away, they become a eunuch.
*  That's what you're doing to your dog.
*  Okay.
*  And it's just...
*  I've seen people do it and they're like, oh my...
*  I wish I didn't do it.
*  Like, Andrew Huberman said that.
*  He started giving his dog testosterone because he gave his dog...
*  He got his dog fixed and then his dog was like listless all the time.
*  And so he's like...
*  He felt terrible.
*  And they started doing the research on it and looking into it and like, oh, you need
*  hormones.
*  Dogs do just like people do.
*  It's terrible for them.
*  Yeah.
*  We'll keep his nuts intact.
*  I had a vet that told me that.
*  One vet, a great guy.
*  And he was like, don't do it.
*  Everybody says to do it.
*  Like, you're not taking your dog somewhere and letting your dog breed with a bunch of
*  different dogs and have puppies just that...irresponsibly.
*  So your dog has a nice yard.
*  You're a good dog owner.
*  You're with them all the time.
*  Like, don't worry about it.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't do it.
*  As long as you're paying attention to them.
*  Yeah.
*  The whole idea is just to not...
*  I mean, people are irresponsible.
*  I can't go to the dog pound.
*  If I go to the dog pound, I will have 20 dogs.
*  My dog's perfect.
*  He's awesome.
*  But I just...I love dogs.
*  I would have.
*  You've had them?
*  Yeah.
*  I always had dogs.
*  I would have as many dogs as I can.
*  I love them.
*  They're just pure love.
*  And if you have a good relationship with your dogs, if your dogs love you and you love them,
*  it's like every day I wake up and I say to my dog, good morning, sir.
*  And he goes, woo.
*  He starts whimpering and whining and wagging his tail 50 miles an hour.
*  And he goes around in circles.
*  And we hug it out.
*  And I kiss him.
*  And I rub his belly.
*  It's like we have a morning ritual.
*  I love dogs, man.
*  Oh, that's nice.
*  It's nice to have a ritual.
*  It changes your life.
*  They make your life filled with love.
*  You know, cats are cool.
*  But they're kind of aloof.
*  You know, they want to be pet.
*  And then they go away.
*  And they're cool.
*  They just want to go outside and kill something.
*  Your dog is like your friend.
*  He wants to hang out with you.
*  Like, I take him to work.
*  He's like, are we going to work?
*  This is crazy.
*  Every day when I bring out the ball, I think he's going to be bored with the ball.
*  I bring out the balls like today.
*  He's like enough with the ball.
*  But nope.
*  Every day is like the fucking ball.
*  He's got the ball.
*  He's running around circles jumping up in the air trying to steal the ball from me before
*  I throw it.
*  It's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  That's that's what I hear a lot of dog owners.
*  You're not having that experience.
*  Well, not yet.
*  Not how old is he?
*  Puppies like three, three months old.
*  Just spend time with him.
*  And I want to play with him a lot.
*  I'm playing.
*  I'm just saying I'm not interested.
*  I don't know if it's the cologne I got on.
*  But I always smell horrible.
*  What the hell is this?
*  You probably smell like a chemical factory.
*  What the fuck is this dude smell like?
*  Whoo.
*  I feel I feel I feel do you work alone?
*  I feel like you don't work alone.
*  Do you work alone?
*  What do you mean?
*  Do you work alone?
*  Wear cologne?
*  Yeah.
*  I thought you said work alone.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  No, I don't work alone.
*  No, I barely wear.
*  I only wear deodorant because I don't want to be offensive because I will get offensive.
*  I'll smell terrible.
*  But I wear natural deodorant with no aluminum in it and all that chest.
*  Of course you do.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't have I don't I don't smell.
*  You don't smell at all?
*  No.
*  Are you sure?
*  Can I smell you?
*  Go right ahead.
*  How could you not smell?
*  I don't I don't have whatever it is that gives off any type of body odor.
*  Really?
*  I don't have it.
*  Have you been told this by someone or you just like deduced this on your own?
*  I've gotten sweaty many a times and I've asked my wife, do I smell?
*  She says no.
*  So I don't I don't emanate any odor while I'm sweating.
*  Interesting.
*  Maybe your wife can't smell good.
*  No, I'm telling you, Joe.
*  Believe me, I'm very keen on odors.
*  All right.
*  So if I smell anything, I make sure that that's taken care of.
*  Odors are interesting because you know, your your olfactory senses, they detect changes
*  in smell.
*  They don't detect static smells.
*  That's why people that live in an area like with a slaughterhouse, they don't freak out.
*  Like my family used to live in Pennsylvania.
*  And when I would drive from New York to go visit them, when I would drive through these
*  areas where they have farms and slaughterhouses, fertilizer, it's fucking terrible smell in
*  the whole town.
*  Like how can these people live here?
*  They don't smell it.
*  Oh, the no body odor gene.
*  That's what you have.
*  People have the ABCC 11 non-functioning gene variant have dry earwax and little to no body
*  odor.
*  Now, I've known this for some time that I have no body odor.
*  But it's nice to come on the show because there's always a reference put up.
*  Like I could have looked that up.
*  I never looked it up.
*  And here you come and you walk away knowing that you don't have the gene that emits odor.
*  Yeah, some sort of a gene expression.
*  Interesting.
*  I wonder what the benefits.
*  We were talking about this yesterday, like people that didn't shower.
*  There was people that went their whole life without bathing because bathing was considered
*  a sin.
*  It was sinful.
*  You want to discourage people.
*  Where was that about that we're reading?
*  It was something religious, right?
*  It was about like royalty and old timey people.
*  St. Agnes, is that who it was that went his whole life without bathing at all?
*  His whole life, no bathing.
*  I couldn't imagine that.
*  Imagine what that guy smelled like.
*  Imagine what his asshole smelled like.
*  What the fuck, dude?
*  Have you gone recently in the last 10 years without taking a shower or cleaning yourself
*  at least?
*  Did you miss a day?
*  I've missed a day before.
*  Yeah.
*  But generally no, because I work out.
*  So if I work out, I always shower.
*  And I'll cold plunge in sauna.
*  So you just drench this way.
*  You feel like shit if you don't wash off a little.
*  No, I agree.
*  I think I might be showering too much.
*  How much do you shower?
*  Well, I normally get two showers in a day.
*  Really?
*  Sometimes three.
*  Interesting.
*  I feel like if I'm going to go to dinner, say with my wife, I feel like I can't take
*  the day shower and bleed it into the night.
*  I feel like it's a reset.
*  You get re-ready for the dinner.
*  You want to look nice?
*  You want to feel nice?
*  Put that watch on?
*  Put the watch on.
*  Go out and have a nice bowl of pasta.
*  Sweat to death until the fucking morning.
*  Do you use the eight sleep thing?
*  Does it help you?
*  Well it's, again, I got this eight sleep.
*  It's supposed to monitor your sleep.
*  I got the aura ring.
*  It's supposed to monitor.
*  You know what I need?
*  I need accountability.
*  I need to send the data to someone.
*  And have someone change your lifestyle.
*  And have them analyze it and go, oh, you know what the problem is?
*  You're waking up at one o'clock in the morning and that's disrupting your sleep.
*  I got all this data.
*  I got an Apple Watch.
*  Oh, I burned 390 calories.
*  Okay.
*  What does that mean?
*  You know, like, there's no ... I have a lot of data.
*  I don't have a lot of analysis.
*  All right?
*  Do you have a trainer?
*  I have a trainer, yeah.
*  Maybe we should get a nutritionist.
*  You got some bread.
*  Get a nutritionist.
*  Get someone who you can show the data to and they'll tell you what you're doing wrong.
*  All right.
*  I need someone to hand over the data to them.
*  They have companies that do stuff like that.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, you can get that done.
*  Yeah.
*  You should do that.
*  Yeah, I bet the late night eating thing's a real problem.
*  That one makes you feel terrible when you're sleeping.
*  What's late night eating?
*  Okay, like, some say, all right, you should have dinner at 5.30, 6 o'clock, and after
*  that you don't eat if you go to bed around 9, 9.30.
*  I mean, what's a late night meal for you?
*  At one o'clock in the morning last night I was cooking elk steaks.
*  One o'clock in the morning.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you go to ... Well, then you're up till 4.30.
*  I was up till three.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, as long as you're not going to sleep, I figure out two, three hours ... I think
*  two, three hours is a good time to go to bed after a meal like that.
*  Yeah, a couple hours.
*  Yeah.
*  But I've done it like where I eat and then go right to bed.
*  That's terrible.
*  That's terrible.
*  That's what I'm like.
*  We have eight o'clock at night.
*  We're eating.
*  Next thing you know, 8.41, we're in bed.
*  And I'm like, is this healthy?
*  So I ...
*  You should go for a walk.
*  Go for a walk around your neighborhood.
*  I just saw something online that's walking ...
*  I was going to share that.
*  Oh, who's that?
*  Huberman Lab.
*  Oh, yeah, there it is.
*  That's from Andrew Huberman again.
*  Brief post meal walks and blood sugar regulation.
*  So they explain the simple yet large positive effect that a brief post meal walk, as simple
*  as it may sound, the date is impressive.
*  And it is impressive stuff.
*  I forget exactly what the numbers were, but 30, 35 percent, the change in your blood sugar
*  level is by taking a walk around the block after a meal.
*  Pretty amazing.
*  With all this stuff that's out, all this information of how to live your life.
*  And you took me to a tour.
*  You got the ... You got the tank, the sauna, the thing.
*  I feel like at this age, at 50, all the stuff that you got to do to prepare for the day,
*  by the time you're done with it, you got to go back to bed again.
*  So by the time you work out, do the cold plunge, you're in the sauna, you're in the tank, and
*  then it's time to go to bed.
*  It's time to go back to bed with all the shit you got to do.
*  It used to be you just work out for an hour, you took a shower, and you went on with your
*  day.
*  Now I got to go submerge myself in water.
*  I got to go sweat.
*  Then I got to go float in a tank.
*  The tank takes a lot of time, but the other things don't take ... The float tank takes
*  a lot of time.
*  But the other things like cold plunge adds three minutes to my day.
*  Sauna adds 20 minutes to my day.
*  It's 25 extra minutes of my workout.
*  That's it.
*  No.
*  I wasn't looking for the time breakdown, Joe.
*  I was just saying ...
*  But it doesn't take the whole day.
*  But I'm just saying the amount of ... Then you got to eat the vitamins, the half a cup.
*  But it's all said and done.
*  It's time for dinner.
*  No.
*  No.
*  You get things done, man.
*  You're exaggerating.
*  I get you doing that.
*  I don't ...
*  It's the way you do humor.
*  I get it.
*  I don't have to exaggerate.
*  There's plenty of time.
*  There's plenty of time.
*  You just don't waste ... Today, I wasted an hour just scrolling through Instagram.
*  It was one of the rare days I just felt like indulging myself.
*  I'm like, let's fucking see what's going on in the world.
*  Bunch of nonsense.
*  Some interesting things.
*  But just a bunch of nonsense for a whole hour just wasted scrolling.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there's time.
*  There's mind numbing things that you do to kind of like whatever, carry yourself throughout
*  the day.
*  I'm just saying 20 years ago, nobody knew about any of this shit about what you did.
*  Sweating and what that does.
*  Now with the internet, you could throw up ... Before the internet, if we were talking
*  about walking, we would just go, oh yeah, now walk is good for you.
*  Next thing you know, now we got a whole study up on the screen of how walking is beneficial
*  to you and this, that, and the other thing.
*  I'm just saying with the amount of information out there, sometimes I feel a little bit overwhelmed
*  going, how much do I gotta do to get through the day?
*  Well, it depends on how you want to feel.
*  If you want to have a lot of energy like I do, you have to do a lot of things.
*  I firmly believe that's the reason why I'm so productive.
*  I think if I didn't do the cold plunge and the sauna and the workouts and the vitamins
*  and the eating healthy, I'd be a completely different human being.
*  I know.
*  That's why I thought ... I wouldn't have the energy.
*  No, I get it.
*  There's a lot you gotta do.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot you gotta do.
*  I see people on the internet sweating.
*  I'm like, okay, do I gotta start sweating?
*  Is the steam room that I got at home, is that not enough?
*  Do a couple eucalyptus sprays, breathe in, sweat a little bit, and then I come out.
*  That's not bad.
*  Okay, but now do I need an infrared sauna because now I gotta get the sweat that's inside
*  that's not coming out of the steam?
*  What's happening, Joe?
*  The infrared sauna is probably very good for you, but there's not a lot of data on it like
*  there is with the traditional dry sauna.
*  A traditional dry sauna, there's a lot of very beneficial data.
*  The thing about the difference between steam and sauna is you can't really get steam hot
*  enough because you'll cook because it's just too crazy.
*  You can't get a 190 degree steam shower.
*  You'd literally go in there and scald your skin, but you can get a 190 degree dry sauna
*  and you go in there and you really fucking sweat.
*  That's when your body develops all those heat shock proteins because your body is reacting
*  to it overheating, so it has to do something to mitigate that effect.
*  That effect of mitigating it is what's so beneficial for your life.
*  There's a study out of Finland, they did a 20 year study that found that using the sauna
*  four times a week for 20 minutes at a time, and I think it was 175 degrees, lowers your
*  all cause mortality by 40%.
*  That means strokes, heart attack, cancer, everything, lowers it by 40%, and this is
*  a long term study of many, many people.
*  So the 190 degrees is a lot more beneficial than the steam.
*  The steam at 120, is that doing anything?
*  It's doing something.
*  Yeah, it's all good.
*  A hot bath is good.
*  Everything is good.
*  Getting your body to heat up is good because it gets your body to react and it's the same
*  thing.
*  It develops those heat shock proteins.
*  A really hot bath is very good for you.
*  If you can get in a nice hot, especially if you get some Epsom salts in there, you get
*  that magnesium, you get a really hot bath, very, very good for you.
*  You know what I started doing?
*  Talking about magnesium.
*  And I don't know if you've ever done this, but I'm doing a...
*  I got a little spray bottle of magnesium.
*  I spray it on my feet at night and I put socks on.
*  You ever heard of that move?
*  No.
*  Why do you do that?
*  Saw it online.
*  Look at that.
*  Let me try this.
*  I'm a guy, I'll tell you right now, this is what I do.
*  I don't do research.
*  None?
*  None.
*  I see that.
*  I go, oh, this guy sprayed it in the magnesium, I was putting socks on.
*  I'm going to try that tonight.
*  That's it.
*  No Google search?
*  No Google search, no nothing.
*  Okay.
*  It could be killing me for all I know.
*  I don't think it is.
*  But I'm doing magnesium feet sock sleeps.
*  Does it seem to have a change in the way you feel?
*  Again, haven't done it consistently enough to even find out if this is helping me.
*  Right.
*  I'm a guy that does things kind of on the whim and there's really no consistency with
*  it.
*  Let's look into it for you because the magnesium foot spray, now I'm interested.
*  What is the deal behind that?
*  There's definitely multiple products being sold as magnesium oil for your feet.
*  I didn't see anything necessarily saying you need to keep socks on too.
*  I throw the socks on just because I don't want magnesium all over the bed.
*  That's a good move.
*  That's what I'm doing.
*  My wife is even looking at me going, Jesus Christ, this is where we're at.
*  I'm at the edge of the bed spraying my feet.
*  She's like, really?
*  Magnesium on your feet?
*  Is this where the relationship is?
*  So I don't know if you could...
*  The internet probably don't even have this information.
*  I saw it on a random, I think it was an Instagram video.
*  I would imagine it gets absorbed through your skin just like the float tank does.
*  The float tank is a great source of magnesium because there's a thousand pounds of epsom
*  salts in the water and your skin absorbs it.
*  So I would imagine your skin is absorbing that stuff you're spraying on your feet.
*  Yeah, it just doesn't absorb it as well as an oral supplement.
*  That's about all it says.
*  Not good absorption, but it works a little bit.
*  Pull something.
*  It can help with cramps or some sort of nerve functions.
*  Magnesium helps people sleep though, right?
*  It's a good one for sleep.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I notice sometimes when I get those IV and there's magnesium in there, I feel exhausted.
*  Relaxed.
*  Relaxed.
*  The IV, again, this is another thing people do.
*  Right.
*  Oh, you got to get a bag of whatever the hell's in the thing.
*  I don't even ask.
*  I just, give me the bag.
*  Whatever you...
*  And I get it, right?
*  Don't feel any different.
*  No?
*  You will if you're sick.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're...
*  I tell everybody, if you are down, if you're feeling shit and you're run down, get an IV
*  vitamin drip.
*  It's a game changer, especially with a high dose of zinc and vitamin C. You get an IV
*  vitamin bag and you will feel way better.
*  Bill Burr was sick as a dog when I saw him last.
*  I was like, how long you been sick for?
*  He's like, two weeks.
*  I can't shake this cold.
*  I go, please listen to me.
*  I just do this.
*  Get a vitamin IV.
*  And he texted me the other day.
*  He's like, Dr. Rogan.
*  He goes, it fixed me.
*  He's like, I'm going to do that from now on.
*  I'm like, from now on, anytime you're sick, you feel like shit, get a high dose vitamin
*  C, zinc, B12, the whole deal in a bag.
*  You'll feel much, much better because it gives your body the tools it needs to fight off
*  whatever the fuck is trying to get you.
*  Yeah, Joe, listen, I've done the bag.
*  Right?
*  While ill.
*  Has it helped?
*  Well, it's helped, but not like where I came out of it.
*  Like, this is what I'm thinking.
*  If I take the bag and I got a cough after I take the bag.
*  The cough should go away.
*  I don't want the cough anymore.
*  Right.
*  And if the cough is still there, I feel like, eh.
*  Have you ever done NAD?
*  No.
*  NAD is rough.
*  How do you say it again?
*  Nucleotide adenonide.
*  What is it again?
*  Nicotinonide.
*  Yeah.
*  Adeno.
*  Adenine.
*  Adenine dinucleotides.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  What is it?
*  So NAD is a supplement that you can take that actually helps your telomeres lengthen, which
*  is a sign of healthy bodies and young people.
*  NAD is called dinucleotide because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphorus
*  groups.
*  So you take that in an IV bag and generally most people do it over a long period of time.
*  You do it over like two hours.
*  So you just watch a movie because it's very uncomfortable.
*  What to get it?
*  Yeah.
*  The NAD is very uncomfortable.
*  It's very uncomfortable for your stomach.
*  It makes you like crap up.
*  Oh, OK.
*  If you do it quick, it's like it's an intense feeling that most people don't enjoy.
*  What's the benefit?
*  What does it do?
*  There's a lot of benefits.
*  There's a benefit for your immune system.
*  There's a benefit cognitively.
*  You feel much better.
*  You come out of it when your body's replenished with that stuff.
*  You just feel fantastic.
*  OK.
*  You feel really good.
*  That's something else I got to do.
*  But that's one that needs some time unless you can go hardcore and just like deal with
*  the uncomfortable feeling.
*  No, I don't do anything hardcore.
*  Nothing?
*  Nothing in my life is hardcore.
*  Interesting.
*  Interesting.
*  Do you have an aversion to hardcore things or is this how it all panned out?
*  It's just how it all panned out.
*  Hardcore for me is...
*  Hardcore is comedy.
*  That's what I do.
*  OK.
*  Yeah, one thing.
*  One thing where you're all in on.
*  All in on comedy.
*  But other than that, outside I wish I was more interested and dove into things a little
*  bit more deeper than I have.
*  Everything with me is a little bit on the surface.
*  Do you really wish that?
*  Because I feel like if you did wish that, you would just do it.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  I just wish I had the...
*  I don't know what it is inside me that would make me want to learn more about...
*  I like cooking, right?
*  But I don't dive so into it where I'm coming up with recipes and doing this and that and
*  the other thing.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Let's look at a YouTube video, make the fish and then here's the fish.
*  But I don't take it to another level.
*  I don't go get the beautiful knife or the pots and pans and all the stuff that goes
*  along with cooking.
*  My interest level is surface.
*  Rarely does it go underneath the surface.
*  You know what I really got into out here is cooking over wood.
*  Like live, like actual hardwood, not just lump charcoal, like getting wood and using
*  an offset smoker and slowly searing the steaks or slowly cooking the steaks rather and then
*  searing them at the end over the coals.
*  I take the coals and I put the coals from the hardwood underneath the grill and then
*  sear the shit out of it.
*  OK, I hear that.
*  I hear that.
*  Yeah.
*  And my brain is going to explode.
*  Like, it's...
*  Too much?
*  Too much.
*  But we're all different Sebastian.
*  No, I know we're all different, but like, do you know the kind of wood...
*  Yes.
*  That is...
*  Live oak.
*  You want oak, generally.
*  Live oak or you want, if you want to grill hotter, you like, a lot of guys like mesquite.
*  I like mesquite and oak.
*  Those are my two favorites, but I'll try cherry.
*  I'll try some different woods, some places you can go to get hardwood just for some...
*  Because there's so much barbecue out here.
*  Yeah.
*  There's companies that'll just deliver cords of wood to your house.
*  OK, speaking of wood, right?
*  I got a pizza oven.
*  My goal...
*  Nice.
*  ...is to make pizza.
*  It's not as easy as people might think to make pizza from scratch, the dough and the
*  whole thing.
*  No, it's very hard.
*  So, I've tried multiple times and, you know, I'm the guy...
*  Again, I'm a guy that...
*  I'll try it again and hope for a different result, but I'll do the same thing I did before.
*  Right.
*  Right?
*  Just hoping magically, oh, it's going to come out.
*  My pizza don't even look like pizza.
*  It looks like...
*  The shapes are unrecognizable.
*  All right?
*  I can't even get a circle on the damn thing.
*  To work...
*  You know, I work it out.
*  It's just...
*  It's not pliable enough.
*  So, when I put it in there, half of the cheese flies off into the stove.
*  I bring it out.
*  It's a mess.
*  Why don't you get pre-made dough?
*  You can get pre-made...
*  I tried the pre-made dough, Joe.
*  That didn't work either?
*  And for whatever the reason, I cannot get a circle with the thing.
*  You know, I tried this.
*  I bet if you went to a real Italian pizzeria, they would show you how to do it.
*  Again...
*  If you went there...
*  Joe, listen.
*  You teach me something, I come home, I forget half of the shit I learned.
*  I don't have any retention or comprehension on anything.
*  Has this always been the case?
*  It's always been the case.
*  But not with comedy?
*  Not with comedy.
*  That's why I went...
*  This is interesting.
*  The one thing that you're successful at, super successful at, you've focused entirely on that.
*  I got no more focus.
*  Oh.
*  The focus I have is for comedy.
*  After that, the focus wanes because I feel like I just don't have the focus.
*  That's probably a good way to live.
*  Yeah, just be casual most of your life and be intense about one thing.
*  That sounds like a good balance.
*  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
*  I would like to learn more things.
*  Even when you've got kids now, you could teach your kids how to do the archery.
*  You've got the whole archery thing.
*  Hunting.
*  I know how to hunt.
*  I'm trying to figure out what am I passing on to my kids as far as skill sets is concerned.
*  Yeah, I do that.
*  Probably talking shit.
*  Huh?
*  Talking shit.
*  They're probably good at talking shit.
*  My kids are real good at talking shit.
*  They say some funny things, man.
*  It's fun.
*  We have a fun house.
*  It's a lot of fun shit talking.
*  That's always good.
*  Then they make fun of me too, which is fun.
*  I could never make fun of my parents.
*  There was none of that growing up.
*  They would fucking yell at you.
*  We had that relationship with my parents.
*  Yeah, you can't be.
*  Italian parents.
*  No, no, we did.
*  Oh, you had a relationship joking around?
*  Yeah, just goofing around.
*  Oh, okay.
*  My parents were not like that.
*  No, they didn't.
*  There was not a lot of joking around.
*  No.
*  I love joking around.
*  They make it fun of me all the time.
*  It's hilarious.
*  Your daughters?
*  Yeah, they're funny.
*  They talk shit.
*  They know that I like it.
*  They know that I laugh, so everyone's like, we have a good time.
*  They talk shit to each other.
*  They talk shit to their friends.
*  Talking shit is fun.
*  It's a fun activity.
*  It's one of my favorite things about a green room at a comedy club is that everybody's
*  talking shit.
*  You go back there, everybody's busting balls, cracking on people, guys and girls.
*  Everyone's laughing.
*  We're all just shit on each other.
*  It's hilarious.
*  It's such a beautiful environment.
*  Like a green room of a comedy club where you're around a bunch of good people and everyone's
*  laughing and we're all jazzed up because we're about to do shows.
*  I wish you were in last night and I wanted to take you to the club.
*  I wish I would have came to the club.
*  It's so much fun, man.
*  It's such a great spot.
*  But here's my thing with that.
*  Okay.
*  Here's my take on the green room.
*  I generally tend to retreat and just listen to everything that's going on when comedians
*  get together.
*  I'm never the guy center of attention or contributing to the fun.
*  I've always been the guy that just kind of comes in quiet and listen because I don't
*  the comedians intimately enough to have that comfortable.
*  So if I walk into a room, like here, I just did the show with Seinfeld, Nate Bragazzi
*  and Jim Gaffigan and we're all backstage.
*  I tend to be the one who's ... I listen and I chime in every now and again.
*  I don't have to be the guy that comes in and kind of like pisses on the room going on.
*  That's actually good.
*  That's a good trait.
*  Yeah.
*  Also, when you're around those guys, like hey, what a great time to sit back and listen.
*  You got Seinfeld, Nate Bragazzi and Jim Gaffigan in a room together.
*  Look at that.
*  Yeah.
*  So we had a great time, but I'm just ...
*  When did ... That's crazy.
*  When did what?
*  I was going to say, like look at you.
*  You look like an Arab.
*  It doesn't even look like you.
*  When did you turn into a guy from Palestine?
*  I don't know.
*  What is that photo?
*  Two weeks ago.
*  Someone put a filter on you.
*  That does not look like you.
*  Am I right, Jamie?
*  That is dark.
*  No, no, no.
*  Dark.
*  The guy, he came off a yacht.
*  There's no other way.
*  Look, the squirrel ... Let's take a guy in the Mediterranean who shows you how to get
*  octopus.
*  What's that say?
*  I got Mediterranean blood.
*  I know, but you don't even look like you.
*  Like in that photo, you look handsome.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  You look great, but you don't look like you.
*  No, you know what it is.
*  Everybody else is white.
*  Yeah.
*  They got ... That's what it is.
*  Ah, super white.
*  When you're next to Jim Gaffigan, right?
*  Right, right, right.
*  Of course you're going to look like you're delivering fish.
*  That's the filter because he looks ...
*  There's a balance there, man.
*  He looks like a normal color in that, which is wrong.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at the dark here.
*  Well, that at least looks like you.
*  That other photo did not look like you.
*  All right.
*  Maybe it was the lighting, Joe, but that's me.
*  I was there.
*  I believe you.
*  I 100% believe you.
*  I'm just saying that.
*  Go to that last photo, Jamie.
*  I'm not lying.
*  Go to that last photo.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  That ain't you.
*  That's some dude that works for the Saudi Arabian government.
*  That's some dude that works for the Saudi Arabian government.
*  He came over here to make some sort of a deal to try to get comedy to come over to the Middle
*  East.
*  I know a lot of guys who do comedy in the Middle East, and they give you a list of shit
*  you can't talk about.
*  I did it in 08.
*  I went with a bunch of comedians.
*  That scares me.
*  A list of shit you can't talk about?
*  What if I slip up?
*  Yeah.
*  What if there's a moment in the crowd where someone yells something out, and I think it
*  would be funny to say something?
*  Whoopsies.
*  There's a lot of editing.
*  Now you're in jail.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Who had a problem with that?
*  Who was it?
*  Someone actually went to one of those Middle East countries and did a gig and almost got
*  arrested.
*  It was Eddie Ift.
*  The only thing that saved him, I believe the story was, I believe it's Eddie.
*  I think the only thing that saved him is some of the royal family thought he was hilarious.
*  They didn't have a problem with what he said at all.
*  I think he called someone sir when you're not supposed to call him sir.
*  You're supposed to call him your highness or your excellency.
*  He was referring to people in the audience and talking to them and calling them sir.
*  Then they were trying to arrest him afterwards.
*  Jeez.
*  Yeah.
*  Yo.
*  Sir's not good enough?
*  That's not even like, I thought it was something sexual.
*  No.
*  That's why I'm nervous.
*  That's not even anything crazy.
*  That's nothing.
*  Your brand of humor, did you take that and did you ever do corporates?
*  No.
*  That wasn't your style?
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  No.
*  They're always terrible.
*  You like them?
*  Yo, I gotta be honest.
*  You like them?
*  I don't mind a corporate.
*  Really?
*  I really don't mind a corporate.
*  Yeah.
*  You've had those awful corporate gigs where, you know.
*  What percentage of what?
*  I just ran into Sandler.
*  He told me he ate dick at a corporate gig.
*  Yeah.
*  Adam Sandler.
*  Yeah, they're not.
*  They paid to see Adam Sandler.
*  They knew Adam Sandler was going to be there and it still sucked.
*  It's the environment sometimes.
*  It's like you're walking into whatever.
*  They just had their breakout meeting and then they're coming and then, oh, it's comedy.
*  But it's just a different vibe.
*  They're all scamming about their careers.
*  They're all networking.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking making their little backstabbing moves.
*  But you call them out on that.
*  You kind of do material about what they're going through during the three-day sales meeting
*  at the Venetian.
*  Right.
*  So you kind of relate to it.
*  I don't mind them as much as other comedians.
*  Oh, I corporate this.
*  I actually don't mind them.
*  Jay Leno loves them.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's where he's made the majority of his money.
*  You know, Jay Leno, all those fucking cars he has, never spent a dime of his tonight
*  show money.
*  I know.
*  Never spent a dime.
*  Puts it all in the bank.
*  It's amazing.
*  All that money, all those cars, it's all him doing gigs.
*  Well, here, you didn't grow up with money.
*  Right?
*  Now you're super successful and you got this money.
*  Was there someone that taught you how to manage money or how to look at money in a way where
*  you're like, okay, I have a good grasp on this?
*  Yeah, I mean, money manager, what have you.
*  But I'm just talking to your relationship with money.
*  Is it like, yeah, you know, we're here, you know, live it up, spend it?
*  Or is it more like, do you ever think this is not going to be the most popular podcast
*  ever?
*  Or do you even think that way?
*  I don't think that way.
*  I never thought it would be popular in the first place.
*  When I first started doing it, there was just me and Brian Redband in my fucking living
*  room.
*  Like, and then comedians, Joey Diaz come over, Eddie Bravo comes over, Ari comes over.
*  We're just having fun.
*  Just talking shit.
*  I never imagined.
*  I didn't plan for it.
*  Like, when everybody has those vision boards, like, this is how you become successful.
*  You have to manifest it.
*  I didn't manifest this at all.
*  Zero.
*  I've never been successful thing I've ever done by a long shot.
*  And I've put zero management into it.
*  All I've done is just keep doing what I enjoy doing.
*  And it turns out other people enjoy it too.
*  That's it.
*  It's just talk to people like yourself, talk to funny people, talk to interesting people,
*  talk to people I agree with, talk to people I disagree with, have civil conversations
*  with people.
*  You disagree with things.
*  It's good for you too.
*  Just all I do is just do what I enjoy doing.
*  If I could do this for free, I would still do it.
*  I enjoy it.
*  So you do this podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  You have no aspirations of this being the hugest thing ever.
*  I don't even have any aspirations for growth.
*  I don't say, you know, by this time next year I'd like to have...
*  Nope.
*  You just focus on...
*  What I'm doing.
*  Yeah.
*  Output.
*  I feel like everything else is a distraction.
*  Like, as long as you're making enough money.
*  Brian Count said something to me once, and I never forgot it.
*  He said, and we were kids.
*  We were in our 20s.
*  He said, the only amount of money you need is so that you can go to a restaurant and
*  not care what things cost.
*  Everything else is bullshit.
*  If you got enough money, we can go to a restaurant, you don't worry.
*  Just order a bottle of wine, order meat, order whatever you want to eat.
*  You don't have to think about the price.
*  He goes, that's real freedom.
*  Because everything else, like all that other shit, you forget...
*  That's all just...
*  It becomes complicated.
*  You don't need that.
*  What you just...
*  Real freedom is the freedom to not worry about your bills.
*  That's the real...
*  I experienced that leap, that jump, when I got a development deal.
*  So I was like...
*  I guess I was 25?
*  26 maybe?
*  25?
*  And I got this development deal from Disney.
*  And it was like $150,000.
*  And I couldn't believe it.
*  I had $150,000.
*  This is nuts.
*  And I felt like a physical weight lift over my shoulders.
*  Because back then I was a road comic.
*  You do a gig on Thursday, it's $200.
*  You do a gig here, it's $150.
*  You're scraping together enough money so that you can pay your bills and eat.
*  You were always worried about gigs.
*  Always trying to fill my book.
*  Always trying to call booking agents, drive to Connecticut, drive to Jersey.
*  Where do I got to go to make some money?
*  And it was all just trying to stay alive and trying to make it.
*  Trying to become...
*  I didn't really think I was a legit professional comedian.
*  I could all go away.
*  And so I got that development deal and it was the nuttiest feeling in the world.
*  It was like I felt lighter.
*  Like I felt lighter.
*  And then I was like, oh, that's the key.
*  Get the monkey off your back.
*  Get the bill monkey off your back.
*  And that's the real freedom.
*  The real freedom is not being rich.
*  You don't feel any different being really rich other than the stuff that you can do.
*  But the way you feel in the day is the same way you feel if your bills are paid.
*  That's what you want.
*  All that other shit is like...
*  The other thing I noticed when I moved to California, it was the first time I had a
*  nice apartment.
*  And I'll never forget this either.
*  I was sitting in my apartment and it was a beautiful place in North Hollywood.
*  I had a loft at a pool table in my apartment.
*  I was like, this is amazing.
*  How is this real?
*  How is this mine?
*  After a while, it just became my house.
*  And then I realized like, oh, this is the same feeling I have when I'm home that I had
*  in my shitty apartment in New York.
*  It's the same feeling.
*  It's like, oh, this is home.
*  It's the same feeling.
*  It's not better.
*  It's not worth the amount of money that it costs if you're like renting a house that's
*  way over your budget and you're doing Uber just to try to pay your bills.
*  It's not worth that.
*  What's worth it is if it's comfortable.
*  If you have a TV and you have a nice bed and you can cook your meals, you're good.
*  That's what you need.
*  That's all you need.
*  Everything else is just like the amount of effort that you have to put in to make the
*  amount of money to get all these other things leaves you in this constant state of anxiety.
*  I think people just get lost in this idea of constantly making more and getting more
*  and chasing more.
*  I just concentrate on what I do.
*  That's all I concentrate on.
*  I concentrate on work.
*  I concentrate on comedy.
*  I concentrate on UFC fights.
*  I concentrate on podcasts.
*  I don't think about those other things.
*  I don't think about the direction of my career at all.
*  That's a great way to look at things because the only thing you really have control of
*  is what you do.
*  What you put out.
*  You being a pioneer in the podcast world, you and Mark Maron, I feel like we're kind
*  of...
*  Adam Curry was the first.
*  Adam Curry was the original.
*  The MTV VJ, he's still got a podcast now.
*  He's excellent.
*  He's a good friend of mine.
*  He's the number one guy.
*  He's the pod father.
*  Okay, he's the pod father.
*  He named it.
*  They started it off together.
*  Yeah, they started doing it years before I ever did it.
*  Mark had his a little bit before mine.
*  Adam Corolla was the first because Adam did it off of radio.
*  Adam had that radio gig where he took over Howard Stern's slots when Howard Stern went
*  over to Sirius.
*  Remember that?
*  He had this morning show.
*  That morning show was doing real well until...
*  Do you remember they used to have a talk radio station in LA?
*  Before podcasts, it was like Tom Lycus was on there.
*  There was a bunch of good shows.
*  That also made me think about doing podcasts too.
*  I didn't know that a podcast was ever going to be a thing, but I was like, this is a talk
*  radio station now.
*  Talk radio got so big, mostly because of Howard, I think.
*  There was a whole station where you could listen to the station.
*  It was all talk radio all day long.
*  There was a science guy on there late night.
*  I forgot what the hell his name was.
*  Yeah, you're right.
*  There was a station that had all these cool talk formats.
*  What I'm saying is, for me, I'm not so versed on the history of podcasting, but for me,
*  I just remember you as being one of the first guys to do this.
*  Yeah, we were one of the first.
*  Okay.
*  Now, you're here.
*  When you look at the landscape of podcasting from when you started to where it is now,
*  do you go, wow, this is amazing that all these people are doing it?
*  Could anybody do this?
*  It feels like everybody has a podcast.
*  I feel like there's a specific skill set to podcasting.
*  Do you look at what you did early on and what you're doing now and go, wow, look at the
*  growth?
*  That's definitely a lot better.
*  Yeah, I'm definitely better at talking to people.
*  Yeah, it's a skill.
*  You learn it.
*  It makes you a better conversationalist in the real world, for sure.
*  It makes you more considerate.
*  It's like comedy, right?
*  Yeah.
*  It's like you weren't the podcaster you were.
*  How long have you been doing this?
*  Right.
*  Podcasting, like 15 years?
*  15 years.
*  Somewhere around there?
*  Closing in on 15 years?
*  Yeah, so it took 15 years to get it to ... I mean, obviously, you've been successful for
*  longer than ... But it took a long-ass time.
*  Took a long-ass time.
*  I think nowadays, it's just ... There's amount of time you got to put into something in order
*  for it to be a gem.
*  Yes.
*  But even just the entertainment landscape, as I look at it, has entertainment changed
*  where now we're looking at the phone and we're looking at somebody do something crazy at
*  their house?
*  There's a guy I've been watching this insane ... His name is ... He's catching eggs in
*  his mouth, right?
*  Do you see this guy?
*  Insane ... Insane ... I forget the name of him.
*  Insane Shane.
*  This guy ... He catches eggs from how far away?
*  50 yards.
*  They're throwing eggs in this guy's mouth.
*  He's got the best mouth on the internet, right?
*  Does he break the eggs or does he catch them and not have them break?
*  No, they're like hard ... Hard boiled.
*  Or a meatball.
*  Oh.
*  This guy's chucking meatballs.
*  And he's catching them in his mouth?
*  50 yards.
*  That's a skill.
*  So I'm watching it and I can't ... Yeah, this is ... This again.
*  The marshmallow combine.
*  He's not catching all of them.
*  No, he's catching them and then spitting them out.
*  Oh my God, that's insane.
*  One of these guys threw at 50 ... Who throws a marshmallow at 50 yards?
*  I think they're like ex-football players or the guys that are throwing ... This guy's
*  doing routes.
*  Catching marshmallows in his mouth.
*  This is crazy.
*  People are trying to block him.
*  That's crazy.
*  He's catching the marshmallows.
*  That's amazing.
*  Okay, so ... That's a skill.
*  So I'm watching this now.
*  All right?
*  This is entertainment now.
*  Okay.
*  He's got a million followers.
*  Insane Shane one.
*  S-H-A-Y.
*  He's diving off speed boats, catching them in his mouth.
*  I mean, look at this guy.
*  Who would have ever thought that that would be a thing?
*  Oh, he dives into a ... Oh, this is a real ...
*  Oh, well, this is a real football.
*  So has entertainment in your eyes changed where ... It's changing where this is now
*  what people are watching instead of maybe a movie or a TV show?
*  It's definitely consuming a lot of your time.
*  I mean, if you look at your screen time, like if I look at my screen time on my phone, on
*  an average day it would be more than four hours.
*  How much of that is doom scrolling?
*  A lot.
*  A lot.
*  So that's entertainment.
*  So would I have been watching television during that time?
*  No, probably not because you could take your entertainment with you now, which is even
*  more distracting.
*  Yeah, but you're not watching ... You said you did an hour of Instagram.
*  You're not watching a movie or a documentary.
*  Sometimes I am.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I spend a lot of time doing that too.
*  But I do that in certain places.
*  I'll watch a documentary on an airplane or I'll watch something at home.
*  But I generally don't take my phone and I'm walking around the house watching documentaries.
*  Right?
*  Right, you'd sit down.
*  You would sit down and enjoy that.
*  But this is something that I would probably ... If I was on my phone from the kitchen to
*  the bedroom, I'm watching a guy catch marshmallows.
*  My question to you is, if the internet or social media wasn't around, do you think that
*  guy would be around?
*  No, he wouldn't be doing that.
*  But do you think this was existing 30 years ago where somebody was chucking marshmallows
*  and catching them just for fun and we didn't see it?
*  There's probably a guy in the neighborhood that could do it and everybody would come
*  over and watch Bob catch marshmallows with his face.
*  Yeah, I'm sure.
*  But it just never would have been the discipline that it is now where this guy's got fucking
*  ... The guy's blocking them and he's juking left and right and catching marshmallows in
*  the air with his mouth.
*  I mean, it's pretty impressive stuff.
*  So, do you think the social media and internet spawns this type of stuff?
*  100%.
*  100%.
*  Yeah, 100%.
*  It is a new form.
*  That's another thing you could say about podcasting too because before podcasting, no one thought
*  that the time when you're driving or the time when you're at the gym is time that you could
*  be entertained by something other than music.
*  Right?
*  Most of the time, unless you're listening to talk radio, of course.
*  But now, the podcast thing is like you could pause it at any time, you could start at any
*  time.
*  So, if it's an interesting podcast and you got a two-hour road trip, now you're occupied.
*  Now, the road trip's easy because now you're driving but now you're listening to some funny
*  fucking shit and Joey Diaz is telling stories and it's great.
*  I mean, so this area of entertainment wasn't available.
*  It wasn't being utilized before.
*  And so, what podcasts are really good for is it allows you to be entertained and occupied
*  while you're doing other shit.
*  I don't think most people who consume podcasts just sit there and listen or sit there and
*  watch.
*  I think a lot of times, like maybe you're cooking and while you're cooking, you got
*  your earbuds in, you're listening to a podcast or while you're driving or while you're on
*  the fucking treadmill and you're bored, you get to listen to some interesting shit.
*  And I get a lot of messages from my friends that will tell me, oh, I was at the gym and
*  I was listening to Shane, it was hilarious.
*  You guys are killing me.
*  Like that kind of stuff is or, hey, there's this guy with that power plant, Egyptian pyramid
*  guy, you believe that?
*  What do you think about that?
*  I was in the gym.
*  It was kind of freaking me out.
*  So it gives you this opportunity for entertainment that didn't exist before that's not completely
*  useless, right?
*  Like scrolling for stuff and the guy catching marshmallows in his mouth, I'm not getting
*  anything out of that.
*  It's fun.
*  It's interesting.
*  It's kind of useless.
*  But podcasts are not.
*  And you know, you do get to sit in on interesting conversations.
*  You get to consider ideas that maybe you never considered before.
*  So it wasn't available before.
*  And because of phones and because everybody has it's so easy to get a podcast, everybody
*  has access to them.
*  Do you listen to podcasts?
*  Yeah, all the time.
*  Are you going to them for comedy or more informational podcasts?
*  What's your what's your forte?
*  I listen to a lot of different podcasts.
*  I listen to podcasts that are comedy podcasts.
*  I listen to history podcasts.
*  I listen to podcasts about science.
*  I listen to podcasts about, you know, pretty much everything.
*  Hunting podcasts, you know, which are very valuable.
*  Hunting is a it seems easy.
*  Like the idea seems easy to people.
*  It's not.
*  It's really hard.
*  And there's a lot of things that people learn along the way on in their journey of hunting.
*  And they'll explain it to you.
*  And so if you encounter that, I'll say, oh, Remy Warren said when you do this, be careful
*  of that.
*  Now that's in my head.
*  You know, so it's just like it's a way that you can accumulate information.
*  Yeah.
*  And I I I listen to this Huberman.
*  Yeah, he's great.
*  And half of the stuff goes over my head.
*  You know, he's hard.
*  He's hard.
*  You got to make even when I do podcasts with him, I have to make notes.
*  I make notes that I ask him afterwards.
*  And, you know, but he's very fact based.
*  And he's a great guy, too.
*  I have I have to ask you this talking about here, but I knew you interviewed him.
*  Do you ever have somebody come on the show where you're nervous to have them like, oh, man, this is.
*  Oh, yeah, definitely.
*  Like, who are you nervous to interview?
*  Roger Penrose, the Nobel Prize winner.
*  He's a just just a brilliant mind and older, you know.
*  So I'm like, how is this conversation going to go?
*  How do I engage him?
*  I don't want him to feel like he's wasting his time here.
*  So I want to I want to be prepared of good questions.
*  And I don't know how much experience those guys have on podcasts or how much of an experience they have at all with comedians.
*  You know, I don't want to fuck around too much.
*  I just want to just get the most out of him that I can get.
*  Like, I just want to try to, like, massage his wheels and ask the right questions and be curious about all the right things and be informed enough to to know what the right questions are.
*  Yeah. And what I'm actually and also very fascinated by his research.
*  So I really it's like having an opportunity to talk to a brilliant person, you know, because he's done a lot of research in the Big Bang.
*  He's got a very interesting thought about the Big Bang that he doesn't think the Big Bang was the beginning of the universe.
*  And that's something that a lot of physicists are considering now.
*  It's very it's very fascinating stuff.
*  The idea that the universe is eternal or much older than we think it is.
*  Yeah, that's crazy. I mean, you gotta be a chameleon.
*  You got so many people, different different people coming in here.
*  Yeah. Comedy to, you know, doctors to to what have you.
*  And you got like a just you do have to adjust to every different personality.
*  It's just an art form. But it makes you more flexible as a person to have conversations with all kinds of people.
*  Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. It's better.
*  I like it. It's a lot better than the way I used to think before I started the podcast.
*  You know, 2009, I was very close minded.
*  I just was doing it just for fun. I mean, I was open minded generally, but not like I am now.
*  I wasn't aware of why I thought what I thought and what my biases are and why why I think of things in certain ways
*  instead of like considering them from like a broader perspective.
*  But when you do a podcast, you're kind of forced to do that because there's a lot of times when even if I agree with someone about something,
*  I have to take the position of someone who's skeptical and ask them a question like, but what about this?
*  So instead of just confirming them and us existing in an echo chamber, I'll try to offer consideration like, OK, but why?
*  Someone could think of it this way. Do you think of it this way ever?
*  Have you ever tried to think of it this way and just like see, you know, how their brain works?
*  Everybody's brain is, you know, they're different. You know, you have children.
*  And one of these you find out when you have children is right out of the box. They're different people.
*  They are different people. It's fascinating.
*  Yeah, because you you know, you meet a kid and he's four.
*  You're like, look at that smart kid. What an interesting kid.
*  But you don't you didn't get to see that kid with his brother and his sister and all of them coming out of the same woman and going, this is all from the same father.
*  Like, this is nuts. They're totally different things.
*  They have different personalities, different likes, different different strengths.
*  You know, it's really interesting. Yeah, it's crazy to see.
*  I mean, my daughter and my son, the differences between them and you don't really notice it or don't really pay attention to it until you have kids of your own.
*  And you actually see it going, wow, this one's outgoing.
*  This one's shy. Yes, this one likes piano. This one likes T ball.
*  So it's like and you might even me and my sister, your brothers and sisters.
*  I mean, my sister and I, although very similar, also very different.
*  And it's it's it's really crazy as a parent to.
*  And also you want to, you know, you want to give them structure.
*  You want to give them kind of the best things you grew up with from your parents and then put those, you know, yes, give them to your kids as well.
*  But you also want to see them flourish in their own personality.
*  So, you know, the parenting thing is, you know, I take it extremely serious.
*  Like I want to give I want to be there for my kids.
*  I want to, you know, I want to I don't want to work so much where, you know, you know, like even even coming to Austin, Texas for podcasts or going to Dallas for a show.
*  It's like, yeah, you have to think about. Yeah.
*  It never used to think I would be like, book it. Just get it. Just book it.
*  And now it's more like, hey, you know, are we coming to this run?
*  Are you guys going to come to New York? Right. Right.
*  That helps a lot. That helps me a lot. If I could take my family with me, you know, I take them with me a lot of times on Vegas, you have sea trips, too.
*  It's nice. Yeah, it's nice, especially now that the kids are getting older.
*  Yeah. Travel. Also, Vegas is a fun place to do stuff.
*  You know, there's other stuff we could do before the fights and stuff like I don't know if you ever done escape rooms.
*  You ever do escape rooms? No.
*  Escape rooms are fun. I'm claustrophobic.
*  And this just happened to me recently. Don't get that tank then.
*  Don't get that sensory deprivation tag. I don't know if I could do that.
*  It happened to me on an airplane. Oh, no. Sitting at the window seat.
*  It just overcame me. I said, I got to get out of here. Oh, no.
*  Ever since then, like I get I have to have an aisle seat if I go to a theater and watch a show. I have I can't be confined.
*  You just came out of nowhere. Out of nowhere on an airplane. Wow.
*  And I had to go in the back for two hours and hang out with the flight attendants and like stay on the rest of the time.
*  Wow. So did you tell them what was going on? Yeah, I said, listen, I'm freaking out.
*  I'm crawling out of my skin. I'm sitting next to two people. I feel like I'm trapped. I can't get out.
*  So I'm very anxious now. If I get on an airplane and here's one. OK, get out of an airplane.
*  I hate to do this, but there's a family and the father's like, do you mind changing seats?
*  So my daughter could sit next to me. I said, where's the where's the seat?
*  And it's like it's the window seat. And I go, I can't I can't go over there because I'm claustrophobic.
*  And of course, he was looking at me like I was making it up because I would have. Right.
*  You know, I mean, somebody told me that this fucking asshole let me sit with my daughter. Right.
*  But it's so bad where I just I can't sit at the window. Well, he could always ask somebody else.
*  You know, he could just ask someone else. Yeah. But but you were by yourself.
*  I feel like I feel like I let him down. Yeah, I'm sure you did. Yeah. I'm never that guy.
*  I'm always very cooperative. What do you need? I always move seats. Yeah.
*  I'm always worried about other people freaking out. Like there was a video that just went viral recently of some guy saying he was going to take the plane down.
*  This guy stood up in the middle. You see that guy, Jamie?
*  Is a few lately. That's what I always worry about. I worry about I worry about someone freaking out.
*  I worry about another person that you're going to have to deal with.
*  I feel though, if somebody's for you, you stab people, then you stab someone.
*  He had like a little knife on him and he stabbed a couple of people.
*  Yeah, he was saying that he was going to take everybody out. Oh, God.
*  I feel if you're on an airplane and that's happening, you would be one of these guys that would would handle it.
*  Right. Yeah. The problem with handling it is you're probably going to get sued and you might even get arrested.
*  It depends on how much damage you do. You know, you could permanently damage someone.
*  You could. People are very flippant about beating people up, but you could easily permanently damage someone.
*  Believe me, I believe you can. I'm just saying you have that.
*  I think that instinct, you know, like what's the problem where I have more of an instinct of is there a Joe Rogan on the plane?
*  I was on a plane once that a lady asked me if I would help her because these two guys were fighting.
*  One guy got in first and he put his briefcase above this other guy's seat.
*  And then he sat down and the guy who was right behind him goes, no, no, no, that's my spot.
*  That's my seat. That's spot over. He goes, no, it's not. It's first come first serve. Put it somewhere else.
*  It was open. I put it in there. And he goes, no, that belongs to my seat.
*  And then they started getting like belligerent with each other.
*  It started getting like to the point like, oh, my God, are these kids going to fight in first class?
*  And so then this fucking lady who is the flight attendant, she came in and told them both she was going to have them removed from the plane, sit down, shut up.
*  And then she came to me and she goes, if anything goes down, you're going to help me, right?
*  I was like, what do you want me to do? Because if I'm going to help you, it's going to get real messy.
*  Are you going to say that you said it was OK for me to do that to that guy?
*  Like, you know, I'm not going to like I'm not going to play nice.
*  If you're on a plane and you've got to take someone out, you have a very short amount of moves. It's got to be very violent.
*  You got to debilitate them. You got to like take them apart right there.
*  You can't like hope that you can hold on to them and then they relax.
*  Then what? You go back to your seat. Then I got to you got to put them out.
*  Yeah, you got to. You got to risk, you got to risk, you know, as you're talking to me, I feel like you're going through a bunch of different moves of what you could possibly do.
*  It's got to be violent. If you're going to if you got a guy like that with a knife, you're not grabbing that guy.
*  You're not just grabbing that guy and bringing him to the ground and holding him down.
*  You're going to beat his fucking brains in. You're going to stop his body from moving because otherwise it's dangerous.
*  Like you're in a position where you're being forced to use violence against some irrational, possibly schizophrenic.
*  Who knows what the fuck's going on with this guy? He could kill everybody.
*  Pastor stabs fellow traveler with weapon of pens and rubber bands on Seattle to Vegas flight.
*  OK, so what's going on? He fashioned a handmade weapon before launching an unprovoked attack against a man seated across the aisle.
*  Yeah, flying flying used to be his.
*  So he developed made a weapon out of his pens. He tied all his pens together and held on to them.
*  Wow. He said, I planned on attacking and killing him.
*  The defendant stated Jesus Christ. Defendant felt the mafia had been chasing him the last few months.
*  Yeah. So you go. So schizophrenic.
*  And, you know, they don't have fucking scans for that when they bring them in.
*  Oh, during the interview, the defendant admitted to the FBI agents that he was trying to stab CR in the eye to reach CR's brain to kill him.
*  OK, and said he was protecting his seven year old son.
*  The victim's wife was also hurt in the attack. She was shielding the couple's seven year old son. Jesus Christ, man.
*  So this guy just decided that this guy was in the mafia that was coming after him and he snaps and he wants to kill him.
*  What's going on on airplanes? Why is there all this violence now?
*  I think it's on airplanes. First of all, there's a lack of respect for authority that came with the whole defund the police thing.
*  So there's like people are more belligerent towards authority.
*  So you have that and then you have the the general heightened level of anxiety of the population post covid went up substantially.
*  Covid fucked a lot of people's lives up. We got lucky. We were very fortunate.
*  We make money. We were able to make money during the pandemic. We had enough money to be OK.
*  A lot of people. That's not the case. So so many people lost their businesses.
*  So many people lost their livelihoods. So many people have a deep distrust for the government and the world now.
*  And then there's this thing where people are being coddled for being mentally ill or you're you're you're almost like having a mental illness
*  is something you can talk about. It makes you interesting.
*  So I think people encourage mental illness, they encourage breakdowns and they do it all the time in the real world.
*  And so they think they could do it on fucking planes.
*  And then you got general genuinely mentally ill people who are just out of their fucking minds who really shouldn't be out there in the world.
*  And, you know, they think the mafia is after them and they're making a fucking handmade shank while they're sitting in 16a.
*  You know, the whole thing's nuts. And it's just like I think people are just much more on edge right now than they've ever been before.
*  And I think a lot of it is a function of mainstream media.
*  You're being fed every day. The worst shit that's happening in the world.
*  Gaza, Ukraine, you know, the fucking oceans boiling.
*  Oh, my God, what is happening? Putin's doing this and Xi Jinping is in control of that.
*  And the fucking borders open. Ah, fentanyl. Ah, you know, it's just like everyone's on edge.
*  So you get all those people, you stick them in a fucking tube and then you fly them through the air where there's no one that's really there's no authority figure on that plane.
*  There's these women, these poor women or men or whoever they are, this flight attendants that have to fucking deal with these people.
*  And most of them are just regular people. They're not.
*  I mean, they do have those guys that hide undercover that are on planes occasionally.
*  What do they call those guys? Yeah.
*  What do they call them? Air Marshals. They stopped doing that. Oh, great. Of course they did.
*  All the security, right? To get to the airport, all the security to get on the plane.
*  Once you're on the plane, no security. Yeah. They got security guy walking around Whole Foods making sure you don't steal an apple.
*  Right. You're 35,000 feet up and what? Flight attendants going to subdue a guy with pens?
*  Exactly. And who's going to get hurt along the way? What if he did stab that guy in the eye?
*  You know, like Jesus Christ, you know, even Mike Tyson got in a fucking fight on a plane.
*  Some guy kept fucking with him. He turned around and beat the shit out of the guy. And now Mike's getting sued.
*  I saw that. Yeah, you think I should go to they should ship that guy somewhere where it's terrible.
*  You got to live here now. What would you take on this Tyson thing?
*  I go back and forth. I don't generally like the idea of 58 year old men fighting.
*  It seems crazy risky at this point in your life. You're definitely going to be slower.
*  You're definitely going to be your reflex is going to be slower. You can't take shots as much.
*  But I don't think that a 50 year old man today or 58 year old man today is the same thing as what we thought of as a 58 year old man when we were kids because of hormone replacement.
*  So because of nutrition, hormone replacement, science of recovery, and they've got Mike Tyson doing everything.
*  He's doing all kinds of things. He's not a regular 57 year old guy. And then you see him hit the pads and he go, Jesus Christ, man.
*  I mean, this is a terrifying human being.
*  I mean, he's still fucking terrifying hitting the bag, hitting the pads that he still has the ability to deliver those punches.
*  And if any one of those hits anybody, they're fucked. You're fucked.
*  He's not it's not like his punches are, you know, 30 percent of what they used to be.
*  They're like 80 to 90 percent of what they used to be. Yeah.
*  Somewhere in that range. It's probably a little slower than he used to be. He used to be insanely fast.
*  There's a video of Tyson hitting the bag as a 19 year old and he's throwing these combinations like, but he's 210 pounds, 215 pounds throwing combinations like Sugar Ray Leonard.
*  Like it's it's insane to watch. He was so fast. And that was a big factor in his success.
*  He does not have that kind of speed anymore, but he's still fast. He's not slow.
*  But Joe, I mean, we're just we're watching a 58 year old man crazy right now.
*  Now, if you were 30, 40 years ago, I was watching the We Are the World documentary and I'm looking at the people.
*  Kenny Rogers is in that and I'm going probably 60 years old here.
*  And I look at 47 and 47 years old in the We Are the World.
*  So the the aging process has I mean, there's no way 58 year.
*  Yeah, it's 47. That's crazy. Younger than I am.
*  That's crazy. He looks. He's he's 10 years younger than me in that video.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So. Yeah.
*  The 58 year old man now young Billy Joel.
*  Tina Turner.
*  Willie Nelson looked young. Damn. How old Willie Nelson there?
*  I know 100. No. How old is he?
*  He's 90 now. I know how old he is.
*  He's in his 90s. 52 years old in that video. Is he really?
*  Yeah. It's amazing. So you're right.
*  58 years old is it's very different. Different.
*  What was Foreman when he came back? 45 when he won the title.
*  He was 33. I think he was 33 or 36 when he was coming back and everybody was mocking him.
*  And then he beat Michael Moore when he was 45 years old.
*  He's the oldest man to ever win the heavyweight title.
*  And that was before hormone replacement. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
*  I think I think Tyson is a 45 year old Foreman. No. Yeah, he's it's similar.
*  I mean, Foreman wasn't as fast even back then as Tyson is now.
*  Tyson's still faster, but he's smaller to George is a very big man.
*  George has enormous. He has hands that are like the size.
*  His fists like the size of a cigar box.
*  They're fucking giant fists, which is a big factor in punching power.
*  You know, this was George at 45 years old.
*  And Michael Moore, who was a sensational light heavyweight, was kind of undersized as a heavyweight.
*  As a light heavyweight, he was a fucking assassin.
*  But George caught him with a one two and put him out at 45 years in a fight.
*  He was losing. Michael Moore was out boxing him.
*  But here here, even at 45, you know, like a boom.
*  You know, like, you know, Tyson at 58. No, no, he was much slower.
*  But George was always kind of slow. He just has thunderous power.
*  He was never like a real fast guy like Ali or any of those other guys.
*  He was just thunderous, ridiculous power.
*  George was just terrifying.
*  And I don't know the ins and outs of boxing, but is this Logan Paul?
*  Is he a is he a legitimate boxer?
*  A legitimate boxer. Yes.
*  People mocked me when I was saying that before, but now I think people are coming around.
*  And the way I look at it, I say if this kid was not a YouTuber,
*  if he wasn't some guy that you knew from the time he was like 16 years old on YouTube
*  and you just saw him box and you saw him knock out former UFC champions,
*  you saw him beat legitimate boxers or beat athletes and beat a bunch of MMA fighters,
*  you'd go, this kid can fucking fight. He knows how to fight.
*  Like it's not it's not nothing he's doing looks wrong.
*  He's not like sticking his head straight up in the air and winging punches with his eyes closed.
*  He's fighting well. He looks good.
*  And if he was just an up and coming boxer that was this exciting,
*  like highly promotable, like really good at selling fights,
*  he'd be like, this kid's the future. He's really something special.
*  And the fact that he's willing to fight Tyson,
*  even if Tyson's 57, just the fact that he's willing to actually take a chance
*  at Mike Tyson not being able to do what he used to do, because that's what he's doing.
*  The gamble is like there's not a fucking chance in hell that Jake Paul would survive
*  against the Mike Tyson that beat Marvis Frazier.
*  You ever watch that fight? That's my favorite Mike Tyson fight,
*  because that was Mike Tyson before he won the title.
*  It was ABC World of Sports and Joe Frazier had been talking shit about Tyson,
*  that if he was in his prime, he'd beat Tyson.
*  And so he had his son fight Tyson and it was an execution.
*  It was an execution.
*  Is that the one in Atlantic City where it lasted one round?
*  One round. Let's watch it, because it's one of my favorite fights to watch Tyson,
*  because it's Tyson in his prime where he was fucking terrifying.
*  He was so fast and he would do angles and he was bobbing and weaving.
*  You couldn't hit him and he was just coming at you.
*  And he was young. He was 20 years old at the time.
*  He couldn't be stopped. No one had the solution.
*  And I submit that that Mike Tyson, the Mike Tyson that won the title against Trevor Burbeck,
*  the Mike Tyson that beat Larry Holmes, I think that Mike Tyson is the best heavyweight of all time.
*  I don't think anybody fucks with him.
*  He just didn't maintain that form and he wound up losing to Buster Douglas.
*  I look at fighters when they're in their absolute prime.
*  What have you ever seen that was better than this?
*  And with Mike Tyson, I've never seen anybody better.
*  I've never seen any fighter, even Ali in his prime, even Ali when he was Cassius Clay.
*  I never saw anybody who looked like Mike Tyson in his prime.
*  I think it just you can't maintain the kind of focus that was required to be this guy.
*  Look, I mean, Marvis looks fucking terrified and he should be because he kind of knows.
*  I mean, Marvis was a good fighter.
*  Marvis was a good fighter, but this is just a terrifying mismatch.
*  Like if I had if I was a Vegas oddsmaker, I would put this at a million to one.
*  I'm like he has to break his leg like he has to fall down and twist an ankle.
*  Otherwise, he's so Tyson was 20 and Frazier was 25.
*  So do you think this is this is the last we see of a guy like a Tyson?
*  Is there another Tyson out there or is it they can always emerge?
*  Combat sports always. So this is the beginning of the fight.
*  Look, he's just moving forward and Frazier is just trying to just bob and weave and find his openings.
*  But Mike never gives you any time.
*  He never gives you any time. He's always right in front of you.
*  And he's just measuring you.
*  And it's just a matter of time before he catches you.
*  And here it is. Look at this.
*  Oh, wow. Oh, wow.
*  Bro, he just puts him away. Just puts him away.
*  It's an execution.
*  It was just a matter of Mike Tyson closing the distance.
*  This Mike Tyson, as fast as he was, as hard as he hits, I maintain he's the greatest.
*  Yeah, the greatest heavyweight ever.
*  Like that Mike Tyson, those fights were you wanted to see executions.
*  You didn't think anybody was going to beat him.
*  Everybody he fought looked like they were about to die when they were in that ring.
*  I don't think we see this again, Joe.
*  You never know. It can happen.
*  Jake Paul's favorite. He's a favorite.
*  Yeah. Well, he's 27 years old and he's a really good boxer.
*  He's a very good boxer.
*  Like he's a legitimate professional boxer.
*  He fought Tommy Fury, who's also a legitimate professional boxer, a real good one.
*  He's Tyson Fury's younger brother, and he lost a close decision.
*  But it was a good fight, a real good fight against a good fighter.
*  He can fight. But if that Mike Tyson from Marvis Frazier fought Jake Paul, Jake Paul's dead.
*  He's dead. He's not going to make it.
*  So you have to say, how much has Mike Tyson lost from that 20 year old guy in the 37 years since then, which is crazy.
*  It'll be 38 by the time they fight. He'll have turned 58 by the time they actually fight.
*  Yeah, but that's the best it gets, right?
*  The best it gets.
*  The best it gets. After 37 years, you got to feel like it's, you know, yeah, he's lost some.
*  But he hasn't lost everything. He hasn't lost everything.
*  Yeah. See him hit those pads. Absolutely.
*  He has not lost everything.
*  But he's lost some. But coming from the best, he's now like maybe just normal, right?
*  He's still not normal, but he's still like a professional heavyweight boxer. He's still terrifying.
*  No, I'm not saying he's not, but I'm just saying even even coming off the best, I still think he he wins.
*  You coming off. It's hard to say because you never bet against a 27 year old fighting a 58 year old.
*  I just what I have in my brain and I can't get out is that you know, it's also his mind.
*  You know, like Mike Tyson's mind has switched over into war like he was doing this interview and someone said to him, he goes, he goes, you look like you're in your 20s.
*  Like, what are you doing? He goes, I just eat raw meat.
*  He's like raw meat. He goes, you're eating raw meat. He goes, yeah, I'm eating raw meat.
*  He goes, because that's what I'm going to eat when I fight. I'm going to eat him.
*  It's raw meat. Yeah.
*  Yeah, see, he's like, Jesus Christ, he's in this fucking mode.
*  He's in that God of War mode and that he's still got that in him.
*  And I'm telling you, if you keep giving that guy hormones and you keep giving that guy supplements and you keep and he's constantly training his.
*  Look at this. What are you eating? Raw meat. Seriously, Mike, you're eating raw meat. Are you swallowing it or remember you used to spit that stuff out?
*  I'm going to have to eat it now because my opponent is going to be raw meat. That's right.
*  Now, I saw the beginning of this interview where he had a shirt on, right?
*  He was sweating so much he had to take the he took his shirt off and they just put the microphone on his shoulder.
*  Yeah, bro, he's in savage mode right now. He's in savage mode.
*  I if I was Jake Paul right now, I would be shitting my pants.
*  If I saw if I'm fighting this guy and he sees eating raw meat, I call the fucking thing off.
*  It's all it's all the experiences that he has had as a conqueror.
*  You have to take those into consideration when a man has smashed men before just smashed men like when no one can stand in front of him.
*  That is in his mind still. That's in there.
*  There's a dark chamber in his mind that he can open up. Yeah.
*  And I think he's got it open. The question is, can his body move along with it?
*  But that part of his mind, you're clearly seeing he's terrifying when he's in the zone.
*  I changed the shape of the table because of him.
*  This table was we had the table that was this size at the old studio and the new studio.
*  I was like, maybe we'll make the table smaller. It'll be more intimate.
*  It'll be closer to the guest. So we had Mike Tyson in when he was 300 pounds and he was just eating and having fun and smoking.
*  He goes, I don't even work out. He goes, if I work out, I'll excite myself. It'll excite my ego.
*  And then I don't like that person.
*  So he just decided that he was just going to be chill Mike Tyson.
*  And then he got this offer to fight Roy Jones Jr.
*  So he gets in insane shape.
*  And the next time I see him, the second podcast we do, Mike now weighs 230 pounds and he's got these muscles in his forearms.
*  So he's sitting there and he's a different human.
*  He's so intense that I was like, if this table was closer to him, I would be nervous.
*  Like I wouldn't be able to do my best job as a podcaster.
*  I literally this the reason why this table is this width is the second podcast I do with Mike Tyson, even Jamie.
*  When Jamie, when Mike left, Jamie's like, that's a different person.
*  It's a totally different person. Right.
*  I was nervous the whole time.
*  I'm so glad I was close to the door.
*  He was so intense. He was so intense.
*  And that was a fight with Roy Jones Jr.
*  Where he just decided to have one more legends fight.
*  And he got like, look at him. Dude, he's just.
*  What the hell? What do you mean?
*  You're getting excited.
*  Seriously, Mike.
*  You've got both things playing at the same time.
*  Hold on a second.
*  You had animosity towards.
*  So when you finally get your hands on them.
*  Hey, what does it mean when fighting gets you get you rekt?
*  What does that mean?
*  It's a good question.
*  She means you're getting excited.
*  Yeah.
*  So that that's going through your mind right now.
*  Well, that's how I get when I was a kid.
*  And I, you know, sometimes I get the twinkle.
*  The twinkle. Yeah.
*  Well, that's what I'm saying is like you reached a state as a human being,
*  as a champion, as a ferocious fighter, you reached a state of ability
*  and of accomplishment that very few humans will.
*  I don't know if you can hear him breathing.
*  He's breathing.
*  It's like a lion running when you're hitting the bag, when that heart's beating again.
*  Because I'm firing them up right now.
*  You're Mike motherfucking Tyson.
*  So when you're doing all this shit again, you're still Mike Tyson.
*  Those thoughts have got to be burning inside you again.
*  It's got to be pretty wild.
*  I don't know.
*  It's wild, but I believe it's rightfully so to be that way.
*  And I just know how to I don't think I master it, but I just know how to deal with it.
*  I don't let it overwhelm me.
*  No, of course not.
*  It's a strange conversation to have because he was like so focused and so intense.
*  It was almost hard pulling conversation out of him.
*  At any time, did you feel afraid?
*  I'm always afraid when I'm around that guy.
*  Kevin Hart said it best.
*  He goes, it's like being in a room with a lion.
*  Even if the lion is like...
*  Jamie Foxx's little joke is someone let a pit bull out loose in the room
*  and they don't know who it is.
*  Jamie's got to play him in a movie, which has got to be terrifying.
*  Don't piss that guy off.
*  I never talked like that.
*  Oh, sorry.
*  Sorry, sir.
*  I'm curious.
*  I'm going to watch the fight.
*  We're all going to watch the fight.
*  I'm going to watch it.
*  I mean, it's a brilliant move by Jake because like if he was going to fight anybody else,
*  people would watch.
*  But with the same amount of people watched, no.
*  No, this is the one.
*  And this is the one where the old heads are all sitting around like going,
*  oh, well, wait until he gets a hold of Mike Tyson.
*  Boy, he's going to regret that.
*  And all the old guys are like pulling for him.
*  Like, come on, Mike.
*  Come on.
*  One more.
*  You got one more in you.
*  Well, I think we see a different Mike Tyson than we did when he fought Roy Jones.
*  I think the Roy Jones fight, they made an agreement not to punch in the head.
*  I'm pretty sure because I watched that fight carefully many times.
*  And it never looked like he was targeting Roy's head, which makes sense why Roy agreed to do the fight.
*  You know, I think they probably made an agreement.
*  It would be like a real boxing match.
*  But just don't knock me out.
*  Roy is a smaller person, much smaller.
*  Roy was at his very best when he was 168 pounds.
*  And then when he was weighing 175 pounds, he didn't even have to cut weight.
*  He was playing.
*  Roy famously played a basketball game, a full basketball game the day of his fight.
*  Played a basketball game and then went and boxed the face off of somebody for 12 rounds.
*  You know, that's how good Roy was in his prime.
*  But Roy was 168 pounds in his prime.
*  He wasn't Mike Tyson size.
*  Mike Tyson is fucking enormous.
*  He's just a different mass.
*  He's the width, the density.
*  It's terrifying.
*  And if they're older guys, I could imagine them making an agreement.
*  Because if you watch the highlights, Mike never punches him in the face.
*  And even if they do punch each other in the face, it seems like it's just like jabs and small punches.
*  It does, you know, like almost like sparring shots.
*  It's not like anybody's like really like winding up, you know, but really like really like throwing everything at it.
*  This fight doesn't have that stipulation.
*  No, I do not believe that's the case.
*  I think this fight is going to be a real full bore, 100 percent fight.
*  It's not even an exhibition.
*  It counts on their professional record.
*  So it's a professional fight.
*  OK, yeah.
*  Is it eight rounds?
*  Eight, two minute rounds.
*  Yeah, they made it two minute rounds because Tyson's old and they they were going to do 16 ounce gloves.
*  16 ounce gloves are down to 14, I believe.
*  Is that the case?
*  I think they're 14 ounce gloves, which is not not much bigger than a regular glove.
*  You know, regular gloves, 10 ounces in the heavyweight division, six ounces in lighter divisions.
*  I think they use eight in some divisions, too.
*  But most like big guys use 10 ounce gloves.
*  Yeah, it's it's again, talk about the change of entertainment.
*  Even in the boxing world, we interviewed Dana White on our podcast and he's got I'm sure you're aware of the slapping thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  Now, is that just if I slapped you right now, right.
*  Is that different than taking a punch?
*  Not at all.
*  No, it's terrible for you.
*  Yeah, you do. They're basically agreeing to brain damage.
*  They're agreeing to let each other get slapped in the head because you have to get slapped.
*  You have to stand there and get slapped.
*  And the only thing that could save you is if your slap is so good and you win the coin toss or whatever the fuck they do decide who slaps who first.
*  You slap that guy unconscious and it's over.
*  And it happens.
*  Guys get slapped.
*  I mean, it's you're literally taking a full on blow to the face.
*  Your hand can hit pretty hard if you just think think of that.
*  Yeah.
*  Try doing that with your knuckles.
*  It's hard to do.
*  It hurts.
*  Yeah.
*  It doesn't hurt at all when you do that.
*  You can slam so you could really fucking slap someone.
*  You know, guys have knocked guys out slapping them many times.
*  It's not hard to knock.
*  You could KO someone.
*  Boss Rootin was one of the all time greats in MMA.
*  And he started his fighting in an organization called Pancrase and Pancrase in Japan.
*  This is the early days.
*  But like as the UFC was just emerging, they started doing fights with no gloves on.
*  But they said instead of punching, you could only slap.
*  So what boss Rootin, he's got very flexible wrists.
*  So you pull his hands way back like this.
*  And he was basically just punching you with the palm of his hands.
*  So he wasn't throwing them like you would think like a bitch slap.
*  He was throwing punches with his palms.
*  He was uppercutting guys and knocking them unconscious with his palms.
*  So that is what you're agreeing to when you're standing in front of a guy and you're letting a guy whoop you in the head.
*  You're agreeing to getting you could easily get KO'd, easily get your jaw broken, easily get your eye socket shattered.
*  Are these ex boss?
*  This is boss.
*  So look how you see how he dropped that guy with that palm strike.
*  But the way he throws it, it's like a punch.
*  Boss was a fucking animal.
*  He was an animal, like terrifying human being.
*  Great guy.
*  But man, in his prime, he was just destroying people.
*  He was one of the first high level strikers that made his way into mixed martial arts.
*  And he eventually became the UFC heavyweight champion.
*  Was he?
*  What was he?
*  He's a kickboxer.
*  Kickboxer from Holland, the motherland.
*  Of kickboxing?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Some of the all time greats came out Holland.
*  Yeah.
*  For one for whatever strange reason.
*  It was like it was a background of Kyokushin and a lot of them got into kickboxing and Muay Thai.
*  And there was a guy named Ramon Deckers.
*  He's like to this day, one of the most legendary Muay Thai fighters of all times.
*  This dude came out of Holland and went over to Thailand and just fucked everybody up.
*  You ever heard of Ramon Deckers?
*  Show Ramon Deckers highlight reel.
*  He was like a mini kickboxing Mike Tyson.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a monster because a lot of the guys that went over to Thailand, they were bigger than the ties.
*  But Ramon Deckers was the same size as the ties.
*  But he was just fucking ferocious.
*  Look at this motherfucker.
*  Bro, he he kicked guys so hard that he shattered his ankle so many times that he had to get it fused.
*  And his doctor was like, you have to stop fighting or you know, you're going to lose your foot.
*  And he was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
*  Just fucking bolt this thing down so I could get back at it again.
*  I mean, his highlight reel is just fucking terrifying.
*  It's just him mauling people.
*  But these these kicks, right?
*  I mean, doesn't it hurt the kicker as much as it does?
*  No, not as much, but it definitely hurts.
*  I mean, especially if you hit the instep on like an elbow or something like that.
*  Yeah.
*  But shins shins are pretty good at tolerating pain.
*  My joke. Come on.
*  I mean, I hit my shin on my bed frame.
*  I'm down. Yeah.
*  That's just what you get conditioned.
*  You know, you get conditioned to the point where you can you can bang your shin against things.
*  It doesn't even hurt.
*  Don't these guys train on trees?
*  Yeah, they train on banana trees.
*  In Thailand, they'll do the kick banana trees.
*  But banana trees are pretty soft.
*  You can kick a banana tree and they give out.
*  They give a little bit when you hit them.
*  It's not like a regular tree.
*  I've never seen a banana tree.
*  I've been around a banana tree in Thailand.
*  I kicked one just to see what it was like because I seen a lot of videos of these guys kicking them.
*  Yeah, they're it's not the worst thing to kick.
*  It gives a little bit.
*  So there it is. See, because it gives.
*  See how it gives when he's kicking it.
*  It's flexible.
*  Like you could actually train on a banana tree.
*  It's not a bad thing to train on.
*  It's good right in half.
*  Yeah, see, it moves.
*  It's really not that much different than a heavy bag.
*  It just looks crazy because like, my God, he's kicking a tree.
*  But there's heavy bag like we have a heavy bag out there in the gym.
*  That's my friend, Kevin Ross gave it to me and it's filled with sand.
*  And that's just to condition your shins.
*  That one's horrible.
*  That one you kick.
*  It's like, oh, what are they normally?
*  Usually it's cushioning like there's foam.
*  And then it depends on what the stuffing is.
*  Sometimes they stuff it with rags and cloth and stuff like that.
*  And the whole idea is it's really packed down tight and it's heavy.
*  So it's like 130, 150 pounds.
*  And it's long and you could do leg kicks on it.
*  But the sand one is as hard as a rock.
*  It's just thud, thud.
*  And you do that just to condition your shins.
*  That's the one you practice on just to condition yourself.
*  Yeah, I wish I could do some of this stuff with the I've always wanted to get into a fighting just for self-defense.
*  But I have detached my biceps.
*  So I have holes in my arm.
*  I have no bicep.
*  Well, I have a bicep, but just not that the short one is gone.
*  How did it detach?
*  Poke up and no bicep.
*  What? Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Nothing happened?
*  There's no trauma that I could pinpoint that this happened.
*  Now I have kids.
*  I was putting them in the car.
*  Maybe it felt something.
*  No, I didn't feel nothing.
*  Really?
*  Looking in the mirror one day and I go, I brought my wife over.
*  I go, is there a hole in my arm?
*  It's not.
*  Now I show you.
*  Let me see.
*  Oh, wow.
*  I've seen guys have that before.
*  My friend Matt Serra has that.
*  He has like his bicep.
*  When he makes a bicep, like half of it is missing.
*  Okay.
*  It's like it curled up on one side.
*  Matt Serra is a fighter?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm a comedian.
*  And I got a hole in my arm.
*  That is odd.
*  But you have most of your bicep.
*  Yeah, but that's an underside too.
*  Same side.
*  That one.
*  Did you go to a doctor?
*  Yeah.
*  He says nothing you could do about it.
*  But he says it's detached?
*  It's gone.
*  And you don't know why?
*  No, I don't know why.
*  Weird.
*  So then I'm thinking, do I got some weird Mediterranean type disease where like-
*  Shit starts detaching?
*  People from- my dad's got it.
*  Really?
*  But he put a luggage in the overhead compartment.
*  That's what his snap- his bigger bicep is living in his elbow now.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  And-
*  You can get that fixed if you do it right away.
*  Right away.
*  I didn't catch it right away.
*  So-
*  Well, it seems like with you there was no trauma.
*  No.
*  Which doesn't even make any sense.
*  No sense.
*  Everybody I know that's done that, like it's usually boxing or jujitsu or lifting weights
*  or something like that, it's painful as fuck instantly.
*  There's a video of a guy doing curls and as he's doing curls his bicep snaps and curls
*  up and you see like, ahhh.
*  It's horrible.
*  Yeah, it's horrible.
*  It's horrible.
*  And I've heard the same thing.
*  It's painful, but I have no pain, no nothing.
*  Well, it doesn't seem like it affects your range of motion either.
*  No, there's no-
*  So you can do everything.
*  There's no problem, but now I'm thinking, can't I even work out the bicep?
*  Because I'm afraid that one's going to snap.
*  No, you should.
*  Because if you don't, the bicep is not going to be strong enough to do the extra work that's
*  required missing that other one.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  You're fine.
*  You're fine.
*  Yeah, you could do everything.
*  You just got to get strong.
*  Just strengthen all the surrounding tissue.
*  You're fine.
*  What's the ads of a guy who doesn't really do any strenuous, no tennis, no nothing like
*  that.
*  Nothing.
*  To lose both of his biceps, right?
*  By 50.
*  And now I got it in my head that-
*  Everything's going to fall apart.
*  Everything's going to snap.
*  Yeah, but you haven't lost your biceps.
*  Your biceps are there.
*  It's like whatever that other thing is that attaches, that's not there anymore.
*  But I don't think you need that.
*  I think you're fine.
*  I wouldn't worry about it.
*  Legitimately, I wouldn't worry about it.
*  I would just start working out.
*  I would just get really into strengthening everything around it.
*  That's what I-
*  Especially since you can't fix it.
*  Can't fix it.
*  But Matt does everything.
*  I mean, Matt has a black belt in jujitsu and his biceps are way worse than yours.
*  His is pulled all the way up to the top.
*  So at the bottom, when you make a muscle like this part, he doesn't have this part.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just flat.
*  Yeah, it's my dad.
*  And it's a little bit up here.
*  I've seen a bunch of people who have that.
*  Okay.
*  That's a common thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm just shocked that it happened so early in life.
*  It doesn't make sense that it didn't hurt at all.
*  That seems weird.
*  Strange.
*  But you seem like you have full range of motion.
*  Yeah, no.
*  I'm golfing.
*  I'm active.
*  But I used to love biceps.
*  I'm Italian.
*  They're still there.
*  I used to- but listen.
*  Alone in a mirror with the shirt off.
*  You don't like it?
*  No.
*  It looks weird.
*  Oh, you used to love to stare at yourself?
*  Yeah, doing biceps.
*  That was my favorite exercise.
*  That's funny.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I literally never do that.
*  I never do biceps.
*  Ever.
*  Well, growing up, that's what we always used to do.
*  Right.
*  20s, 30s, 40s.
*  We're doing it.
*  Yeah.
*  Bice.
*  Right.
*  Curls for the girls.
*  Curls for the girls, man.
*  Right.
*  And now I got holes in my arm.
*  I don't think it'll affect you.
*  I bet you can still do bicep curls no problem at all.
*  I bet your biceps will grow.
*  I don't think it's a problem.
*  I don't think it's a problem.
*  Okay.
*  I don't know what happened.
*  I don't understand it.
*  It seems weird.
*  And maybe it felt like it happened when you were way younger.
*  You just didn't notice it.
*  Maybe as you got older, your body changed.
*  No.
*  Nothing?
*  No, it's just a dramatic aesthetic.
*  Aesthetically, you would've-
*  So you just noticed it one day?
*  One day, doing my hair.
*  Dropped my arms, looked in the mirror.
*  I thought it was a shadow from the thing.
*  It must've been a shadow.
*  But no, it's a-
*  There's a hole.
*  It's a hole.
*  And I didn't catch it in time, and now I'm walking around with no biceps.
*  That's so strange.
*  But you do have biceps.
*  Well, yeah.
*  Missing one of those things.
*  One of the biceps.
*  I don't think it's a big deal.
*  You didn't need it, obviously.
*  You weren't using it.
*  Fell apart.
*  Gave up.
*  It's like an appendicitis.
*  Yeah.
*  You get rid of it and still walk around.
*  This guy isn't even fucking interested in this muscle.
*  It just quit on you.
*  Do you have a trainer?
*  Yeah.
*  So how often do you work out?
*  I do about three or four days with the trainer, and then I do two days Pilates.
*  Oh, nice.
*  Which has helped my sciatica.
*  So I started three months ago.
*  I have had sciatica two and a half years, affecting everything, including my comedy.
*  Because I'm physical, I like to move.
*  But the pain was relentless.
*  And I'm like, I didn't want to get the surgery.
*  Was it a disectomy that they were trying to get you to do?
*  It was spinal.
*  I don't know what exactly, because I don't listen.
*  And I don't know anything as far as the research.
*  The guy told me what it was.
*  I'm like, OK, one ear out the other.
*  But stenosis of the spine, that's what was happening and whatnot.
*  And some L3, L4, L4.
*  You know what you need to get that will help you a lot?
*  A lot.
*  There's a thing called the Dex.
*  It's one of those teeter products where you hook your legs to this thing and you lean
*  your body forward.
*  You know those ones where you hang by your ankles?
*  Those are good.
*  Those are really good.
*  They're great for a lot of reasons.
*  But this one is my favorite for low back decompression.
*  This thing right here.
*  We have one out there.
*  I'll show it to you.
*  It's called the Dex, D-E-X-2.
*  It's an inversion and core training system.
*  But the thing that it does the best is when your legs are supported, you can do back extensions
*  and stuff on it.
*  But I really don't use it for that.
*  Mostly what I use it for is just decompressing.
*  So I get on it and all your weight is now on your thighs and all the weight of your
*  upper body from your hips down is just decompressing.
*  And you feel it pop like I'll lie in it and it goes pop, pop, pop, pop.
*  Like I'll feel it decompress.
*  It's amazing.
*  I love it.
*  And it also you can do back extensions when you're on that same incline and it's really
*  good for strengthening those muscles.
*  And also sometimes that helps me loosen them up even more.
*  I'll do a set of back extensions on it and I'll really like deeply relax and let it pop.
*  All right.
*  Yeah.
*  Decompression of the back and spine is very important.
*  That's why yoga is so good because you're stretching and decompressing things.
*  And if you're tight and then everything tight as you get older, like you just keep shrinking.
*  You know, that's what happens to old people.
*  They're fucking the space in between their spine goes away and then they get this hunch
*  and then they're immobile.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't want to be immobile.
*  No, no.
*  And I felt like this LaGree Pilates have definitely changed my life.
*  Pilates is amazing.
*  They're very, very good for that.
*  Yoga, very, very, very good for that.
*  Anything where you're using your whole body like that, you know.
*  And it's for a lot of people, there's a lot of contributing factors that lead to sciatica.
*  There's tightness of the hamstrings.
*  There's tightness of the upper quads that also affects your lower back and compresses
*  everything.
*  When I have back pain, one of the things that I do is I sit on my heels and I lean all the
*  way back.
*  So if my legs bent and it really stretches out my upper legs, my thighs, my quads.
*  And when I do that, I feel it in my lower back.
*  Like I feel my lower back relaxing.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I feel stretching out.
*  And then I'll do a bunch of other different exercises like that.
*  But that's what keeps me from having back pain.
*  Yeah.
*  The importance of stretching, I found is huge.
*  It's huge.
*  And everybody's lazy.
*  Nobody wants to stretch.
*  Even me.
*  Even when I get done with a workout, I'm like, I could stretch.
*  I should stretch.
*  I want to go eat.
*  And sometimes I'll just go eat.
*  But most of the time I stretch.
*  And when I do, I always feel way better.
*  Like before a big show, I always stretch.
*  Always.
*  In the back?
*  Yeah.
*  I just lay down on the floor and start stretching.
*  And when I do that, it's like everything just feels better.
*  Because the physical tension that you carry in your body, if you can mitigate some of that,
*  you just feel looser.
*  You get out there.
*  You feel loose.
*  It's just age really crept up on me.
*  Oh, it's a motherfucker.
*  Really crept up on me.
*  It's a motherfucker.
*  So I'm doing all I can to kind of combat that.
*  How old are you now?
*  50.
*  When you see guys that are 50 that don't take care of themselves, though, you see the difference?
*  That's scary.
*  Yeah.
*  That's scary when a guy's never taken care of himself and then he's 50.
*  And you're in a state of total...
*  I could pull your arm apart.
*  I could just grab your arm and pull it away from your shoulder socket.
*  There's nothing keeping that thing in there.
*  Like you're just...
*  You're made out of jello.
*  Your body doesn't have any need to be strong because it never gets used.
*  So your body just deteriorates into this like sunken lump.
*  And now you're in pain all the time.
*  And now you've got problems all the time.
*  Now you don't have the fucking energy to do things that you want to do.
*  For me, the whole thing is mitigating mental illness, like mitigating anxiety and stress
*  and anger.
*  Get that out, clean your mind out, and then make sure you have energy.
*  The only way you can get things done is if you have fucking energy, especially like writing.
*  Like people don't consider writing a physical health thing.
*  But if you're tired, you're not going to write as good.
*  You're not going to have the enthusiasm.
*  You're not going to have the energy.
*  It's like for everything, you need energy.
*  And there's only one way to get that.
*  You have to have a healthy body.
*  You have to.
*  It's like a part of the job.
*  It should be a part of the job.
*  I tried to tell it to fat comedians.
*  I'm like, I know you're great.
*  Look, we lost Patrice when he was in his 40s.
*  If Patrice was alive today, he'd have the number one podcast in the world.
*  Patrice was alive today.
*  He'd be selling out arenas.
*  We lost him because he just didn't take care of himself.
*  That's it.
*  That's the only reason why.
*  No, it's super important, not only for the comedy, but even looking at my kids now.
*  I'm an older father, so I want to do those things with my kids, whether it be skiing.
*  Right, have fun.
*  They went skiing, where we went skiing in December.
*  And my wife loves skiing.
*  And of course, I'm at the fucking bottom of the hill waiting for the...
*  I'm pitch...
*  You know what I've become?
*  Or was becoming?
*  Say hi to daddy!
*  We go to Disneyland.
*  They're on the rides.
*  You don't do the rides?
*  Oh, fuck no.
*  I never do the rides.
*  I throw up in my lap when I do these rides.
*  Really?
*  All of them?
*  Yeah.
*  No Space Mountain?
*  Space Mountain is amazing.
*  So fun.
*  I got a weak stomach, Joe.
*  I could barely take the takeoff on a flight, let alone drop in...
*  Glostrophobia?
*  Yeah, I'm a mess, bro.
*  Glostrophobia, no biceps, and fear of a roller coaster.
*  Things can be a lot worse.
*  No, I'm fine.
*  I'm fine.
*  I complain for the sake of comedy, but I'm blessed.
*  Yeah.
*  You're back out here in August.
*  I'm doing the Moody Center.
*  Nice.
*  That's a great venue.
*  I've never been there.
*  I heard it's brand new.
*  Yeah, it's amazing.
*  It's an amazing venue.
*  This is a great town for comedy right now.
*  There's a lot of big time comedy fans here now.
*  Yeah, well, your club, which I'm dying to do, and I'm sorry that I didn't get out here
*  to do it, but I definitely want to do the ship.
*  I hear great things about it.
*  Yeah, next time you're in town, come by and hang out with us for a couple of days.
*  We do shows Tuesday, Wednesdays, and Thursdays are my shows, and this show's seven nights
*  a week.
*  Great, yeah.
*  I want to make it more of a meal next time I come out.
*  This is kind of an in and out thing.
*  I want to utilize the...
*  I want to see if I can get in the tank.
*  Yeah?
*  Yeah.
*  You can do it.
*  Maybe...
*  You want to take an edible first?
*  You want to really do it?
*  See?
*  No.
*  No.
*  You know what?
*  Baby steps.
*  I want to do an edible, but I want to...
*  I know some people come in here and go, hey, you got an edible?
*  Don't do that.
*  I can't do anything unless I do a test run at home.
*  Right.
*  Right, right.
*  So, whatever you got here, what is this?
*  Rogi?
*  What is this?
*  Oh, these are just nicotine.
*  Oh, that's nicotine.
*  This is nicotine.
*  What's the good...
*  I'm looking to get into maybe an edible every now and then.
*  Well, California is a perfect place to do it because you can get those nice 10-milligram
*  edibles.
*  10-milligram.
*  You eat the whole thing.
*  Easy.
*  Try five.
*  Just try five.
*  Eat half of it.
*  And what is this?
*  Is this the type of thing where you're like, oh, hey, this is great?
*  Or is this the work...
*  Maybe.
*  Or deep paranoia.
*  Depends on how much you take.
*  I don't need to be paranoid anymore.
*  Dark, dark, dark, dark.
*  I don't do dark.
*  I think I told you...
*  We might think about these solar flares ahead of our way.
*  Do you hear about these solar flares?
*  These solar flares that are supposed to reach us on the 10th and the 11th to some mass coronal
*  ejections that could play havoc with our communication systems, our satellites, could shut down the
*  power grid if one's big enough.
*  You haven't heard about this?
*  Come on, look at me.
*  I barely heard about this.
*  A friend of mine who's actually a legitimate scientist actually warned me about this.
*  He said, it's really strange that we're not being told about the potential impact of this.
*  Earth prepares for solar storm impact from three CMEs this weekend.
*  Solar activity has reached high levels in the past 24 to 36 hours with background flux
*  at or near M1-0.
*  I don't know what that means.
*  The most significant developments from the sun include the growth and merging of regions
*  3664 and 3668, as well as the production of numerous M-class solar flares and two X-class
*  solar flares from what CME is, coronal mass ejection, that are expected to arrive at Earth
*  this weekend.
*  Joe, no.
*  Keep this up there.
*  If this was me and you sent me this article, read this about solar flares.
*  You know, would it turn me off?
*  Just visually.
*  Okay.
*  3664, I see that in a paragraph.
*  I ain't reading it.
*  Just the numbers alone.
*  The regions?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm the opposite.
*  Whatever you read just now didn't even register in my head.
*  Couldn't even comprehend it.
*  Did you get any of that?
*  For me, what I got is a deep respect for these people that have not, they're not just watching
*  the sun, but they've made regions of the sun so they can refer to these specific regions
*  where this solar activity is taking.
*  Tomorrow.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I was saying.
*  The 10th and the 11th.
*  That's what my friend was telling me.
*  X2.23b flare.
*  He was actually concerned that his wife was going to be out of town while this was happening.
*  He's like, you should have food and you should be prepared.
*  Yeah.
*  Despite this, go back up.
*  The region continued to produce optical flares, radio bursts, and an isolated M-clan.
*  That's one of the craziest things about the sun.
*  The sun is not static.
*  It's like, it's all over the place.
*  It's got these giant ejections that happened that could cook our satellites.
*  In the past, before we had the kind of infrastructure that we have today, there was a big mass ejection,
*  I think, that they recorded in the 1800s that took out communications for whatever they
*  had back then.
*  I like the sun, Joe.
*  You like a tan?
*  Beautiful tan.
*  Are you a beach guy?
*  Do you like going to the beach on vacations?
*  Love the beach.
*  A little margarita.
*  Sit there.
*  A little margarita, a little Mexico beach vibe.
*  My kids build a little sandcastle.
*  Mexico makes me nervous.
*  Did you hear about those surfers that just got killed in Mexico?
*  Why do you got to ruin that joke?
*  They found them in a well.
*  Shot in the head in a well.
*  They stole their car and shot them in the head and threw them down a well.
*  I'm at the beach with a margarita and you're in a well with three gun wounds that I had.
*  Why do you got to ruin the visual for me, Joe?
*  Come on.
*  I don't know what happened to these guys but shit can go western.
*  Shit can go sideways.
*  When you're in Mexico.
*  Mexico surf for death.
*  Man charged.
*  Confessed to girlfriend.
*  Oh wow.
*  Killed these two dudes over a car.
*  Their bodies are found dumped in a cliffside well six days after they disappeared.
*  Each with a gunshot to the head.
*  That's terrible.
*  There's shit that could...
*  Yeah, there was a fourth body that had been there longer.
*  It was unconnected to the case.
*  There goes the family trip to Mexico.
*  Most of the time people go to Mexico, there's no worries at all.
*  I went down there once and I was worried and I saw Halle Berry there.
*  I'm like, oh, she's here.
*  No, I'm not worried.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel if you see Halle Berry anywhere, it's like it's okay.
*  She's going to be fine.
*  Yeah.
*  Joe, I don't know.
*  Mexico worries me though.
*  It's just like it's controlled by the cartels.
*  The country is essentially controlled by the illegal drug market.
*  So you would not go to Mexico?
*  I've gone to Mexico.
*  I love Mexico.
*  But it is what it is.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  It's a different kind of sketchy.
*  They're generally protective of tourists.
*  Generally, yes.
*  They don't want to fuck up their tourists.
*  They don't want to fuck.
*  Then the government will come down on them if someone kills tourists.
*  It could happen on Wilshire Boulevard.
*  It will happen on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles.
*  That's why I don't live in Los Angeles.
*  I know.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it could happen anywhere, really.
*  Anywhere now.
*  But Los Angeles has a higher likelihood of shit going sideways.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I agree.
*  What's it like?
*  What's it like?
*  Are you enjoying it?
*  There's been many conversations over dinner.
*  What are we doing here?
*  I'm sure you went through that prior to me.
*  Well, I know you looked out here for a little bit.
*  I looked out here for a little bit.
*  Now's a good time to look.
*  Now there's a lot of great houses that are available.
*  Okay.
*  A lot of money came here.
*  A lot of people came here.
*  A lot of building got done here.
*  There's a lot of, like, I have a great real estate agent if you're still interested.
*  The growth is exponential.
*  Yeah.
*  The quality of life is fantastic.
*  It's much better.
*  Okay.
*  But I got off the airplane.
*  The heat?
*  And I was sweating right out of the gate.
*  Can't take that?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't like heat.
*  You don't like heat?
*  I don't like humidity.
*  So that is a big, big factor of moving anywhere, whether it be Florida, Texas.
*  Los Angeles gets pretty fucking hot, dude.
*  It does get hot.
*  I'm not saying it doesn't.
*  I'm just saying this is like a different kind of heat for me.
*  It's a wet heat.
*  It's uncomfortable.
*  Yeah, it's better for your skin, though.
*  Maybe.
*  And we've often tossed around Los Angeles to place for us.
*  With me, I got a family there.
*  I got my mother there.
*  My sister's there.
*  What about San Diego?
*  Nah.
*  No?
*  No, not a big San Diego.
*  Really?
*  No.
*  I love it down there.
*  I love Florida.
*  Florida's great, too.
*  Thought about there.
*  I have a family in Naples, Florida.
*  Hot as fuck.
*  Hot as fuck, though.
*  Yeah.
*  Hotter than here.
*  Yeah, I feel like if you go to one of these places that have a hot summer.
*  People are dumber, too.
*  They're dumber in Florida?
*  Yeah, they're dumber.
*  Generally.
*  They'll fit right in.
*  There's some brilliant people in Florida, don't get me wrong.
*  But if you had to do a statewide IQ test, it might be disturbing.
*  Yeah?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  A lot of people escaped to go to Florida.
*  Florida's a place where people ran from their past.
*  I just feel like if I go to Florida, I'm running from paying an exorbitant amount of money
*  in taxes.
*  That's true, too.
*  And quality of life might be better.
*  It would be better.
*  And that's Texas, too.
*  Texas doesn't have state taxes, either.
*  California has 14%, which is insane.
*  It's insane.
*  It's so high.
*  This morning I took a beautiful walk along your, what is this, a river you guys run
*  through the city?
*  Lady Bird Lake.
*  Lady Bird Lake, right?
*  Right about the bats.
*  Yeah.
*  And had a night.
*  And just people, hello.
*  It's nice.
*  It's a nice vibe out there.
*  I'm not going to lie.
*  But?
*  But I'm rooted over there.
*  I was rooted, too.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  Yeah, but it's not worth it.
*  It's not worth it to be rooted in a place that sucks.
*  I understand.
*  The conflict, the feeling, like, why am I still here?
*  I don't have any of that here.
*  I had that feeling for a while in LA, even before the pandemic.
*  I'm like, do I really need to be here?
*  But I just didn't know another way to do it.
*  It was like there was no other way to do everything that I want to do.
*  Podcast, comedy.
*  I'm in LA.
*  This is like, I guess this is where I live.
*  From the time you started to think about moving to the time you moved, what was that, years
*  wise?
*  I've been thinking about it for a long time.
*  I lived in Colorado for a little bit in 2009.
*  But I had been thinking about it for a while, but it didn't seem possible.
*  But then when the pandemic hit, it was like, OK, the whole world is different now.
*  Now you got to move.
*  You got to get the fuck out of here because LA was going sideways.
*  And I'm of the opinion that once things start going bad, it takes a long time, especially
*  in a Democrat controlled state.
*  It takes a long time for things to turn around.
*  And I think that's the way it's going to be if they turn around at all.
*  And everybody has this idea of, oh, this is LA.
*  LA is like that.
*  I'm like, no, it's not like that anymore.
*  They're burning cop cars in the middle of the street, looting businesses.
*  They're letting people do it.
*  They're smashing grabs.
*  They're just telling you you can't shop after 6 p.m.
*  This is madness.
*  We got to get the fuck out of here.
*  That was my take.
*  My take was like, this is not the same LA anymore.
*  You don't stay in your house while it's on fire just because like, but it's my house.
*  No, it's on fire.
*  So that was my take.
*  And the family was on board?
*  Yeah, they loved it.
*  Well, the kids were young enough.
*  My youngest were 10 and 12 when we came here.
*  And we got them to my real estate agent.
*  She's brilliant.
*  She took us to the lake and the girls were on a boat.
*  We're all hanging out.
*  We were jumping in the water together and swimming and people listening to the fucking
*  Leonard Skinner and people were singing and drinking.
*  And it was like everybody's having fun and there was no masks.
*  Whereas in LA, everyone was like terrified and locked down.
*  And so this was in May of 2020.
*  We were only it was only two months into the pandemic and I was already trying to get out.
*  And then by August, I was already here.
*  It's like, fuck you guys.
*  And then by October, Dave and I started doing shows.
*  We started doing shows at Stubbs.
*  And then November, we started doing indoor shows here like, Jesus Christ.
*  It was and then it was crazy.
*  And then the influx, everybody started moving here.
*  Sikora moved here.
*  Tony Hinchcliffe moved here.
*  Brian Simpson moved here.
*  Derek Poston, Asana Mahd, they moved here.
*  William Montgomery moved here.
*  Ron White was already here.
*  Duncan Trussell moved here.
*  Tim Dillon moved here.
*  It just started getting crazy.
*  Joe DeRosa just got a spot here.
*  Joey's coming next week.
*  It's just it's been amazing.
*  But it had all those things had to like take place in the exact right order.
*  It's almost like you had to hit every green light on the road.
*  It's just all the things had to happen the right way to be able to happen.
*  Yeah.
*  To make what actually took place.
*  It's kind of crazy.
*  It is nuts that this place.
*  I mean, I just looked around the city.
*  I mean, the amount of buildings that are going up is crazy.
*  The only thing I do see, do you think the infrastructure of the city can
*  withstand the amount of people here, like the roads and the traffic?
*  They're doing work on that.
*  They're expanding things.
*  It's going to be growing pains for sure.
*  There's obviously a lot more traffic now than there was 10 years ago.
*  But it had always been growing.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I remember, you know, my business, Onnit was out here.
*  And so we were coming out here for Onnit.
*  And every time I would come out, like over the years, I'd notice like traffic was
*  picking up more and more before the pandemic.
*  You know, so but then during the pandemic, obviously, there was a massive
*  influx of people like we're getting the fuck out of California.
*  And that was the biggest factor.
*  I'm not arguing with you, Joe.
*  It's a great move.
*  I know it just takes you have to decide because no no place is going to be like,
*  oh, my God, this is perfect.
*  Every place is going to come with a thing.
*  But this thing is like also like way cheaper.
*  It's way cheaper to live here.
*  Yeah.
*  You get more for your money if you're trying to buy a house and your state
*  taxes are nonexistent, which is just way better.
*  Because look, if California was perfect, it would be a great place to live.
*  It's a great place to live.
*  It's a great place to live.
*  Because look, if California was perfect and I had to pay a lot of money,
*  but they kept the streets clean and, you know, there was no crime and everybody's
*  having a good time and there's great schools and great social programs like
*  this feels good.
*  I mean, yeah, I'm spending a lot of money in taxes, but man, I live in a fucking
*  utopia.
*  I love it.
*  This doesn't feel like that at all.
*  It feels like you're getting fucked by people who tell you they're going to fuck
*  you and they have to fuck you.
*  And if you don't want to get fucked, you're a part of the problem.
*  Yeah.
*  I got to get out of here.
*  I don't feel like that here though.
*  All said.
*  I don't feel like that here.
*  I don't feel like that when I'm in Nashville.
*  I don't feel like that when I'm in Florida.
*  I think there's parts of this country that haven't lost their fucking minds and
*  people gravitate towards those parts where people realize like, hey, there's
*  some real need for law and order.
*  There's some real need for rules.
*  There's some real need for, you know, you got to have your fucking ducks in a
*  row.
*  And then you have to have your psychos take over the school systems and teach
*  nonsense.
*  Like, there's a real, there's a real, there's a good mixture.
*  And I think Austin's the best mixture because it's a liberal city.
*  It's a very, very progressive city that's surrounded by ranchers.
*  It's surrounded by fucking people in the small towns that are all, you know,
*  driving pickup trucks and shooting signs.
*  It keeps everything balanced.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a nice balance here.
*  Because even the most liberal people here, they're so much more reasonable than
*  liberal people that I would meet in LA.
*  Liberal people in LA were cult members and they felt like if you weren't on their
*  team, you were some kind of a Nazi and, you know, you shouldn't be allowed to
*  vote.
*  You definitely should lose your job.
*  It's a tough place to live, Joe.
*  I'm not going to argue with you.
*  Yeah.
*  When you come back in August, I'll take you around.
*  Yeah.
*  And it'll be a good time to know if you hate it because it'll be hot as fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm going to burn my skin off.
*  August is going to be sweaty and hot, but it's beautiful.
*  And the food.
*  Ooh, there's so much good food here in Sebastian.
*  There's so much good food.
*  So much good food.
*  Now, I'll come back where we'll do a proper Austin run.
*  All right.
*  Do it for a few days.
*  You got anything to tell people about?
*  Got a major tour, July 11th, called the It Ain't Right Tour.
*  It Ain't Right.
*  A lot of stuff in Los Angeles.
*  It Ain't Right.
*  So that starts July 11th at Norfolk, Virginia.
*  And I'm currently shooting Bookie.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You're on a show, a Chuck Lorre show.
*  Chuck Lorre show on Max, which we're in our second season.
*  We're shooting that.
*  Who's in that with you?
*  Omar Dorsey's in it.
*  Andrea Anders, Vanessa Ferlito.
*  I've heard good things about it.
*  I've heard it's a great show.
*  Really fun show.
*  I want to watch it.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's on Max?
*  Yeah.
*  It's on Max.
*  I have like eight episodes on there right now.
*  Nice.
*  And then we're filming.
*  Boy, that guy, Chuck Lorre, that fucking guy's not at all.
*  Hits, bro.
*  Hits.
*  Nothing but hits.
*  My family's addicted to the Big Bang Theory right now.
*  So my youngest, my wife and I, watched The Big Bang Theory.
*  I've watched like 100 episodes over the last four months.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  I underestimated that show tremendously.
*  Because I had seen clips online, I'm like, this show sucks.
*  And then you watch it, and go, this is a funny show.
*  It's a really well-made show.
*  Really great writer.
*  And this is my first TV series.
*  So to have this guy.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  So I did a pilot years ago with Tony Danza playing my dad.
*  Never got off the ground.
*  How is it like meeting Tony Danza?
*  Oh, great.
*  I grew up with Tony Danza, taxi.
*  And he's the boss.
*  And he played my dad.
*  And he was really, really good.
*  But that was a network show, and they ever picked it up.
*  Are they making four-camera, like multi-camera sitcoms anymore?
*  On networks?
*  I don't know about networks.
*  But yeah.
*  Miss Pat.
*  Miss Pat's got one?
*  Yeah, she's got a multi-camera show.
*  But I mean, do any network tell, like what is on?
*  Like network TV on like Thursday night now?
*  Is it all like The Bachelor show?
*  Yeah I think we're seeing a lot of like reality, maybe dating shows.
*  Game shows, reality shows.
*  Big Brother or One of You.
*  But yeah, no.
*  It used to be all sitcoms.
*  It used to be all sitcoms.
*  Well, you were part of that world.
*  Well, that's why watching The Big Bang Theory make me say like, I enjoy sitcoms.
*  It's a great way to consume entertainment.
*  You don't see them anymore.
*  Look at this.
*  Come here.
*  Vanessa Lachey was my wife.
*  Come here.
*  So it was like talk to camera.
*  So I would do a little talk to camera, and then I would pop back into the scene.
*  So the talk to camera for me would kind of, was like, oh, I could show my comedy a little
*  bit here, and then I go back into the scene.
*  But yeah, man.
*  I wonder if sitcoms are going to come back.
*  I hope they do.
*  If networks are smart, they'll put together some multi-cam sitcoms.
*  Because it's still a fun art form.
*  It's still a fun way to consume humor.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  And it will come back.
*  It will come back.
*  Maybe.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know either.
*  We'll see.
*  We'll see.
*  Maybe.
*  And also I have a podcast, Pete and Sebastian Show, which we are now.
*  Say hi to Pete for me.
*  I haven't talked to Pete forever.
*  Pete's a good dude.
*  I can't believe that you said before I saw you here today that I haven't seen you in
*  four years.
*  Five.
*  Is it really five?
*  2019, I believe, was the last time I was on your show.
*  But I've seen you since then.
*  Seen you, seen you at the store in 2019, I think.
*  Before the pandemic, I think I saw you.
*  Yeah, that was 2019.
*  Yeah, five years ago.
*  Yeah, almost.
*  In March it'll be.
*  I definitely haven't seen you out here.
*  It's my first time to see you out here.
*  I want to tell you congratulations on all your success.
*  Thank you.
*  Even walking through this place before I came in to know, I saw you at the combi store hanging
*  out in the parking lot and now you're floating in a tank in your own warehouse.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  Well, congratulations to you too, because I remember when you first started.
*  I really do.
*  I remember your first struggles at the store.
*  I remember I saw you.
*  I was in Vegas.
*  I was working in Vegas and I was in my hotel room by myself, flipping through the channels
*  and I saw your special and I think it was a Showtime special.
*  And I remember tweeting it.
*  Like it was fucking great.
*  It was great.
*  You actually reached out to me and said, hey man, this is really good stuff.
*  It's funny.
*  Eleanor Kerrigan was on a podcast and somebody sent it to me and she's like, oh my God, Sebastian
*  was awful.
*  Awful when he first started.
*  Everybody at the combi store knew it.
*  They're like, how did this guy get past?
*  I'm sitting there listening to this going, fuck, I didn't even think I was bad.
*  It's funny what you think you are and what people are saying.
*  I didn't know any of that.
*  Well the problem was you started out as an open micer at the comedy store in Los Angeles,
*  which is crazy.
*  That's like learning how to play football with the Giants.
*  Like it's nuts.
*  Just the idea behind it is nuts.
*  It's a very, very difficult way to break into comedy.
*  And so everybody's terrible in the beginning.
*  If they've seen me six months in, they're like, oh my God, he fucking sucks.
*  Like how did he get past?
*  I know, but to hear it, to hear it was like, oh wow, I had no idea.
*  And not to even know you suck is awful.
*  Like I knew I was like learning, but I was like, I didn't know people were like, this
*  guy should be pumping gas.
*  You know what?
*  I don't know if you've ever had this on your podcast.
*  What are you guys, north of 2500 episodes here?
*  Something like that.
*  I drank way too much water.
*  Before the podcast?
*  During.
*  Oh, so you got to pee right now real bad.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  Yeah, I see your face.
*  We can wrap this up.
*  The tour, all that, where can the people find the information?
*  Sebastianlive.com, get your tickets to the tour.
*  It's going to be, I can't give anything away, but I'm into a lot.
*  I like production at my shows.
*  Not only the comedy, but the experience.
*  So we got some surprises on the tour.
*  Nice.
*  Coming to Austin, Texas.
*  When is that?
*  August 9th.
*  If I'm here, I'm there.
*  I would love to see it.
*  Great to see you again and congratulations to all your success too.
*  It's been beautiful to watch.
*  Thank you.
*  I'm very, very, very, very happy for you.
*  I appreciate you having me on your show.
*  My pleasure, brother.
*  Anytime.
*  Next time, let's not wait four years.
*  No.
*  Come back in August.
*  We'll do it again.
*  All right.
*  Appreciate you, brother.
*  Bye, everybody.
