# Joe Rogan Experience #2092 - Mariana van Zeller
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k)
*  Hello, good to see you my friend. How's things? Great. Thanks so much for having me again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm so happy every time I see you that you're alive and well. You do some wild stuff lady. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=16.8s)]
*  You get involved in some some situations. I do this this past year was crazy. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=22.8s)]
*  We just had season four come out and it's my favorite season for many reasons, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=29.8s)]
*  but also because it was quite the adventure. What did you get involved with this season? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=34.0s)]
*  Well, it ended with a military coup in Africa when my team and I got stuck. So that was part [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=38.64s)]
*  of Africa kick off to all of it. It was in Niger. So it's in the Sahel region of Africa. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=47.84s)]
*  The US has actually military presence. Remember a few years ago when there were these four US [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=53.16s)]
*  Marines that were killed in the Sahel in Niger and nobody even knew they were there. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=59.12s)]
*  Well, there's actually over a thousand troop stations in Niger and we were there in a little [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  town called Agadez, which is in sort of the southern border of the Sahara desert. And we [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=69.52s)]
*  were doing a story about gold mining. So the story itself was incredible. We had to you know, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=75.6s)]
*  we had a military convoy with us because it's incredibly dangerous part of the world. You've [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=79.68s)]
*  got terrorism, you've got ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, you've got kidnappers. So it's very, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=83.92s)]
*  very dangerous. We'd gone there with the permission of the government, but only if we had to have a [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=89.08s)]
*  military convoy with us at all times. So we're talking about four armored trucks with lots of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=94.68s)]
*  trained soldiers that every time we stopped, they'd get out of the trucks and basically point their [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=100.44s)]
*  guns all around. They were very well trained. A lot of them are actually trained by the American [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=104.8s)]
*  military. And we went out into the desert and visited these gold mines, which are crazy. It [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=108.36s)]
*  was an eight hour off-roading into the desert to arrive at these illegal unregulated mines. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=114.2s)]
*  We're going down these tunnels and it's, you know, a hundred meters down, hand dug tunnels with no, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=119.12s)]
*  nothing to buttress them, no safety precautions or anything. But we filmed it all and we get to the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=127.56s)]
*  end and there's people basically mining for gold. And again, constantly with the idea that the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=132.48s)]
*  military is telling us, okay, we have to film fast, we have to do this fast, we can't be out at [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=139.92s)]
*  night. So we went to a sort of safety, a more safe location to sleep that night under the stars. And [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=144.48s)]
*  then the next day it's time to come back to Agadez, the town, which is about a hundred miles, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=150.92s)]
*  but takes anywhere between like three to 12 hours to get, because you can, lots of things can happen [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  along the way. And we arrived in Agadez and we got worried that there had been a military coup and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=161.96s)]
*  the president had been deposed. And he was now being kidnapped inside the presidential palace. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  Basically he was stuck there with his family and that we were about to lose our military compounds [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=173.96s)]
*  and security. And they closed all the land borders and the airspace and we were stuck with no way [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=180.12s)]
*  out because you can't travel by road without security in that part of the world and there were [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=187.68s)]
*  no planes leaving. So we were stuck. Wow. How long are you stuck for? It was about nine days. The [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=192.96s)]
*  military coup happened on a Wednesday and we left on a Thursday, sorry, so eight days, but it was [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=200.52s)]
*  eight incredibly scary days. You know, I'm, I've been a journalist covering black markets and going [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=206.52s)]
*  to war zones and conflict areas all my life, but this was, I think, the most uncomfortable and scared [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  I've ever been because first of all, the uncertainty of not knowing there were all these, the West [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=216.96s)]
*  African states were threatening invasion. The Wagner group, the Russian mercenary group were saying [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=222.8s)]
*  that they were going to come and protect the new military coup leaders. And so it was a power [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  struggle between the United States and Russia. And that's sort of the last place you want to be, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=234.68s)]
*  right? And again, no protection. I'm there with my team. I'm sort of the boss in that situation [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=239.4s)]
*  because I'm the owner of the company that produces this. I'm the host of the show. I'm the executive [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=247.68s)]
*  producer. And I felt very responsible for my team as well. And, and yeah, the clock is ticking and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=252.4s)]
*  they're telling us that in a few days we're going to invade and there's going to be a massive [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=258.96s)]
*  possibility of a massive war. And we're stuck with, again, no protection and no way out. So it was [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=263.32s)]
*  really, really scary. How did it get resolved? That's the interesting part. So the funny thing [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=269.38s)]
*  is that there was an American military base, actually one of the biggest Air Force bases ever [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=276.34s)]
*  built costs over a hundred million dollars to build just two miles from our little hotel in Agadez. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=282.18s)]
*  We were the only foreigners there apart from aid workers that sort of live behind barbed wire and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=287.62s)]
*  in compounds. But we were the only foreigners staying in a hotel. This hotel, interestingly [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=293.3s)]
*  enough, was actually built when Qaddafi came to visit in the nineties or late eighties. And it [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=298.3s)]
*  was a rundown hotel. We were there, again, no protection, nothing. And the military base is [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=305.02000000000004s)]
*  just two miles from us. And we'd tried to get inside the base to film and we'd been denied access [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=310.54s)]
*  to the base. But when the coup happened, we managed to get a contact inside and started asking them, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=316.46000000000004s)]
*  we're here with no security. Can you guys come and help us and figure out, take us into the base, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=323.06s)]
*  something? We're all American citizens, except for our fixer, our local guy who was actually from [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=329.21999999999997s)]
*  Mali, but everybody else was American. And they were stuck in the situation that all the other [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=334.26s)]
*  countries had started calling this a coup, but the US government did not. And because the moment they [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=340.02s)]
*  called it a coup, they would have to remove the military, possibly remove military, remove their [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=345.78s)]
*  aid from the country. And that's the last thing you want to do. So they couldn't, they didn't want [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=351.06s)]
*  to evacuate us. They didn't want to call it a coup. They didn't want to get us out of there. Their [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=355.7s)]
*  hands were sort of tied. That's how they told us. And we started seeing slowly as the days started [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  passing and the situation was deteriorating. We started seeing, you know, the French were taking, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=365.22s)]
*  were sending planes to take out all the French nationals, the British, the Portuguese, which is [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=369.46s)]
*  where I'm a double nationality, where I'm from. And I'm on the phone with the ambassador for [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=374.18s)]
*  Portugal telling me there's a plane for you. There's like seats for you in the Capitol, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=379.54s)]
*  but the Capitol is eight hours away or 12 hours away by land and we can't go because there's, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=383.22s)]
*  it's too dangerous. No airplanes would take us there. And eventually we realized that the only [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=388.42s)]
*  way that we'd be able to get out is if we took matters into our own hands. So actually my team [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=394.34000000000003s)]
*  in LA found an evacuation company willing to fly a plane in the middle of the night to get us out. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=398.74s)]
*  That sounds like a Chuck Norris movie. Oh, it was an evacuation company. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=406.58000000000004s)]
*  It was actually Argo. It was, have you watched the movie Argo with Ben Affleck about the guys [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=411.38s)]
*  in Iran? Oh yeah, I did watch that. Yeah. And how they don't know until the last minute if they're [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=416.02000000000004s)]
*  going to leave or not. It was exactly that situation. So we get to the airport in the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=420.18s)]
*  middle of the night. So they told us that we had to be at the airport at this time, that we had to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=425.22s)]
*  take security with us because the pilot was refusing to land unless we had security there, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=429.78000000000003s)]
*  police. The police was supposed to show up. They never did. We arrive at the airport, it's sunrise [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=434.98s)]
*  and the military is there waiting for us. Yeah. It's one of those. And they start creating all [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=442.02000000000004s)]
*  sorts of problems saying we don't have the right paperwork. They're not going to let us leave. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=449.94s)]
*  Meanwhile, there was this amazing man, local man who worked at the airport that I'd met a few days [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=454.34000000000003s)]
*  before when I went there to try to see if there's any plane leaving, let us know. And so I stayed in [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=458.90000000000003s)]
*  touch with him and I had told him that it was my son's birthday, which was partially not true. It [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=464.18s)]
*  wasn't his birthday, but he was about to leave camp. And I've got this tradition as a working [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=470.34000000000003s)]
*  mother who travels all the time. We have this tradition that I always pick him up from camp and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=474.58s)]
*  it's performing arts camp. And so I told him, sorry, this is a very long story. No, no, it's good. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=478.34000000000003s)]
*  So I told him, you know, so he was there to help us, but the military was also there and they [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=484.5s)]
*  didn't want us to leave and creating all sorts of problems. And then we see the plane land and we [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=489.94s)]
*  see the pilot come out and we see the military start walking towards the pilot to tell them that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=494.26s)]
*  we didn't have the permission to leave. And my fear was that the pilot was immediately going to [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=499.62s)]
*  turn around because he had told us that we had 20 minutes. He was going to spend 20 minutes on the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=503.46s)]
*  ground. And if we couldn't get into the plane, he's going to leave without us. And they get there and [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=506.82s)]
*  he starts talking to them and I'm on the phone with the team in LA and I'm freaking out and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=512.82s)]
*  telling them, this is horrible. This is happening. They don't want us to leave. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=517.06s)]
*  And then my husband's on the phone with me as well. He's telling me, I see the pilot's name and I [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=521.2199999999999s)]
*  think he's Portuguese run to him. And I ran to him at the same time as a military. And I started [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=525.2199999999999s)]
*  speaking to him in Portuguese and telling him the situation and that do whatever you can to get us [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=530.42s)]
*  out. And the military can't understand Portuguese. So there was a secret communication happening [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=535.3s)]
*  between me and him. And, and he was Portuguese and he decided to take the risk of getting us on the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=539.6199999999999s)]
*  plane and we managed to get out of it. But the guy from the military was still yelling as the door [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=545.7s)]
*  closes. But so was the guy that I'd met at the airport who turns to me, yells my name and I look [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=552.26s)]
*  back and he says, Hey, Mariana, say happy birthday to your son. So in the midst of the craziness, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=557.7s)]
*  there was also a beautiful moment of connection and humanity. You've done so many of these [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=563.3000000000001s)]
*  boots on the ground, dangerous investigative journalist shows. Do you, do you at a certain [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=570.1s)]
*  point in time, do you like say, okay, I've rolled the dice enough? No. Wow. No, it's really, it's [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=576.66s)]
*  what I love to do. Obviously that was a moment of a lot of uncertainty, but still when we spent a [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=584.34s)]
*  week on the ground and we still kept on reporting on the story we were there for, we kept, we're [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=589.7s)]
*  stuck in this dilemma. Do we stay closed in our hotel or do we go out and continue reporting on [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=594.58s)]
*  the story we decided to keep reporting? But it is, it is, you know, there's a lot of sacrifice that [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=598.82s)]
*  goes into it, but I'm, it's what I love to do. It's so sketchy. Yeah. Sometimes it's sketchy, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=604.1800000000001s)]
*  not always, but sometimes. Well, the gold mine itself, just going down these hand, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=610.0200000000001s)]
*  no buttresses, hand carved gold mines, like, oh. Yeah. And these guys do it every single day [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=613.7800000000001s)]
*  for hours on end. And who are they digging gold for? They sell it to middlemen. We then went and [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=619.3000000000001s)]
*  interviewed the middleman, a guy called Clicley, super colorful character, who basically then [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=626.42s)]
*  sells it to the Gulf. Majority of the gold goes to Dubai. Really? Yeah. Dubai loves that bling. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=632.5s)]
*  They love the bling. They love the bling out there. Have you ever seen the amount of gold that exists [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=638.5s)]
*  on earth? No. The finite amount of gold that exists on earth is shockingly small, shockingly small. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=644.02s)]
*  Jamie, see if you can find that. The amount of gold that exists on earth. I forget what the exact [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=653.54s)]
*  unit of measurement that they used, but you go, what? What? That's it. 244,000 metric tons of gold [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=659.9399999999999s)]
*  has been discovered to date. Most of that gold has come from three countries, China, Australia, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=668.26s)]
*  and South Africa. So. Wow. Yeah, this is like. But if you, if you, like, I've seen it represented. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=672.98s)]
*  There, there it is. That's it. That's the whole. Yep. That's it. No way. Yep. That's it. It's all [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=680.34s)]
*  the gold. So what we're seeing, folks, is a couple of large trucks and what looks like a half a [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=688.1s)]
*  football field of gold. Is that about right? About a half a football field? Yeah. Yeah. But a half a [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=695.38s)]
*  football field full of gold. And it's stacked up about, looks like it's about five feet high. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=700.9s)]
*  Wow. Now maybe a little higher, maybe six feet higher. That's it. Yeah. It's all the gold. Yeah. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=706.26s)]
*  Which is why the price fluctuates. Sort of. But I don't get it. I don't even like it. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=710.74s)]
*  I don't like gold jewelry. It just, I like silver. Silver looks prettier to me. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=716.66s)]
*  Yeah. It's just like, I get it. I get it that people like it. It's rare. But it's weird that [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=720.9s)]
*  it's rare. Not that it's rare, but it's weird that we care. Like it doesn't even do anything. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=727.62s)]
*  It's not like you can make a weapon out of it. It's not like, like how did that stuff ever become [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=732.82s)]
*  the thing that is universally regarded as the most valuable in terms, and was backed our currency [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=738.0200000000001s)]
*  forever until the seventies? Yeah. What? Yeah. What is that? Yeah. Why are we obsessed with that [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=745.0600000000001s)]
*  stupid soft metal? It's pretty. Because there's not a lot of it. There's a lot of shit that's pretty. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=750.74s)]
*  Why, you know, how come rubies aren't worth as much? You know, maybe they are. I don't know. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=755.3000000000001s)]
*  But like, there's a lot of stuff that's pretty. Why is that stuff the thing that everybody wants [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=761.14s)]
*  to trade? Yeah. And diamonds as well is another one that I don't quite get. Yeah. Diamonds are [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=765.78s)]
*  really weird because diamonds they can make now. Yeah. But women don't want the made ones. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=770.66s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? It is. But you can barely tell apparently the difference. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=777.3s)]
*  How can you tell? Yeah. What kind of psycho? And why do you care? Yeah. Are you going over your [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=781.6999999999999s)]
*  diamond with a magnifying glass before you decide whether or not it's worthy of you wearing it? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=786.5s)]
*  What is what's happening here? Yeah. Agreed. It's a rarity thing. You know? Yeah. It's also, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=792.66s)]
*  it's like there's something sick about it. Like you want the ones that are created by the earth [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=798.66s)]
*  only that people had to risk their life to get. Not like some really fascinating piece of innovation [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=802.5s)]
*  that has allowed them. I mean, they can make large diamonds now. Yeah. And they look exactly like the [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=808.02s)]
*  real ones. Yeah, but they're not. Yeah, I know. But they're not. It's fake. It's not even fake. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=812.58s)]
*  It's a real diamond. But it's a diamond that's made by humans. But do you think women really [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=817.62s)]
*  don't, I haven't heard like people really say I don't want this because it's not. Oh yeah. I've [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=822.5s)]
*  had a conversation. With somebody who said that. Yeah. Mrs. Rogan. I'm not going to criticize your [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=826.9000000000001s)]
*  wife. She means she's not. She's just like, I'd rather have a real one. I'm like, that is a real [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=835.0600000000001s)]
*  one. Does this make any sense? I'm like, help me out. Just, it wasn't an argument or anything, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=840.42s)]
*  but I'm like, I don't get it. I don't, why is that? I don't either. You know, we had a, when I was, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=845.4599999999999s)]
*  one of the first stories I did with my husband back in the day, when we were still traveling [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=851.86s)]
*  and reporting together was actually in the Brazilian Amazon. And it was about this, one of [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=855.6999999999999s)]
*  the biggest diamond mines they've ever found. And it was on Indian land and white miners came in and [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=859.78s)]
*  the Indians decided to revolt and killed and tortured and cut off the penises of 30 of them. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=866.82s)]
*  And, you know, they killed 30 people, massacred and tortured lots of them. And it was horrible. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=873.38s)]
*  And we went there and started investigating this and we weren't married. He was my boyfriend at [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=878.9000000000001s)]
*  the time. We were planning on getting married, but we had, we were in these little tiny, you know, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=884.0200000000001s)]
*  wild west towns in the Amazon and the amount of people that we had come up to us and actually [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=888.82s)]
*  with little paper bags, like rolled paper with little diamonds on the side, asking us if we [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=892.58s)]
*  wanted to buy it for nothing, like close to nothing. We thought about it, but we didn't. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=897.7s)]
*  Yeah. That doesn't seem like you should. Maybe if you found one. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=903.3000000000001s)]
*  But just, well, we actually went to the mines and I remember that's what happens. We went to [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=909.3000000000001s)]
*  gold mines in the Amazon as well for another story is that when you're in these places, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=914.0200000000001s)]
*  you're, you can't stop looking at the ground. You find a chance. You find anything, but obviously. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=917.7s)]
*  Yeah. How difficult is it for them to find diamonds? Cause that's the thing about the [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=924.6600000000001s)]
*  De Beers. They're so smart with what they've done. They basically have warehouses filled with diamonds [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=928.98s)]
*  and they've elevated the price to pretend that they're rare, but they're not really rare anymore [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=934.98s)]
*  because of their mining abilities. The technology has increased. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=938.9000000000001s)]
*  They control the price that way. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=943.62s)]
*  Yeah. It's pretty smart. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=944.6600000000001s)]
*  Very smart. Yeah. It's difficult to find a diamond. It's really difficult. I mean, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=946.9000000000001s)]
*  there's a lot of backbreaking work. We went to Sierra Leone and did another story about that too. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=951.7800000000001s)]
*  It's backbreaking work. It's not easy and they make nothing. You know, the miners make nothing. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=955.94s)]
*  Yeah. That's where it's really creepy. Well, that's why they revolted. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=960.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=964.34s)]
*  Should have paid those guys better. Wouldn't have lost your penis. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=964.5s)]
*  Well, that's also the story of cell phones, right? I mean, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=970.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the rare earth. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=974.1800000000001s)]
*  That's the Garth Kara that was on and he discussed his work in the Congo where they were [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=974.5s)]
*  investigating these cobalt mines. And in everyone's cell phone is a piece of cobalt [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=982.1s)]
*  and there's a very high likelihood that was pulled out of one of these artesian mines by people who [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=986.26s)]
*  are working for basically slave wages. The women with babies on their backs while they're doing it, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=990.9s)]
*  they're hand digging this stuff. So you're inhaling these toxic fumes from this cobalt. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=997.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1004.18s)]
*  And it's so... I mean, I want to say that we're capable of better, but what we are as a species, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1004.42s)]
*  that is like one of the best indicators of how twisted we are. The very height of technology [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1016.42s)]
*  that is carried by all these social justice warriors and all these virtue signaling people [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1022.82s)]
*  online, you're literally doing it from a device that's made by slaves. At the root of it is [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1028.6599999999999s)]
*  slave labor. And it's unavoidable. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1034.98s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, yeah. But the same people that would probably never buy a diamond ring, right? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1038.26s)]
*  Yeah. I guess. I don't know. I mean, it's just weird. It's just weird that we know that that [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1043.1399999999999s)]
*  is where the stuff comes from. Well, it's also weird that we don't even manufacture a single [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1052.1s)]
*  cell phone in America with all parts sourced and put together in America. That's totally possible [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1057.54s)]
*  that you could buy a phone that is completely ethical, that's made by people that were paid a [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1064.42s)]
*  fair wage and they work normal hours and they have great healthcare and all that stuff. That's [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1070.8999999999999s)]
*  possible. And you would think that a device that is literally owned by every single human... There [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1077.86s)]
*  are more cell phones in this country than there are human beings. And yet, no, we don't make a [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1084.02s)]
*  single one over here because it's cheaper. I mean, even places like China where they make the cell [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1090.26s)]
*  phones, where they have the Foxconn factory that's covered with nets to keep people from jumping off [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1097.78s)]
*  the roof. Because so many people are committing suicide because their life sucks so hard that [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1102.42s)]
*  instead of fixing their life, they just put nets up. That's insane. Have you ever seen that? The [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1107.3s)]
*  Foxconn building? No. It's so dystopian. Really? They have nets at the bottom of the building? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1112.66s)]
*  All around the building. All around the outside edge of the building to keep people from jumping. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1117.46s)]
*  That's crazy. That is insane. I've tried to go to China so many times to report on it's almost [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1122.18s)]
*  impossible to get in. Yeah, they know you. That lady's not coming in. She's not coming in. That lady spills the beans. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1127.7s)]
*  Congo is really interesting. We were there for an ape story. And one of the things that happened [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1134.9s)]
*  with the rare earth minerals and all of that is that the US used to control a lot of those mines. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1140.18s)]
*  And then China, they sold them to China. And now a lot of the stuff we need for the future is in [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1146.5800000000002s)]
*  the hands of China. It's so stupid. That's very American. Yeah, very American. Yeah, very. Yeah. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1151.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's dark. It's just crazy that there's so much exploitation in that country. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1158.8200000000002s)]
*  You know, that continent is just flooded with exploitation. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1165.8600000000001s)]
*  And it's stunningly beautiful. We were doing a story about ape trafficking. And it really is, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1170.02s)]
*  it's the second largest country in Africa in terms of land. And it's got the most beautiful [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1174.9s)]
*  parks and rivers. It's stunning. It could be, you know, a huge tourism destination. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1180.26s)]
*  We had the opportunity of hiking up this Cahuzi, Vega National Park that leads up to the gorillas [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1187.38s)]
*  where we saw gorillas in the wild. And it was beautiful, beautiful, stunningly beautiful. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1193.22s)]
*  Who's trafficking in apes? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1198.58s)]
*  Well, a lot of them are ending up in the Arabian Gulf in Dubai. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1201.8600000000001s)]
*  What do they do with them? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1205.38s)]
*  They put them in private zoos that they've been in charge visitors to come and see. They put them [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1206.82s)]
*  in private homes, people that want to have exotic pets in their house. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1214.02s)]
*  Someone has a gorilla in their house? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1217.46s)]
*  Oh, they do. Gorillas go for $500,000 or more. It's a crazy gorilla that they catch in the wild. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1218.74s)]
*  And the sad part about it is that to be able to catch that gorilla, they then, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1226.02s)]
*  and the same thing with chimpanzees, they have to kill the whole family because, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1230.5s)]
*  you know, they're very social and... [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1233.86s)]
*  Baby apes are being stolen for pets. Moodle's being done to stop it. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1236.98s)]
*  $550,000 was the trade, Ben, for African great apes in China, Middle East, and Pakistan. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1240.82s)]
*  And they're being stolen. Yeah. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1247.22s)]
*  Wow. So they have to kill the whole family? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1248.34s)]
*  They kill the whole family, Joe. It's horrible. And the sad thing... [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1250.5s)]
*  Why do they have to kill the whole family? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1253.06s)]
*  Because, for example, if baby chimps, you can't carry your live chimp, for example, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1254.58s)]
*  because they're too dangerous. And so it's the Batwa pygmies we spoke. We did the whole chain of [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1259.38s)]
*  who hunts them, who kills them, who transports them, and then who buys them. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1265.78s)]
*  And we started in the park with the Batwa pygmies. You had a guest that I remember when I was doing [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1269.6200000000001s)]
*  research for this story I listened to. Didn't you have a guest here who talked... [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1275.94s)]
*  Yeah. Fight for the forgotten. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1279.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So the pygmies, you know, they've sort of lost their home, which is the forest. The [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1280.98s)]
*  Congolese government says they can't be there, and they have no money, and no schools, and no [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1286.98s)]
*  education, and nothing. Desperate situations. So these people come out and say, if you get us a [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1290.8200000000002s)]
*  baby chimp, we'll pay you $10. $10 for a baby chimp. And they go out, and the problem with [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1295.38s)]
*  baby chimps is that until they're five years old, they live at the hip of the mother, like always [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1302.26s)]
*  next to the mother. It's the way their family is. And so to be able to take and kidnap the child, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1308.66s)]
*  they have to kill the whole family because they estimate the average is like 10 chimps have to be [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1317.3s)]
*  killed in order to be able to take away one baby. Because they'll attack? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1321.94s)]
*  Because they'll attack, yeah. They won't let you leave with a baby. Yeah. It's very, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1325.86s)]
*  very sad. So we're talking to these guys who have done this. How much of a market is there? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1331.62s)]
*  Like how many are they trading? There's a lot, lots being sold. So we then went online and did [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1338.26s)]
*  this whole investigation and found that it's actually super easy. There are people online [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1343.9399999999998s)]
*  that you can reach out to, and they will get you a chimpanzee or a baby gorilla. It's crazy. And then [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1347.86s)]
*  yeah, and then they're transported in sometimes private planes to these places. And then, you know, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1353.78s)]
*  tourists in Dubai can take photos with little baby chimps or baby gorillas. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1359.14s)]
*  I'm sure you know about that lady in Connecticut that had a full-grown chimpanzee in her home. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1366.42s)]
*  And then her friend came over and the chimp decided he didn't like her friend, so he ripped [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1370.8200000000002s)]
*  her face off, tore apart. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're ruthless. They are. Yeah. You shouldn't have one in [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1374.9s)]
*  your home. Yeah. For sure. And you're not going to stop them unless you shoot them. They're so [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1382.26s)]
*  powerful. There's not a damn thing you can do to stop them from ripping your face off. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1386.9s)]
*  Yeah. It's the Dock Antle of it all, you know. Remember Dock Antle? Tiger King? Do you remember [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1390.98s)]
*  that guy? Yeah. A lot of them, it's basically people around the world wanting to be Dock Antle [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1397.7800000000002s)]
*  and having like a private safari that celebrities come to. What a bizarre need, a bizarre want, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1402.66s)]
*  have a bunch of locked up exotic primates in cages that you can just stare at. But also what a bizarre [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1409.7s)]
*  need it is that we want to take photos and selfies with tigers and apes. Like why? I went to a tiger [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1417.8600000000001s)]
*  sanctuary in Thailand with my family a few years back. And the beginning is kind of cool because [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1425.22s)]
*  the beginning you're around the kittens and the cubs are like super energetic and they're jumping [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1431.7800000000002s)]
*  around and attacking things. These little tiny tigers, they're really cool. But it's just like, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1438.58s)]
*  wow. And there's a lot of people in the room to make sure that the tigers don't go crazy. And [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1443.1399999999999s)]
*  they're little. And then it gets to a slightly larger tiger. And there's men with sticks and [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1447.54s)]
*  you could sit there. There's like a picture of my daughter when she was 10. She's like, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1453.06s)]
*  they're smiling. She's sitting next to a tiger, a small tiger. It's like 40 pounds or something [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1456.02s)]
*  like that. Then when they get bigger, they're drugged. So these people go in the cage with [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1460.1s)]
*  this massive tiger and the tiger is just like. They're just all fucking heroined out. And these [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1465.38s)]
*  people take selfies. And it was so sad. I'm like, we have to leave. I'm so depressed. Do you remember [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1471.6200000000001s)]
*  the name of that place? I do not. It was in Chiang Mai. Yeah. It's really sad. And the babies are [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1476.8200000000002s)]
*  also taken from their mothers. You're not supposed to be handling baby cubs that young. Yes. All of [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1483.8600000000001s)]
*  it is bad. Exactly. It's all bad. But it's just like, I didn't realize they were drugged. I thought [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1489.7s)]
*  they just fed them a lot and the tigers are cool. Nope. No, no, they're drugged. They're really [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1494.58s)]
*  drugged. Like you see them there just like not, they don't move at all. They just lay around. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1500.74s)]
*  So they just get these tigers hooked on heroin. Is it heroin? I mean, it must be, must be some sort [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1505.3799999999999s)]
*  of an opiate, something like that. Morphine, something, something that just conks them out. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1512.02s)]
*  So they were just sitting there like nodding. And these is massive, gorgeous apex predator. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1517.22s)]
*  And it's all just so that people can take pictures with them. And so you decided to leave? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1523.3s)]
*  Yeah. I'm like, no, we're not going there. I got weirded out when we got to the mid-sized cats [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1527.62s)]
*  because I was like, that cat is a little dangerous. Even though it's only like 40 pounds, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1533.3s)]
*  they're still a little sketchy. Like this is a little weird. And I went in there and I was like, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1537.1399999999999s)]
*  it seems like it's okay. Let's just say, take a picture real quick. Let's get out of here. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1541.46s)]
*  But then when you get to the big cats, it's like massive depression sets in. You're like, oh no. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1544.82s)]
*  So terrible. Yeah. Because I'm just enamored with cats, especially tigers. I just think [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1549.7s)]
*  nature created like the most beautiful, terrifying thing. I mean, if a tiger wasn't real, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1556.8999999999999s)]
*  it's right out of Avatar. I mean, with their insane colorations and their fangs and the way they can [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1564.34s)]
*  leap their capabilities. I'm sure you've seen that video of the guy who was on the elephant [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1572.82s)]
*  and the tiger leaps through the grass and gets him while he's on the, you ever seen that? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1576.42s)]
*  No. Oh, it's one of my favorites. Because this guy is in India and he's on this elephant and [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1579.8600000000001s)]
*  he's riding this elephant and you see the grass move ahead of him. And this tiger leaps like 15 [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1585.22s)]
*  feet in the air and slashes at this guy. And he's just lucky he got out of it with just getting cut [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1591.54s)]
*  up. Watch this. Oh my goodness. A nightmare. So the guy's on the elephant. Look at this cat. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1598.02s)]
*  Oh my God. Look how it leaps. I mean, look at the size of this thing. But watch out. And he's like, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1602.66s)]
*  he's always got like a little stick. Oh my God. He's like, stop. Don't do this to me. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1609.78s)]
*  Don't do it. Look at that thing. Just catch air. Look at it catch air. Like, oh my God. It just [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1614.74s)]
*  flies at him. Holy shit. And swipes and just ripped his arm apart. That is insane. Yeah. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1621.94s)]
*  Raise his arm apart. Yeah, at the end of it, his arms are capped down. That is insane. Oh my God. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1628.74s)]
*  Such a terrifying creature. That scares me to death. When people always ask if I'm scared of [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1635.7s)]
*  the work that I do meeting, I'm much more scared of animals than I am of people. Well, there's a [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1642.82s)]
*  place in India called the Sundarbans. And the problem with that area is that tigers have been [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1646.9s)]
*  actively targeting people there for over 100 years. And so I think the numbers of the last [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1653.22s)]
*  100 years, 300,000 people there have been killed by tigers. Oh my, that is insane. Yeah. And people [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1659.14s)]
*  that just live there and work, probably farmers that are working in the farms. Just villagers. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1666.34s)]
*  Well, there's a bunch of things that happens. One, the typhoons come in and people die and they [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1669.94s)]
*  drown and they wind up in the river and the tigers eat them. And then two, there's an issue. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1674.58s)]
*  Three hundred people and 46 tigers have been killed since 2000 in human tiger conflicts in [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1679.38s)]
*  the Sundarbans. They've done a lot to mitigate it. That's only the last, that's since 2000. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1685.7s)]
*  That's over the last 23 years. It used to be a lot worse. And also the problem is that the water [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1693.38s)]
*  is brackish. And so the tigers are drinking salt water and apparently it irritates them. It's like [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1699.38s)]
*  very painful. So you got these angry, pissed off tigers that actively hunt humans. And so these guys [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1706.66s)]
*  that go out to try to survey, they're always trying to figure out how many tigers are there. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1715.6200000000001s)]
*  They have to wear these helmets that protect the back of their heads and the helmet have a mask on [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1720.42s)]
*  the back of the head so that the tigers like to sneak up on you. And if they see your face, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1726.42s)]
*  they're less likely to attack. They like to attack you when your back is turned. So they have these [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1731.9399999999998s)]
*  helmets with a mask on the back to confuse the tigers. And what are they doing to try and protect [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1738.26s)]
*  the villagers now? Guns, that's it. I mean what are they going to do? There's so many of them. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1742.74s)]
*  I mean it's where they live and it's like a dense jungle. So good luck finding all of them. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1748.58s)]
*  That's so crazy. We did a story on tiger trafficking in season one I think. And we spent a night in [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1753.1399999999999s)]
*  Thailand in one of these jungles where the last remaining tigers in Thailand are. And I mean we [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1760.74s)]
*  were camping out with hammocks and I didn't sleep at all because we've been spending the days, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1766.82s)]
*  they're showing us videos of the camera, the little cameras that they have activated all [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1771.78s)]
*  throughout the park, the jungle, so that when they step on it, it activates right? So you see the [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1777.3s)]
*  tigers in the wild and they're beautiful. But then you have to sleep the night there. I didn't sleep [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1781.46s)]
*  at all. It was the worst night of my life. Yeah. God. It's an amazing animal though. I mean it's [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1787.62s)]
*  fascinating and incredible that they exist. But this desire that people have to kidnap them and [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1795.06s)]
*  bring them to America and put them in a cage so they could just point to them and stare at them. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1801.54s)]
*  It's crazy. Weird. Yeah. It's really weird. Yeah. It is very strange. Yeah. People again, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1805.22s)]
*  but people that go to these places as well to take photos. I don't get it. What else did you [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1811.3799999999999s)]
*  cover this season? The season was a good one. We started the first episode, we went back to my [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1817.54s)]
*  hometown, Portugal. We did an episode on hash, hash trafficking. Most Americans don't know a lot [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1822.1s)]
*  about hash actually. Most Americans, you don't know. But it's the first drug that people in [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1829.46s)]
*  Europe usually try. It's the marijuana of Europe, we'd say. Well, it is THC, right? It is. Yeah. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1842.1s)]
*  It's from the resin glands. Yeah. It's a super, super, super potent. Super potent. Yeah. So it's [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1848.34s)]
*  the first drug I tried, the first drug that any of my friends in Portugal tried. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1854.4199999999998s)]
*  Back then when I was a kid and trying hash for the first time, I always sort of wondered, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1859.6999999999998s)]
*  where does this come from? And we knew that it was Morocco. Everybody knows that the majority of [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1864.6599999999999s)]
*  hash in the world comes from Morocco. But now I thought, wow, the unique opportunity to actually [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1868.34s)]
*  go and try to figure out how it gets here. And so we started in Portugal and I reached out to a [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1872.6599999999999s)]
*  bunch of my girlfriends in Portugal and said, hey, let's meet at this time in the rocks where we used [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1878.4199999999998s)]
*  to like hang out and hide and smoke hash. And we'll film a scene of us talking about while we're [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1882.82s)]
*  smoking. So I actually smoked on camera for the first time, did drugs on camera. In Portugal, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1891.3799999999999s)]
*  it's all decriminalized. Yeah, it's been decriminalized since 2001. So completely legal [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1896.1s)]
*  to do. And it's an amazing success story. Amazing success story. In terms of addiction, crime, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1900.02s)]
*  violence, everything went down. HIV rates, incarceration. Amazing. All of it. Yeah. So [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1905.06s)]
*  what they did is they decriminalized it. So you can use if you're caught using any drug, even hard [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1909.9399999999998s)]
*  drugs, nothing happens to you, but you're not allowed to traffic or sell it. But if you're [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1915.78s)]
*  caught, they basically give you the option. If you're caught smoking or doing heroin, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1921.54s)]
*  they'll ask you, you know, instead of they realize that they will pay much more by putting somebody [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1926.98s)]
*  in prison than they will by actually giving them treatment. So if they see that you're [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1932.02s)]
*  using heroin, they can go up to you and say, look, we'll give you the opportunity. Do you want to go [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1937.22s)]
*  to prison or do you want to go to treatment? The vast majority of people will say treatment. And [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1941.3799999999999s)]
*  the government actually pays less for treatment than they do for incarceration. So it's wild. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1944.8999999999999s)]
*  And you'd think that, you know, people would have used this example and it would have spread [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1950.74s)]
*  around the world. Well, the problem with America is the system is it's so deeply in just that [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1955.86s)]
*  there's privatized prisons and there's union guards. So the guards union, the prison guards [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1962.1s)]
*  union actively campaigned to stop drugs from being decriminalized and made legal because that would [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1968.82s)]
*  take them out of work. And the private prison complex. Yeah, it's a business. They use human [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1977.62s)]
*  beings as batteries to generate money. Yeah. Just put them inside this box and you can generate [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1985.3799999999999s)]
*  money with human beings. So you find reasons to put them in. I'm sure you heard about that. There [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1992.02s)]
*  was a judge in Pennsylvania that got arrested because he was sending children to prison. He [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=1997.2199999999998s)]
*  was sending children to juvenile detention centers that were innocent. And he just like every kid [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2003.78s)]
*  that went through his court system, he just shipped away. You got a kickback. Yeah. Right. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2008.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So this guy, how many lives did he ruin? Who knows? And how many lives did they ruin [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2014.42s)]
*  because of the abuse that they suffered? They wound up having this tortured existence and they [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2018.74s)]
*  went out and committed more crimes and ruined more lives. And it's one fucking judge. Yeah, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2023.38s)]
*  it's sick. And it's the wrong people that end up going to prison. Well, that guy, unfortunately, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2028.42s)]
*  did go to prison, the judge. But how many similar situations are there out there? How many people [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2032.9s)]
*  have not been caught? How many people are more subtle about it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2039.0600000000002s)]
*  twisted. It's horrible. It's really bad. So this, when they go and they kidnap these chimpanzees [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2043.5400000000002s)]
*  and kill their families, is there anything that's being done to stop this? Are there like [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2053.46s)]
*  organizations that go out and police? Is there anything? Yeah, there's definitely a bunch of [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2061.2999999999997s)]
*  organizations. We spent time with one called Conserve Congo. It's a local Congolese man who's [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2066.74s)]
*  trying to sort of investigate and stop it. We also spent one of the best days of filming was spent [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2072.42s)]
*  when we went to see the gorillas. We spent time with these park rangers. This guy is incredible, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2078.18s)]
*  who's basically devoted his life to trying to protect these gorillas. So they go out with AK-47s [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2083.8599999999997s)]
*  every day up in the mountains and go up and spend time with this family, these families of gorillas [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2088.74s)]
*  to try make sure that no one is coming and hurting them. But it's really dangerous work. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2093.62s)]
*  It takes resources. The hope is that they can sort of turn a little bit of this area of the Congo to [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2100.18s)]
*  what has Rwanda nowadays. You can go to Rwanda and you can go to Uganda and see gorillas. And as [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2107.3799999999997s)]
*  tourists, you can pay a lot of money, but it provides jobs and helps the local economy. So [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2112.8199999999997s)]
*  basically the idea is that you dissuade poachers from coming in and you give up jobs to people [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2118.98s)]
*  who would otherwise perhaps become poachers. And so yeah, that's being done. And yeah, it was [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2125.3s)]
*  actually incredible when we spent, I don't know, like three hours hiking through very thick jungle [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2131.94s)]
*  and then suddenly you're seeing the signs that the gorillas are there. You're seeing [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2139.46s)]
*  they, you know, their poop is there. They nested here and he's telling us along the way, but you're [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2143.7s)]
*  still unsure if you're actually going to see a gorilla. And sometimes, and suddenly they're [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2148.66s)]
*  completely nonchalant. They say, oh, it's right here. I was like, what? And there's this huge [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2152.3399999999997s)]
*  silverback gorilla just sitting there. And the whole family is there. They had had a baby. The [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2157.22s)]
*  mother had had a baby just the week before. And this is, you know, animals that are being pushed [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2163.94s)]
*  to the brink of extinction. So it was really special. It was a week of celebration at the park [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2168.66s)]
*  and we saw the little baby and there was a moment that we're filming and my producer and my team is [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2173.86s)]
*  like next to me and then another huge gorilla comes jumping and rushes right by them. So they don't [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2178.9s)]
*  bother people at all? No. So I think that they have to be become used to the presence of humans. So a [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2186.5s)]
*  lot of the park rangers job is actually to get them to get used to presence with the hope that [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2192.18s)]
*  they can bring in tourism again. So I think that's part of what they do. So this family of gorillas [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2198.18s)]
*  was used to people and they don't bother you at all. And we were this distance from the gorilla, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2204.2599999999998s)]
*  me to you. And I was just looking at them. What country the traffickers coming from? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2209.06s)]
*  Most of them, the hunters are from the Congo. They're the pygmies, the Batra pygmies. The middlemen [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2213.06s)]
*  are Congolese men that see an opportunity. And then the buyers, which is the problem always lies [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2219.22s)]
*  on demand, right? Are from the Gulf countries, the majority of them. But it's not very different [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2224.66s)]
*  from all the other trades and the tigers that you can see at Dock Hansel's facility and all that. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2232.18s)]
*  We blame ourselves as well here. Yeah, I guess. People are so weird. So weird and cruel. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2237.06s)]
*  So weird. Wait, you talked about hash for a second. You've tried hash. Yeah. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2244.98s)]
*  And it's great. Yeah. I like it. It's you think it is stronger than weed. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2249.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, it's just concentrated. Yeah. You know, it's like high THC. It's resin. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2256.2599999999998s)]
*  And if you saw how it's made, it's incredible. We went up to the Kif mountains in Morocco. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2260.8199999999997s)]
*  They basically, it's these like farmers and they beat these drums so that the resin and the little [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2268.74s)]
*  seeds come out and then they mix it all into like this paste. And yeah, it's actually a beautiful [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2274.98s)]
*  process. Very dangerous because obviously when there's a lot of money, black markets. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2281.38s)]
*  Yeah. What do they do with the rest of the plant, the leaves and all that stuff? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2286.1s)]
*  I think they don't use it. It was just there. They dry the whole plant and the leaves and then [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2290.26s)]
*  yeah, it's this like drum process where the stuff they want falls to the bottom. And then [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2294.98s)]
*  I wonder why some countries gravitated towards that method of using cannabis and not just [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2300.1s)]
*  smoking it like they do in most of the country, most of the world. Yeah. And I wonder what came [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2307.62s)]
*  first. I don't know either. Yeah. But I'd probably think that hash came first and then really the [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2312.2599999999998s)]
*  Americans came up with weed. I'm not sure. I don't know. I bet it was the opposite. I bet weed came [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2317.54s)]
*  first. It's a strange thing that it's still illegal in so many parts of the world and then [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2322.02s)]
*  fentanyl isn't. Right. Heroin isn't or opiates aren't. Yeah. Oxycontin. Yeah. Yeah. I know. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2333.94s)]
*  It's wild. Yeah. Well, I mean, unfortunately, because of our prison industrial complex, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2340.9s)]
*  I just don't see a mass decriminalization akin to what's happening in Portugal, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2347.54s)]
*  despite of what's going on on our southern border and the fentanyl trafficking and the fact that [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2353.2999999999997s)]
*  it's propping up these cartels and they're worth billions and billions of dollars. They are. Because [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2358.42s)]
*  of that. And they're mixing it in all sorts of drugs, as you know. We're working on an episode [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2364.8199999999997s)]
*  on fentanyl. We've got the whole opiate crisis and everything, but. Smoking did not become common [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2369.46s)]
*  in old world until after the introduction of tobacco in the 1500s. Hashish was consumed as an [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2374.5s)]
*  edible in the Muslim world. Interesting. Oh, the first. Yeah. First attestation of the term Hashish [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2380.42s)]
*  is a pamphlet published in Cairo in 1123. Current era. Accusing Nizari Muslims of being hashish [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2389.22s)]
*  eaters. The cult of Nizari militants, which emerged after the fall of the Fatimid caliphate [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2397.94s)]
*  is commonly called the sect of the assassins, a corruption of Hashish in Persian for hashish smokers. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2405.14s)]
*  Wow. So assassins. A corruption of the order of the assassins. Simply the assessor Nizari. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2414.02s)]
*  Is that the original term of assassin? Is that where it came from? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2422.18s)]
*  I don't know. See, I mean, this might take a little more. Yeah. How weird. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2428.1s)]
*  Huh? I mean, that would be like the modern term assassination is believed to stem from the tactics [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2435.2999999999997s)]
*  used by the assassins. Wow. So it's all about hash. Assassin comes from hash. That's nuts. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2440.8199999999997s)]
*  We did an episode on assassins this season as well. Oh, really? Yeah. That was wild. That was [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2450.5s)]
*  insane. I mean, obviously, it's a subject matter that I've wanted to do for a long time. It's [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2456.98s)]
*  almost an impossible one to do for many reasons, as you can imagine. But we actually found, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2463.86s)]
*  all started with an interview that we did with an assassin in LA. Yeah. About 15 minutes from [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2468.2599999999998s)]
*  my house in LA. And we have a contact in LA that whenever we're looking at the black markets, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2474.18s)]
*  we contact him and ask him, hey, do you know anyone who's basically making meth or drugs or [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2483.14s)]
*  guns or whatnot? And, you know, on the off chance that he knew an assassin, we contacted him. And [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2488.1s)]
*  he said he actually did. He knew a guy. He didn't think he was going to talk to us, but maybe he [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2494.18s)]
*  did because he was close to him. And eventually this guy agreed to talk to us and we met him in [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2499.06s)]
*  the corner. And as we're driving there, so we're driving there with our local contactist taking us [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2505.2999999999997s)]
*  to meet this guy. And he told us, hey, be very careful. This guy is like, the way he said it is, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2510.34s)]
*  he's bipolar, kinda. Like he acts as if he's bipolar in one moment, he's happy in the next, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2516.98s)]
*  he can just freak out and nobody knows why. He's really hard, difficult to deal with. And I asked [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2521.62s)]
*  him, are you sure he's an assassin or is it possible that he's just boasting? That happens [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2527.3s)]
*  sometimes. And he said, no, no, no, I've seen this guy being offered $80,000 to go and kill someone. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2532.42s)]
*  And I know this is what he does. Everybody knows this guy in his community, in his group. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2537.78s)]
*  So he operates in America? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2542.5s)]
*  He does. I asked him where he's based in LA, but he says it's all over the United States mainly. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2544.1000000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2550.66s)]
*  And he, yeah, as soon as I met him, he took out his gun and he said, you guys, if this is a fucking [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2551.46s)]
*  setup, you guys are all, it's going to be really easy to kill you all right now. And it was me and [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2558.66s)]
*  three or four other people. And my fear, we told him we're not, it's not a setup. So I just came [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2562.9s)]
*  here because I trust my buddy, but you know, you don't fuck me. If the police shows up, you guys [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2569.14s)]
*  are all dead. So we're in a corner of LA, close to downtown. And I'm constantly looking at the [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2573.7s)]
*  end of the road thinking if the police shows up for any reason, he's going to think it's us. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2581.7s)]
*  And this is not good. So yeah, it was a quick interview, but a chilling one. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2587.54s)]
*  How many people has this guy whacked? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2592.8199999999997s)]
*  He said, he said more than 10. He didn't say exactly how many. I asked him. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2595.3799999999997s)]
*  I also asked, started asking him personal questions about, do you have a family? Because he was saying [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2600.5s)]
*  he doesn't kill women or children. I asked him, but do you have kids? And you realize like, what [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2604.5s)]
*  would it be like for your kids to live without you? If you're doing the same to other kids, right? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2609.94s)]
*  He got really mad at my questions and said, don't fucking ask me emotional questions or something [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2614.1000000000004s)]
*  like that, personal questions. And this interview is over and left. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2618.98s)]
*  What was his background? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2623.1400000000003s)]
*  What was his background? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2624.5s)]
*  He said, he came from a really tough family. And that, yeah, involved in drugs and guns and all of [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2626.66s)]
*  it. And he, I think, realized early on that he could do this. And a lot of other people can't. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2634.98s)]
*  And he was able to do it. And he gets well paid and he does it. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2640.5s)]
*  How does one even apply to a job? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2643.46s)]
*  Yeah. And you, I mean, that was my fear when we started looking into this story, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2645.14s)]
*  because it's a little bit of a Hollywood myth, right? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2648.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2650.82s)]
*  And all those stories that you can go on the dark web and find an assassin, most of that is bullshit. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2651.3s)]
*  So that was my fear. But I do trust this contact. And we actually then ended up going to South [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2657.7000000000003s)]
*  Africa that has one of the highest assassination rates in the world and spent time with a bunch [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2663.3s)]
*  of different inkabi, which are as they are called in South Africa. And that was fucking crazy as [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2667.7000000000003s)]
*  well. So we spent time with one, his name is Jojo, young guy. And his story is insane. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2674.7400000000002s)]
*  That he was a lot nicer, a lot more approachable, but has killed like over 30 people and gets paid [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2680.58s)]
*  $1,500 per hit. And thousands of people have died in just the past few years at the hands of [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2686.58s)]
*  assassins in South Africa. And a lot of it happens in the taxi industry. So there's like 70%, I think, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2693.7799999999997s)]
*  of commuters in South Africa commute on these taxis. Basically, it's like these vans. And [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2702.2599999999998s)]
*  they're worth a lot of money. And it's sort of a cash business. And the owners of these taxi companies [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2708.1s)]
*  are routinely being killed. So we spent time with a taxi owner who owns one of these companies. And [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2713.94s)]
*  he had a bullet for AK-47 on his head that he showed us. It was a $1 million prize for anyone [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2719.46s)]
*  who killed him. And this is a crazy guy. And his rivals were just across the street with all their [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2727.22s)]
*  taxis, the other company that he says are trying to kill him. So he's surrounded by bodyguards with [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2733.3s)]
*  AK-47s at all times. And he was like, do you want to go across the street with me and film me as I [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2738.1800000000003s)]
*  get close to the other guys and see what happens? It's like, sure. So we start walking towards the [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2744.82s)]
*  rivals. And immediately, there's a group of heavily armed men walking towards us, immediately, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2750.1800000000003s)]
*  within like seconds. And this happens every day. Like people are killed every day. And then back [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2755.94s)]
*  to the assassin. And they don't have a hard time talking to you about this? I would think that [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2762.58s)]
*  there's no upside to them discussing this with you. But potentially, they could get caught. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2767.86s)]
*  Yeah. We go through a lot to make sure that we protect their identities. But I think Jojo, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2772.8199999999997s)]
*  this assassin, is a good example of why they talk to us. So we spent an hour and a half, more or less, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2780.66s)]
*  two hours talking to him. And he tells us the story of how he became an assassin. His parents [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2785.2999999999997s)]
*  were killed when he was young. He was about nine years old or something. He felt like he was left [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2789.78s)]
*  with no protection. He started carrying a knife. And his parents were killed by an assassin, by the [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2795.46s)]
*  way, as well. And then eventually, he got involved in the drug business. And then eventually, people [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2800.82s)]
*  were paying him much more money to go out and kill. And he says, yeah, at the beginning, I had to get [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2806.98s)]
*  drugged and drunk to be able to do it. But now I'm used to it. I'm cold-blooded. And I'm used to it. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2812.34s)]
*  And we started talking about the cycle of violence, right? Because he also said he doesn't [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2818.42s)]
*  kill women and children. And I asked him, but do you realize that you are traumatized from the [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2822.02s)]
*  experience that you had that your parents were killed? And now you're doing the same thing to [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2827.78s)]
*  other kids. He's like, I actually never thought of that. And then he started talking about, hey, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2831.14s)]
*  he really wants to quit. And he's been thinking, but he can't get a job and all of that. So I think [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2835.3s)]
*  people talk to us for a variety of reasons. I think there's a lot of boasting, a lot of people [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2841.7000000000003s)]
*  that want to just talk about what they do. Sometimes their families don't even know they [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2846.42s)]
*  do what they do. I think in places like Sinaloa, where I've spent a lot of time with a cartel, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2849.7000000000003s)]
*  it's impunity. They don't see a downside because the authorities aren't really going to do anything, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2854.5s)]
*  even if they know who they are. Wow. How do you feel safe in a place like that? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2859.46s)]
*  I sometimes feel in certain countries safer. In Sinaloa, for example, if you are [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2866.34s)]
*  if you've been given the green light to go into the cartel, the territory controlled by the [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2877.06s)]
*  cartel to talk to cartel members. And it takes weeks, months, sometimes years to get that access. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2882.7400000000002s)]
*  Once we're under their protection, we're under their protection. We have their protection to be [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2889.46s)]
*  there. But then certain things happen. We were filming in Sinaloa once and we're filming these [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2894.34s)]
*  sicarios and they have their walkie talkies. And so they're communicating with the whole group and [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2901.38s)]
*  they know everybody that comes in and out of their territory. And suddenly they started panicking [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2906.98s)]
*  because the Marines had a helicopter coming their way. And the Marines in Mexico are known to shoot [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2910.98s)]
*  first and ask questions after. And they started freaking out and they basically jumped into the [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2916.1800000000003s)]
*  cars and left us. And we didn't know what to do. Should we go after them? And they're going to think [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2921.78s)]
*  we're part of the group and they can start shooting at us or should we stay behind? But we were [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2925.94s)]
*  in an open area in a sort of forested area. Should we try to hide? And then we're going to [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2930.58s)]
*  really look suspicious. So it was crazy. What did you do? We got in a car and followed them [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2936.42s)]
*  and then spent the day with them doing cocaine all day because it wasn't safe for us to leave [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2942.58s)]
*  until the night. So they just do cocaine all the time? They do a lot of cocaine. And funny story, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2947.14s)]
*  my director of photography, Fred Manu, who is the director of photography for Bourdain on [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2952.74s)]
*  Parts Unknown before, and he got, we were filming the scene and we driven into the Sierra Madre [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2958.34s)]
*  Mountains and then we had to walk for a mile or two to a place where they felt comfortable [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2965.06s)]
*  showing us their guns and they were going to start shooting and give us the interview of why [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2971.7000000000003s)]
*  it was the story about the American guns flowing down south and how they're used in the violence. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2976.6600000000003s)]
*  And he was walking there and suddenly Fred basically turns to us and says, I don't feel good. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2982.7400000000002s)]
*  And he had a massive case of what is it that you call it? The revenge. Oh, monazuma. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2988.42s)]
*  Massive case. And so we walked to the place, Fred's on the floor. They managed to put like [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=2996.98s)]
*  some sort of cloth on the floor for him. He's like walk on the floor, can barely breathe, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3002.82s)]
*  is like puking and going to the bathroom and all of it is happening at the same time. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3008.34s)]
*  And the guy is constantly offering him cocaine and telling him, dude, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3012.5s)]
*  dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3016.18s)]
*  this will fix you, my friend. You have no idea. Do this. I am telling you, Fred did not take the [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3017.38s)]
*  cocaine. But the cocaine have helped him. He thinks he was absolutely sure the cocaine would [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3023.54s)]
*  have helped him. I don't know. What if it did? Yeah. That's the cure. What else is in the cocaine? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3028.02s)]
*  We don't know. These guys are probably getting pure cocaine. Oh yeah. I'm sure. Yeah. Why would [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3033.46s)]
*  they cut it? And they're snorting it all day long. Oh my God. And then it wasn't, it wasn't actually [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3038.5s)]
*  very good idea for us to stay with them for so long. It was a learning lesson for all of us [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3042.66s)]
*  because that night we were filming with them in a bunker where they kept a lot of their guns. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3046.98s)]
*  And one of them had been snorting cocaine all day and basically pulled the trigger on the floor. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3052.8199999999997s)]
*  And the bullet came out just like two inches from Fred's head because he was in the bunker [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3058.8999999999996s)]
*  right in that hole. And it could have been really bad. Oh Jesus. Yeah. So don't. Coked up [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3064.5s)]
*  sicarios in Mexico. Oh my goodness. Yeah. And how often are those guys killing people? Oh very [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3071.06s)]
*  often. They also told us all. So they're not considered assassins per se. They're sicarios. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3080.02s)]
*  They're hitmen, right? Because they're not, it's part of what they do for the cartel amongst many [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3086.02s)]
*  other things like transporting drugs and guns and all of it. But yeah, a lot of people. And he also [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3090.66s)]
*  told me this story. You have the first person he ever killed and he was ordered to kill and it was [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3095.2999999999997s)]
*  a friend of his. He went to his house and knocked on the door and the guy opens the door and he [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3099.38s)]
*  shoots him and the guy is yelling, don't kill me, don't kill me, and shoots him right in the face. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3103.1400000000003s)]
*  Oh boy. Yeah. Terrible. That's all what happens when you make drugs illegal [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3107.2200000000003s)]
*  because then the criminals are selling them. Yeah. So that we can consume them. Yeah. Let's not forget. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3114.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. It's dirty. Yeah, it is dirty. It's, and I don't, you know, I've had conversations with [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3120.1800000000003s)]
*  people about this, like what is the solution in America? Because if you legalize drugs, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3128.74s)]
*  all drugs in America and sold them, like if pharmaceutical drug companies sold heroin, cocaine, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3133.2999999999997s)]
*  all that. I don't want the pharmaceutical companies involved in that. Right. Like who, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3140.5s)]
*  who sells it if it's not them? Yeah. So either the cartel sells it or they sell it or no one can sell [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3144.5s)]
*  it. Well, that's not going to be the case. Someone's going to sell it. And if you make it legal, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3150.8999999999996s)]
*  you're going to have more people doing it. Like we're not accustomed to things being legal. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3155.14s)]
*  If you made cocaine legal in this country, a bunch of people would try it. They wouldn't [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3159.46s)]
*  ordinarily try it because they wouldn't know who to get it from. They wouldn't know how to do it. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3164.1s)]
*  If you could just walk into Walgreens and buy cocaine, I guarantee you we'll have more overdoses, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3168.1s)]
*  more addicts, more. But what is the solution to that? Is it education? Does that even work? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3173.62s)]
*  Is it counseling? Is it drug rehabilitation centers everywhere? Is it Ibogaine? Like what is [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3180.5s)]
*  the, what's the solution to? Yeah, I don't know. But I think looking at the example of Portugal is [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3186.58s)]
*  a good idea. Yeah, but we're not Portugal. The problem is like what we talked about, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3191.38s)]
*  like prison guard unions, privatized prisons, the, the, the state of the mil the policing in this [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3195.3s)]
*  country and the way it's done and the amount of people that are in jail in this country is so [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3202.26s)]
*  insane. Yeah. Yeah. There's no easy answer, which is why we haven't, no one has tried to solve this. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3207.94s)]
*  And then there's this bizarre trend to let people out that have committed violent crimes in this [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3216.7400000000002s)]
*  country. It's almost like someone's engineering the deterioration of the country and like ensuring [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3221.78s)]
*  civil unrest. So they're keeping the people that for minor crimes that shouldn't be there, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3228.7400000000002s)]
*  like the guy selling weed on the corner. Well, they're not even keeping them anymore. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3235.22s)]
*  Now. No, I mean, it's like Los Angeles in particular is just nuts. It's just nuts. They [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3239.14s)]
*  have these district attorneys that are funded by George Soros and they put them in and these [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3244.2599999999998s)]
*  people, their, their mandate is to let as many people out as possible and violent crime, whatever [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3249.22s)]
*  it is, no cash bail. They're just letting people out and they're, they're letting people out of [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3255.22s)]
*  prison that are violent prisoners. What's the idea behind that? That the prison system's unjust. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3260.02s)]
*  That's the narrative. But the end result is people are unsafe because you've already created this [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3266.2599999999998s)]
*  environment with prisons and with a lifetime of crime. These people are, they're habitualized, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3272.82s)]
*  they're criminals and then they're, they've committed violent crimes and then you let them [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3279.06s)]
*  right back out on the street. Right. Yeah, it's, it's wrong. I don't know enough about it, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3283.3s)]
*  but I do think that we tend to look at the problem the other way around. I think that we tend to look [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3289.78s)]
*  at how to try to stop the problem when it's already a problem without actually tackling [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3295.3s)]
*  the root causes of what is happening and why it's happening. Right. Yeah. We've talked about that [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3301.86s)]
*  many times in this podcast. Like if you wanted to solve the root cause, you would clean up in [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3305.7000000000003s)]
*  inner cities. That's what you would do. You'd take these crime-ridden, drug-ridden, gang-infested [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3309.94s)]
*  communities and you'd invest in a massive amount of money and resources into fixing and rehabilitating [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3315.7000000000003s)]
*  them. Yeah. And the money that we have spent just in the Ukraine War could have done that [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3321.46s)]
*  many times over in this country and they've not lifted a finger to stop it. It's almost like [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3327.2200000000003s)]
*  there's a formula to ensure control and power and you need a certain amount of crime and violence. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3333.86s)]
*  You need a certain amount of people in prison. You need a certain amount of despair [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3340.82s)]
*  in the inner cities to ensure that people don't rise up and figure out the system and [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3344.82s)]
*  realize they've been screwed over. Yeah. Also talking about security helps a lot of politicians, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3348.6600000000003s)]
*  right? Oh yeah. They have something that they're going to do to make it better. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3353.7000000000003s)]
*  Both of those things are true. Yeah. Yeah. Prop up the problem so you can offer you as the solution. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3356.58s)]
*  Right. Yeah. But even outside of the US, I mean these black markets, so much of it, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3362.74s)]
*  the lesson for me has always been when reporting on these black markets, it's all about inequality. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3369.7s)]
*  Your choices are only as good as the opportunities you're given. Yeah. Sure. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3377.3799999999997s)]
*  If you don't have those opportunities, you're going to become first like a watcher for the [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3382.1s)]
*  cartel and then eventually climb the ladder and become a Sicario. 100%. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3386.8999999999996s)]
*  It's the only job you have available for you. Yeah. What else are you going to do? And again, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3391.46s)]
*  if you're living in the Congo and you're in the area where they're mining cobalt, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3395.14s)]
*  what are you going to do? Yeah. You're going to start your own business? What are you going to do? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3398.66s)]
*  Right. And if your family doesn't have anything on the table to eat and they offer you $10, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3402.42s)]
*  which will feed your family for a week to go and kill the chimp, you're going to go and kill a chimp. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3409.94s)]
*  Exactly. Right. That's the biggest problem. Yeah. So what else did you investigate? How many episodes [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3414.58s)]
*  you do this year? 10. Eight are now on Hulu. Two more are coming soon. But one of them, another one, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3420.1s)]
*  cartel involvement is about fake pharmaceutical pills. That's really interesting. We spent time [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3427.86s)]
*  with a group called La Union in Mexico City where 80% of their job, of their money right now comes [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3434.74s)]
*  from fake pharmaceutical pills. And yeah, I mean, they're making these pills. And then we went to [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3440.2599999999998s)]
*  Wendy as well, which is another source of pharmaceutical pills. You have like 40,000 [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3446.34s)]
*  online pharmacies that you can go to and buy prescription drugs without a prescription. So [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3450.02s)]
*  a lot of Americans are doing that because it's much cheaper. I think it's something like 20 [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3454.34s)]
*  million Americans are using the black market for their bills, for their drugs, because they can't [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3457.94s)]
*  afford them here, which is crazy. 20 million. 20 million. It's crazy. And people that can't afford, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3462.34s)]
*  that need these medications to survive and they can't afford them here because we have the highest [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3468.42s)]
*  drug prices in the entire world. And so when you say fake, is it, it's not manufactured by, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3472.82s)]
*  you know, Pfizer or whatever, but is it the same components? It looks exactly the same, but a lot [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3479.6200000000003s)]
*  of these pills don't actually have any active ingredients. So we spent time with a guy making [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3485.94s)]
*  20,000 pills a night out of this little, you know, back house with a machine, a pill presser. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3490.5s)]
*  And he, it was just calcium and food dye to make it look the color, whatever color he wanted. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3497.22s)]
*  And he was selling it as amoxicillin and, you know, very likely ending up in American homes [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3503.54s)]
*  because they ship it all around the world. Wow. And, and in that case, you know, the good luck of [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3509.3799999999997s)]
*  the buyer is that it was just calcium, but in many cases it gets mixed with cement and rat poison and [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3516.3399999999997s)]
*  all sorts of things. They don't give a fuck. They don't give a fuck. And even worse is the [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3523.62s)]
*  cartel in Mexico, we found out there's a great LA Times investigation on this. And then we sort of [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3528.18s)]
*  started doing our own investigation, but they're mixing these drugs with fentanyl and meth. So I [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3534.2599999999998s)]
*  think it was something like 70% of the drugs that they bought and tested had actually had meth and [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3540.02s)]
*  fentanyl and Americans were crossing the border into Mexico to buy these drugs and then dying. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3544.82s)]
*  It's insane. But it's all, again, it's like easy for us to blame the cartel and other people [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3550.5s)]
*  for doing this, but it's all our fault. It's the broken system that we have in our country. Why, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3556.02s)]
*  why are we paying, you know, why are we, this woman that we filmed with, she was paying $700 [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3560.74s)]
*  for this medication that she needs and she couldn't afford it. Her health insurance was [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3566.2599999999998s)]
*  encountering it. So she would go across the border and pay $60 for it in Mexico. Of course. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3570.18s)]
*  Is any of it the real medication? Yeah, some of it is. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3575.46s)]
*  Is there a way to tell? And they're real pharmacies. But what we- [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3579.94s)]
*  So some of the real pharmacies have fake drugs? So that's what's so interesting is that even [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3582.9s)]
*  pharmacies that are real, they're completely authentic and legitimate. And that there's towns, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3587.46s)]
*  there's a town that we filmed that called Algodones, for example, that's on the other side [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3593.38s)]
*  of the Arizona border, that is, that has more hospitals and orthodontists and optician, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3597.2200000000003s)]
*  how do you say the doctor, glasses? Optometrists. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3604.42s)]
*  Optometrists than anywhere else in the world. It's basically you drive around and it's like [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3606.1s)]
*  doctor's office, pharmacy, optometrist, all of it. And it's all catering to Americans, right? And so [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3611.94s)]
*  vast numbers of Americans come every year and buy their drugs there. And there are pharmacies that [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3618.34s)]
*  are chained pharmacies that look, there could be a CVS, but in Mexico, it's not a CVS, but it could [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3621.94s)]
*  be sort of brand name that you recognize in Mexico. But what we did with the cartel is we were trying [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3626.26s)]
*  to figure out how they get their medications in these shelves. And we filmed one cartel member. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3631.14s)]
*  He allowed us to film. We couldn't go inside, but I had him, he had a mic, so I was able to listen [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3637.62s)]
*  to everything from the car. He goes into a pharmacy and basically tells the woman there like this. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3642.02s)]
*  And the meds look, we saw them making them. They look exactly like the real thing, the packaging, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3648.02s)]
*  everything. Some of it actually comes from the legitimate places that they steal from the [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3652.2599999999998s)]
*  factories, like the packaging and all of it. But they basically tell them, okay, you put this on [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3656.42s)]
*  your shelves and if you don't, we're going to burn your pharmacy. So we heard that. We saw that. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3661.54s)]
*  And so a lot of them are forced to carry them. And they're forced to carry fake drugs. Yeah. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3667.78s)]
*  And do they have any idea what's in them when they're selling them or they're just... [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3672.5s)]
*  I don't think they do. No. I doubt that they knew, for example, there was fentanyl and meth mixed in [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3676.1s)]
*  with some of their other medications because that creates a huge problem for them. And so for the [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3681.54s)]
*  consumer, how do they find the legitimate stuff? They don't, which is why it's so hard. So this [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3687.38s)]
*  woman that we followed, she goes there, she buys her medication. And I asked her, do you know what's [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3693.14s)]
*  in there? Oh, no, but it's my friend told me that it's a legitimate pharmacy. Of course, she has no [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3697.22s)]
*  idea that this is happening, that the cartel is actually threatening them to death if they don't [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3701.62s)]
*  stock their shelves with their fake pharmaceuticals. Did you take any of that stuff and test it? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3706.2599999999998s)]
*  We did. It's a lot more complicated than it seems. The LA Times, again, did an amazing [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3711.22s)]
*  investigation where they did test it. And again, I think it was something like seven or eight out of [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3717.3s)]
*  their 10 that they tested had fentanyl and meth, which was crazy. Out of two pharmacies, I think. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3721.3s)]
*  And what kind of drugs are they talking about that have fentanyl and meth in them? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3726.9s)]
*  I can't remember, but I think it was Adderall maybe. I can't remember exactly. But it was a [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3729.94s)]
*  great investigation. And yeah, in our story, we sort of looked at how it ends up in the shelves [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3736.26s)]
*  and who's making it and how it's being produced. There's an amazing doctor in Mexico City called [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3741.3s)]
*  Dr. Loco, who we spent time with, a doctor, a crazy doctor, Dr. Loco, who was a chemist himself, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3747.0600000000004s)]
*  doctor as well. And his father owned a pharmacy, so he sort of knew how to, and he showed us, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3753.78s)]
*  he's making, he's putting the little silicone pouch inside and the cotton ball that goes inside. And [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3759.5400000000004s)]
*  it looks exactly the same. Like no one would have been able to tell. God, that's so scary. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3766.02s)]
*  So scary. Yeah. Is there any evidence that that happens in America? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3772.58s)]
*  That it's being sold in America? Yeah, we went with the raid with the L.A. Sheriff's Department, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3779.3s)]
*  where we saw a sort of a grocery store in the back that was selling these medications, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3783.14s)]
*  mainly to underprivileged immigrant communities, because they couldn't sell real stuff. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3789.7s)]
*  They're not in legitimate pharmacies. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. No. But. Not yet that we know of. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3794.1s)]
*  No, not yet that we know of. But again, it's, at the end we went and visited a spokesperson for a [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3800.82s)]
*  group called Pharma that is a lobby group that represents the pharmaceutical companies. And [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3807.86s)]
*  she was very happy to talk about how counterfeit medications are very damaging for America, right? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3814.18s)]
*  Yeah, so is the real ones. And that's why I asked her, but why is it that [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3819.46s)]
*  Americans have to resort to a black market because they can't afford their medications here? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3824.26s)]
*  And that whole conversation, as you know, is fascinating. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3828.98s)]
*  Yeah, what did she say about that? Well, she says that they need the money [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3832.42s)]
*  for innovation, R&D, right? Research and development. And that's how they can get new [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3835.94s)]
*  drugs that are important for Americans. I said, that's all great. But if the Americans can't [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3840.98s)]
*  afford these medications, they're not going to be treated by them because they can't afford them. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3844.58s)]
*  And then I asked her, have you actually spent any time with any of these Americans that cannot [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3849.22s)]
*  afford their lifesaving medications? She said, no. That's the biggest problem, right? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3853.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But she keeps saying that without that expense, without that money, they wouldn't be able [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3858.98s)]
*  to look for all these new drugs, which is also BS because I think it's something like 34% or 35% [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3865.7799999999997s)]
*  of the money that was spent or it was 35% more money spent on advertisement and, you know, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3873.06s)]
*  trying to sell the drug than it was on actual R&D research and development. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3880.66s)]
*  Of course. Not only that, to say that they're not profitable after all that. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3885.06s)]
*  Oh, I mean, like a hundred billion dollars at top 10 companies in the last year alone or two years, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3890.2599999999998s)]
*  something ridiculous like that. Yeah, they make plenty. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3896.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh, it's greed. It's pure greed. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3899.2999999999997s)]
*  And it's evil. Especially, I mean, I'm sure, have you seen the Netflix series, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3902.2599999999998s)]
*  Painkiller? Peter Berg's documentary? I mean, that's how I found out about you [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3906.42s)]
*  through the OxyContin Express. I mean, what year was that? That was quite a long time ago. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3911.06s)]
*  That was 2008. When did we first talk? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3916.1s)]
*  I think 2008 or nine. It had to be nine because the podcast [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3918.98s)]
*  didn't start until nine. So it might've been nine. It might've been 10, 2010. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3922.02s)]
*  Oh, maybe. You came to the studio. I wasn't doing it in my house anymore. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3927.14s)]
*  No, you were doing it at your house. Really? The first time you did it was at my house? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3930.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm quite sure. No kidding. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3933.7s)]
*  Didn't you live like in Sherman Oaks or something? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3935.14s)]
*  Woodland Hills. Woodland Hills, yeah. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3937.06s)]
*  Yeah. I'm quite sure I went to your house. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3938.42s)]
*  That's now I'm thinking, yeah. Yeah, you were one of my first guests, I think. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3940.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3943.86s)]
*  Yeah, that OxyContin Express story was insane. And I think part of the exposure from your work [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3945.46s)]
*  led to them changing the laws because they had no database. So the way it would work, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3952.5s)]
*  I'll explain it to people, is that there was no database. So if you got a prescription from a [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3957.7s)]
*  doctor and you went in to get OxyContin, you could go to another doctor down the street and get [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3962.18s)]
*  another prescription. And they clearly had it set up like that so that there could be abuse [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3967.14s)]
*  because that was how to maximize profits. And they have these pain management centers. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3972.58s)]
*  And I used to see them when I would do stand up in Florida, where you would go and it would be [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3978.58s)]
*  called a pain management center. And it's essentially you would go to a doctor and all [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3983.7s)]
*  the doctors there is to write a prescription for OxyContin. And then you'd go right next door [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3988.26s)]
*  to their little pharmacy that they had on site and all they had was OxyContin. And you had just a [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3993.38s)]
*  parking lot filled with zombies. These people that were just like, just zonked out. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=3999.54s)]
*  Completely dying, some overdosing in the front steps. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4004.26s)]
*  Like crazy. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4007.7799999999997s)]
*  So my husband did an amazing follow-up documentary. If you remember the OxyContin Express, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4008.66s)]
*  do you remember that we were investigating this one pain clinic called American Pain? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4013.14s)]
*  And the owners were identical twins, born identical twins, and they owned this pain clinic. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4017.3799999999997s)]
*  And they followed us down I-95 because they saw us filming outside their door. And they followed [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4024.8199999999997s)]
*  us down I-95. And I'm at the wheel and I'm seeing that the gas, we're running low on gas. So I stop [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4030.5s)]
*  at the gas station and they park right behind us. And these two big guys with big muscles come out [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4039.54s)]
*  and start yelling at us. And so I take off and they follow us and keep following us. And at one [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4045.86s)]
*  point I run out of gas and I go to the side of the, and we're on a freeway on the I-95. And I'd been [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4050.82s)]
*  calling contact in law enforcement, DEA, that we'd been talking to. And she said, call 911 right [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4056.74s)]
*  now. I know these guys are bad news. Call 911 right now. So we call 911, told them what was happening. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4062.9799999999996s)]
*  We were being chased on the freeway. Eventually run out of gas, park on the side of the freeway. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4067.2999999999997s)]
*  But they were so dumbfounded as to why we're parking on the side of the freeway that they [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4072.58s)]
*  just parked behind us and don't get out of the car for a few minutes. And then the police shows up. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4076.18s)]
*  And then they come up with a silly story that they thought I was an ex-girlfriend stalking them. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4080.66s)]
*  And then we took down their license plate and my husband started looking into them. They ended up [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4085.94s)]
*  in prison at federal time. Part of it they were using, the surveillance tapes they used was part [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4092.34s)]
*  of our conversations. They were talking about us and our investigation into them and the Oxygotten [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4098.5s)]
*  Express. But my husband stayed in touch, basically wrote them a letter when they were in prison. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4103.62s)]
*  And we were deciding on whether he should say, hey, I was the guy who directed Oxygotten Express. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4109.0599999999995s)]
*  But he didn't. And he just said, hey, my name is Darren Foster. I'm a documentary filmmaker. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4113.46s)]
*  I've been fascinated by your... They ran the biggest prescription pill operation in American [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4118.02s)]
*  history. They were the Pablo Escobar of America, basically. They were making millions and millions [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4121.78s)]
*  of dollars out of a couple of storefronts in Florida. And so he contacted them and they [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4126.26s)]
*  wrote back and said, yeah, I'm interested in, by the way, say hi to your wife. So they knew [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4131.94s)]
*  full well who he was. And he ended up doing an amazing doc. It's called American Pain. You should [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4136.34s)]
*  watch it. But it's about them, the rise and fall of these twin brothers, but also the complicity [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4141.22s)]
*  of the pharmaceutical companies. And they full well knew exactly what was happening and did [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4146.26s)]
*  nothing about it. It's a great way to maximize profits. And the fact that they were taking these [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4151.3s)]
*  and buying them in bulk and buying them off all these people and then shipping them up north. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4155.7s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And then you see the trail of devastation everywhere these pharmaceutical [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4160.18s)]
*  drugs went. And all these communities that got hooked on the pills. And then when they changed [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4166.02s)]
*  regulation made them more difficult to get. Then these people started doing heroin, you know. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4170.5s)]
*  And then fentanyl. Yeah. And then the exact same thing happened. We did another documentary called [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4174.58s)]
*  Death by Fentanyl where we looked at the fentanyl and we investigated this one pharmaceutical [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4179.54s)]
*  company called Insys Pharmaceuticals and or Insys Therapeutics where they were selling subsys, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4183.7s)]
*  which was a fentanyl product. And they were doing the exact same thing that Purdue had done just, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4190.66s)]
*  you know, a few years before where they were paying doctors for fees to basically prescribe. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4197.06s)]
*  They were prescribing fentanyl to people with headaches and like shoulder pain. And we got a [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4202.580000000001s)]
*  whistleblower to tell us exactly how it was happening and how they were calling because [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4207.620000000001s)]
*  the pills or this product was really, really expensive. So insurance companies were paying [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4212.34s)]
*  for it. So she would call insurance companies and say, oh, and they would ask, but you know, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4216.34s)]
*  this is only supposed to be prescribed to cancer patients. Does this patient have cancer? And they [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4220.1s)]
*  knew how to answer in a way that the person would believe they did, even though they didn't. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4225.86s)]
*  They were making millions of dollars. It was the only executive that has ever gone to trial and been [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4230.66s)]
*  found guilty. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's sick. Are those two twins still in jail? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4235.94s)]
*  No, one of them still is. The other one left and my husband Darren was there. How did one get out? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4243.46s)]
*  They had different sentences. And I think the other one is still in federal prison. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4249.54s)]
*  But it's George, Jeff and Chris George, George's last name. And yeah, Darren was there, filmed him [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4256.74s)]
*  the day he came out. What's he doing now? They're involved in other businesses. They were involved [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4262.98s)]
*  in real estate before with their father. And then they started a, I think it was a steroids. They [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4269.299999999999s)]
*  were selling growth hormone. And then they realized, wait a second, we can be selling Oxycontin and [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4273.78s)]
*  making a lot more money from this. And literally they had like stash of cash hidden in their [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4280.02s)]
*  mother's basement. It was millions of dollars. It was insane how much money they were making. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4286.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It's a good, it's a good, it's a good doc. And it really shows you like, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4293.3s)]
*  how much do you worry about your safety? Uncovering all these things? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4296.900000000001s)]
*  Sometimes a little bit. Funnily enough, I worry more when we're going after [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4302.820000000001s)]
*  people in high positions of power than I do after, you know, months of trying to get access to the [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4309.62s)]
*  cartel, for example, and when they say yes, where it's a yes, it's a yes. But in some situations, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4318.42s)]
*  yeah, I mean, we've gotten lots of hate emails and the guy that owned that insist therapeutics, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4325.0599999999995s)]
*  for example, threatened to sue us when he saw, cause we compared him to El Chapo and said, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4332.98s)]
*  basically, he saw an opportunity in fentanyl just like El Chapo from the Sinaloa cartel saw [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4337.78s)]
*  an opportunity in selling fentanyl and how they were sort of the same in different parts. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4342.259999999999s)]
*  And they threatened to sue you for that? For the truth? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4347.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. He didn't like the fact that we were comparing him to El Chapo. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4349.3s)]
*  How can you sue someone for that? It seems like that's a... [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4352.82s)]
*  Yeah. He didn't, he didn't go far. Nothing happened. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4355.54s)]
*  Yeah. Get that in front of a jury. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4357.7s)]
*  I don't like the comparison. Yeah. Well, he didn't like to be called a drug dealer, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4361.94s)]
*  but guess what? That's exactly what he was. You're dealing drugs and you don't like being [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4366.02s)]
*  called a drug dealer. Maybe stop dealing drugs. Yeah. What do you think is the most dangerous [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4369.22s)]
*  thing that you've ever investigated? I was terrified for you when you were in the cocaine [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4376.02s)]
*  laboratories. That to me, I know you were that you were right here telling me about it, but I was [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4383.3s)]
*  like, Oh my God, she's going to die. Like when I watched that, even though I knew that you were [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4387.540000000001s)]
*  okay. I was just like, this is so insane that you did that. And that you went through the jungle [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4391.62s)]
*  with the people that were carting out the cocaine. Like you could have easily gotten killed. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4398.34s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of situations like that on the show. Like almost every episode, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4405.0599999999995s)]
*  there's a crazy situation where... Are you addicted to the thrill? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4410.34s)]
*  No, not at all. I don't do it at all. People think I adrenaline junkie. Not at all. I don't [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4413.14s)]
*  do it for the adrenaline. I'm very curious. I think as a journalist, if you tell you there's [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4418.42s)]
*  a part of the world that you can never see, that's exactly where you want to go. I also find these [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4425.22s)]
*  black markets fascinating. That's like something like half of the world's economy are these black [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4430.58s)]
*  and gray markets. And yet we know... Half of the world's economy is black and gray markets? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4434.9s)]
*  Yeah. Half? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4439.22s)]
*  Almost half. I mean, less, but it's like these black and gray markets. And gray markets can be [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4440.5s)]
*  anything from people selling counterfeit goods or anything that's basically not... Or like gray [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4444.82s)]
*  markets, basically. Cash in hand and you're not actually working in an office. So yeah, so it's a [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4450.099999999999s)]
*  lot. And no one knows anything about these worlds. And I'm fascinated not by the pointing of the [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4456.98s)]
*  finger of these guys are the bad guys and we're spending time with the bad guys, but more about [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4463.7s)]
*  what is the motivation and how is the system broken that got us to this place? Because again, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4467.299999999999s)]
*  it's trying to figure out the root cause instead of the enforcement side of it. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4473.22s)]
*  Yeah. I did not know it was that much. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4477.54s)]
*  Yeah. It is crazy. And I think this is the only show that is devoted only to black markets out [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4479.860000000001s)]
*  there. Yeah. But one of the other things you did that was terrifying was... And just terrifying to [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4485.3s)]
*  know this was that Los Angeles police were confiscating weapons and then selling them to [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4491.14s)]
*  the cartels in Mexico and that you could just go to Mexico easy. It's easy to go straight across [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4497.38s)]
*  the border into Mexico. So you can go to Mexico with a trunk full of weapons and no one stops you. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4503.62s)]
*  No, there's no control whatsoever going south, only coming north. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4510.42s)]
*  Which is wild. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4513.38s)]
*  Which is wild. I know. And guess what? These are the same guns that are being used to create the [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4514.58s)]
*  violence that create the reason why many people want to leave Mexico and come to the United States. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4520.18s)]
*  Yeah. Sort of a cycle, right? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4525.78s)]
*  God. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4528.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4529.94s)]
*  Do you think you'll ever run out of topics? [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4531.54s)]
*  No, we have so many. We have such a long list that you think people think... [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4533.78s)]
*  Are there any that you look at and you go, that's too much, that's too heavy? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4538.0199999999995s)]
*  No, not yet. Not yet. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4541.54s)]
*  Like Taliban and Afghanistan. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4543.139999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. Terrorism. You don't fuck with terrorism. That's for sure. Yeah. And that's why when we went [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4544.34s)]
*  to Niger, we only went because we knew that we were going to have military convoy with us and [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4549.46s)]
*  people protecting us because we knew. But yeah, I mean, it was months of planning because we were [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4555.78s)]
*  all... Yeah. You don't... And you still get caught in a coup. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4560.9800000000005s)]
*  And we got caught in a coup. That's the thing is like you can plan... What is there? It's like that [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4563.54s)]
*  Mike Tyson plan. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4568.9s)]
*  Everyone has a plan to get punched in the face. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4570.5s)]
*  Yes. I love that. I love that plan because that is exactly what happens with us. It's months and [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4572.26s)]
*  months of planning for shit that never happens. And what happens is always the thing you didn't [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4577.14s)]
*  prepare for or weren't ready for. Yeah. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4582.9800000000005s)]
*  Wow. What else did you cover this year? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4586.820000000001s)]
*  What else we did? We did Ape Sextortion. Have you heard of Sextortion? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4590.820000000001s)]
*  Sextortion? [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4594.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4595.46s)]
*  How does that work? [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4596.34s)]
*  That one's airing tonight actually, but it's out on Hulu already. But it's a horrible crime. It's [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4596.9800000000005s)]
*  a crime that's growing. And it's basically you start chatting with somebody online. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4603.9400000000005s)]
*  That person eventually asks you to send a photo of yourself, a compromising photo or a video of [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4611.06s)]
*  yourself, and they'll send you a photo or video back. And it's mainly targeting teens, which is [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4616.820000000001s)]
*  really sad, American teenagers. And then once you do send those photos or videos, the person says, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4622.5s)]
*  well, I have all the contact information on Facebook of all your friends and your work [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4628.02s)]
*  and your parents and your school, whatever. And I'm going to send this to everyone if you don't [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4632.02s)]
*  send us money right now. And the really sad part of that is that we spent time with parents whose [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4636.02s)]
*  kids committed suicide and within the span of a couple of days. So they started chatting online. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4642.1s)]
*  There was this kid called Jake in Utah. So sad. Was contacted by what looked like a beautiful girl [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4649.06s)]
*  on a Sunday night by Thursday or Friday. He'd committed suicide because he was too embarrassed [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4656.74s)]
*  that those his friends and his family would see those photos. It is horrible. But amazingly, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4663.219999999999s)]
*  he left behind a letter for his mother and instructions on how to access his phone so she [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4670.179999999999s)]
*  could see what had happened to him and also who he had sent money to in the hopes that she would [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4675.86s)]
*  be able to investigate or send people to investigate. And the American authorities [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4682.1s)]
*  did. They found that the people that he was sending money to were in the Philippines, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4687.38s)]
*  but that was it. There was nothing else they could do because it was a foreign country. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4691.38s)]
*  And so we set out to the Philippines and tried to figure out who it was behind this scam. And we [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4695.38s)]
*  found the whole community of people involved in the scam and scamming millions out of Americans. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4701.22s)]
*  And do they just use stock photos of girls? [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4706.66s)]
*  Yeah, stock photos of girls. A lot of them, interestingly enough, are actually trans people. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4710.0199999999995s)]
*  In the trans community, we spoke to a drag queen, for example, who was scamming a lot of people. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4715.139999999999s)]
*  And during COVID, what happened is that they usually do drag queen contests. They make money [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4721.78s)]
*  that way or work at clubs. And a lot of them lost their jobs during COVID and they had no [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4729.38s)]
*  government assistance. And so they found a way to make some money this way by extorting Americans. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4734.9s)]
*  Yeah. And that was super a crazy journey too. Just one of the scenes we filmed was we spent [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4743.219999999999s)]
*  time in a prison with a guy that was in prison for extorting Filipino women. And it was sort of the [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4752.9s)]
*  beginning of our investigation. We were trying to figure out if he was connected to anyone else, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4760.259999999999s)]
*  thinking he was like sort of small fish just extorting people in the Philippines. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4763.94s)]
*  And then while talking to him, he basically admits on camera while talking to me, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4768.98s)]
*  but actually I've done this to many, many Americans and one of them. And I asked him, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4773.54s)]
*  do you know anyone who's committed suicide? Because it's a huge problem in the U.S. He was [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4777.86s)]
*  like, yes, there was one man who was married. He was an engineer, I believe. And he committed [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4781.94s)]
*  suicide after we extorted him. And I said, how do you know? He says, because his camera laptop was [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4787.46s)]
*  on and we could see it. I was like, wait, did you not try to stop him? I was like, no, because we [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4793.62s)]
*  heard people saying that they were going to commit suicide, but they never did. So we thought he was [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4798.58s)]
*  bluffing. And then we saw him as he dies on camera. I know. I'm sorry. This is the most depressing [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4802.0199999999995s)]
*  part that you've ever done. No, it's not, unfortunately. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4810.74s)]
*  But it's horrifying. It's just horrifying the cruelty that people are capable of, [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4816.42s)]
*  that they would do to strangers just for money. And especially for young kids to take some [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4822.259999999999s)]
*  teenagers, some easily manipulated kid, trick them into doing something. Or the desperation [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4827.7s)]
*  also that leads to it. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Right. Like that's your only option to do that. Yeah. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4835.94s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Yeah, that was a heavy one. Yeah, but... [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4843.62s)]
*  But I mean, sextortion is essentially the whole theme behind this whole Jeffrey Epstein thing. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4851.46s)]
*  That was just a massive intelligence operation to compromise very wealthy and powerful people [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4857.06s)]
*  and to probably influence all sorts of things. If you have a bunch of information on someone, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4864.5s)]
*  videotapes of someone. You think that's what he was doing? 100%. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4872.5s)]
*  That he was filming powerful people having sex with girls and then... [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4876.18s)]
*  Probably underage girls. Really? Is this out? Is this public information? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4880.58s)]
*  This is what the whole Jeffrey Epstein thing is about. Yeah. You didn't know that? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4885.3s)]
*  I mean, I knew that he was flying people, powerful people to an island, but I didn't know that he [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4888.9800000000005s)]
*  was filming without their knowledge. Yeah. Yeah. That's the story. The story was that the whole [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4894.1s)]
*  thing was an intelligence operation and that what they were doing was compromising these people. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4900.18s)]
*  You get them to go there. A bunch of celebrities are going to be there. A bunch of wealthy people [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4904.5s)]
*  are going to be there. A bunch of famous scientists are going to be there. Everyone's having a [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4908.34s)]
*  wonderful time and you figure like, oh, look, all these Nobel Prize winning scientists and Nobel [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4912.34s)]
*  laureates and actors and singers, all these people are going to be there. This sounds like a great [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4917.06s)]
*  place to be. This guy, he gets endorsed by all these other people. Oh, Jeffrey Epstein is this [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4922.900000000001s)]
*  wonderful billionaire philanthropist and he's just very eccentric and he loves to have these [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4927.94s)]
*  incredible parties and all the most interesting people. Then you go there and next thing you know, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4933.0599999999995s)]
*  you're doing drugs and you lose your little inhibitions and there's a bunch of lovely [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4937.299999999999s)]
*  young ladies. You don't know how old they are and they take you into a room and film you and now [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4942.419999999999s)]
*  he's got the goods on you. Wait, this lasted so long. Why do you think people would have [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4946.74s)]
*  talked about it to each other? Like say, don't go to that island because this guy is- [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4952.419999999999s)]
*  I think the opposite. I think once they have information on you, they get you to talk to [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4955.86s)]
*  other people. We would like to meet this guy. Why don't you bring him? Come get him to come hang out [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4960.98s)]
*  with us. Then now you've got that guy. Maybe you've got some guy who's on a television show and a news [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4966.42s)]
*  channel and he's talking. Then you've got some guy who's a scientist and he's talking to other [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4973.139999999999s)]
*  people and then they're all going to this island. You go there and you're like, look, Bill Clinton's [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4978.0199999999995s)]
*  here. This has got to be fine to be here. Look at all these incredible powerful people here. Oh, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4981.94s)]
*  I found a place where they all get together and where they can be protected and so you feel safe. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4986.5s)]
*  Then they have you. Wasn't everybody expecting some big names to come out of the documents? [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4993.219999999999s)]
*  They still haven't released all of them. What I understand is the list is only one [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=4999.94s)]
*  victim's encounters with people and she's relaying the list of the people. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5004.98s)]
*  The list of people that were at the island. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5010.740000000001s)]
*  That she interacted with and that she knows of and that she either had sex with or knows people that [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5012.740000000001s)]
*  had sex with and that knows that they were all filmed. Do you also think that he was killed? [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5018.58s)]
*  Yeah. That he didn't commit suicide? [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5026.18s)]
*  100%. Yeah. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5027.620000000001s)]
*  A lot of people do. Yeah. Well, Michael Baden, the famous [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5029.46s)]
*  forensic doctor that was in that HBO series Autopsy, did you ever see that show? It's a [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5033.38s)]
*  fascinating show that was on a while back that it was basically how this guy Michael Baden, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5038.9s)]
*  who's this brilliant forensic specialist, would examine these bodies and find evidence of them [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5046.099999999999s)]
*  being murdered. When they'd said they'd fell down a flight of stairs or this or that. When he examined [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5053.379999999999s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein's neck, he said that the injuries were indicative of someone being strangled, [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5058.98s)]
*  ligature strangulation, not hanging. Then it was at the base of his neck, which is not where you [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5066.9800000000005s)]
*  get strangled if you hang yourself. If you hang yourself, all your weight goes up here [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5072.02s)]
*  and you get strangled up near where your jawline is. But this was down at the base of his neck, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5077.14s)]
*  indicating someone strangled him from behind and his bones in his neck were fractured, [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5081.780000000001s)]
*  which is also indicative of someone who's strangled to death, not being hung. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5087.54s)]
*  Why was this made public or was it? [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5093.14s)]
*  His findings were made public. This is without doubt a bunch of incredibly powerful people [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5096.34s)]
*  who are using their influence to make sure that this information doesn't get out or that the [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5102.82s)]
*  impact of this information getting out is very minimal and that it just gets swept under the rug [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5107.94s)]
*  and every time more information comes out, there's a brief little burst of outrage, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5113.62s)]
*  but no one goes to jail, no one gets caught. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5118.82s)]
*  Galeen Maxwell is in jail for sex trafficking, but to who? To who? You have to sex traffic to [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5121.3s)]
*  someone to be arrested for sex trafficking and when there's no one that's being listed as the [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5129.78s)]
*  people that you sex trafficked, but the implication is that these people who you're sex trafficking to [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5136.0199999999995s)]
*  are the most powerful people in the world, that these powerful influential people are the ones [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5144.58s)]
*  that were the ones that were using this, the ones that were there, the ones that were victimized by [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5150.82s)]
*  the scheme or I don't want to say victimized, they were caught by the scheme. None of them are [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5154.5s)]
*  arrested, none of them are going to jail. But wasn't she trafficking girls for Jeffrey Epstein? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5161.22s)]
*  Wasn't that the whole thing? She was trafficking girls for Jeffrey Epstein, but to who? To who? [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5165.22s)]
*  To him, no? Wasn't she recruiting girls to come and have sex? Who were the men? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5170.82s)]
*  Because if it's not just Jeffrey. It's not like Jeffrey Epstein is having sex with all of them. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5177.0599999999995s)]
*  It was a bunch of other people. So who are those people? And how come there's zero effort [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5181.62s)]
*  in the media to uncover this? Yeah, I don't know. It's kind of insane. It is insane. It's really [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5188.58s)]
*  insane and these- But there was a doc done about it, a documentary done, right? Mm-hmm, I believe so. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5194.9s)]
*  I remember seeing it. Yeah, but it just goes in and out of the news. The news cycle today is so weird. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5200.5s)]
*  Something comes in and comes out and it's gone. It's very bizarre. It's very, very, very bizarre. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5207.06s)]
*  But the findings of this expert didn't make it to the final report on how it got here? [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5213.38s)]
*  No, this was post the- Look, there was an official autopsy. The city hung himself. And then they [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5218.34s)]
*  brought in- the family brought in Dr. Michael Baden to examine it. I think it was Jeffrey Epstein's [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5224.900000000001s)]
*  brother brought him in. I forget who brought him in. But Dr. Michael Baden goes in there and he's [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5229.38s)]
*  like, no, this guy was killed. And nothing changed in the official report? They didn't change it? [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5234.5s)]
*  No, why would they do that? I mean, everything about it is so crazy. First of all, the cameras [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5239.22s)]
*  didn't work. How convenient. How convenient. And this guy is not being watched 24 hours a day. He's [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5244.26s)]
*  one of the most important witnesses. And he- the person- wasn't there something about the person [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5251.7s)]
*  supposed to be watching him had just gone to the bathroom or something? They were asleep or something. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5256.1s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know what happened, but those people kind of shut the fuck up and then that just [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5260.02s)]
*  just gets swept away. That's insane. Yeah. But the idea is that he was either, you know, intelligence [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5265.860000000001s)]
*  agency from America or Massad and that this was a long-term tactic to control people and to get [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5274.18s)]
*  influence over them. I mean, you take these men and most of these men that are in these positions [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5282.74s)]
*  of power, these politicians and heads of enormous corporations. And I mean, look, the guy who is the [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5286.82s)]
*  CEO of Victoria's Secrets donated a $60 million house to him in Manhattan. And there was another [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5293.139999999999s)]
*  guy who was a big CEO, one of giving him over a hundred million dollars. There was a bunch of [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5302.0199999999995s)]
*  people that gave him sizable chunks of money. Out of the kindness of their heart. And, you know, [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5306.66s)]
*  some of them had to step down from their corporations because there was insinuation they were attached to [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5313.3s)]
*  him. Like what happened? But no one's in jail. No one went to jail for it. That's so crazy. Yeah. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5317.22s)]
*  It's high-level sex extortion. Yeah. If that's the case. But I think that's what they've always done. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5322.42s)]
*  Look, if I was an intelligence agent and if I was the head of an intelligence agency, it was like, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5327.46s)]
*  well, how do you manipulate people? You got all these powerful people. How do we get them under [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5331.3s)]
*  our control? Like that is one of the best ways. Especially if you can get loose in their inhibitions, [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5335.7s)]
*  get them drunk, give them coke. And then, you know, all of a sudden some beautiful girls giving them [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5340.34s)]
*  a back massage. And, you know, you're told it's fine. Don't worry about it. Don't worry. Have a good [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5344.82s)]
*  time on the island. You're my guest. Okay. And then you're in some room and there's, you know, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5349.62s)]
*  cameras everywhere, you know, realize it. And then they go, we have to talk. I want to show you [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5354.42s)]
*  something. This doesn't have to get out, but, you know, we need something from you. Yeah. It is crazy [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5359.22s)]
*  that it's not a bigger thing. It's crazy. Yeah. It's crazy. It's also crazy that that is probably [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5364.18s)]
*  going on right now somewhere else. There's probably another version of that happening, whether it's in [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5369.860000000001s)]
*  other countries or with other sort of similar situations. Look, intelligence agencies have [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5375.3s)]
*  always infiltrated shady groups. And for a good reason, you know. I mean, like, this is my argument [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5382.26s)]
*  about what people are saying, you know, all these feds and instigated January 6th. I'm sure they did. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5387.860000000001s)]
*  But also you would want like legitimate good intelligence agents on the ground January 6th, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5393.22s)]
*  just so that things don't go south. So that you know what the fuck is happening. If you got a [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5399.7s)]
*  bunch of people that are like some crazy militia group and they're planning on detonating a nuclear [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5403.7s)]
*  bomb in the Capitol, the only way to find out is to have people on the ground. Right. But what happens [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5408.1s)]
*  is those people then have a vested interest in getting people to do things so that they can [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5413.22s)]
*  arrest them, which is like the Governor Whitmer case where the 14 people that kidnapped or were [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5418.74s)]
*  planning to kidnap 12 of them were FBI informants. And two of them were FBI agents. The one who was [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5425.62s)]
*  the fake demolition expert was going to blow up the bridge. And the other one who's the getaway [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5432.26s)]
*  driver, the federal agents, like it's all fake. The whole thing was fake. There was two dummies [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5435.94s)]
*  that were like, what are we doing? And those guys were the ones who wound up going to jail. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5441.0599999999995s)]
*  Do you think that they weren't actually planning? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5445.78s)]
*  It wasn't their idea. They were just dopes. They were just dopes. They were convinced by somebody. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5447.7s)]
*  They got roped into this thing. And the next thing you know, they're being talked into some crazy plan [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5452.82s)]
*  where they're kidnapping the governor and the guys who were doing they're like, we never thought it [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5459.22s)]
*  was really going to happen. Like they were just losers who all of a sudden they're a part of like [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5463.86s)]
*  some crazy rebellious organization that's supposed to do something that's going to, you know, we're [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5468.1s)]
*  going to stand up for against tyranny and we're going to arrest that bitch. And what they were [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5473.38s)]
*  really doing was being tricked by federal informants. I don't know enough about that [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5478.82s)]
*  case. But I would say the only thing I would say is that there is some responsibility on the, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5484.34s)]
*  I mean, they can be dummies, but that's not self-defense for not true being found guilty of [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5487.9400000000005s)]
*  doing that. That's true. But also there's a sizable percent of this population that has an IQ lower [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5492.26s)]
*  than 85. It's pretty big. I think it's, what is the number? What's the number of people? I know [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5499.38s)]
*  we've looked this up before, but it's pretty confusing. Like the number of people that are [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5507.54s)]
*  under 85 IQ is pretty high. And if you can get one of them and tell them that you're going to [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5511.9400000000005s)]
*  kidnap the governor, the next thing you know, they have nothing going on in your life. Your life is [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5518.42s)]
*  meaningless and all of a sudden it's exciting. And you think you're a part of a good group. Like [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5523.7s)]
*  we're doing the right thing. Because you're fucking dumb. You have an 85 IQ. You're incapable of [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5529.06s)]
*  seeing big pictures. You have a nine volt brain. And there's a lot of people out there like that. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5535.3s)]
*  A lot. And that's the problem with incentivizing people to arrest people. Like, well, you've got [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5541.46s)]
*  to get them to do something to arrest them. So you manipulate them. The same thing happened [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5548.9800000000005s)]
*  right after 9-11, right? All these people were contacted by undercover agents who pretended. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5552.26s)]
*  To be jihadists. Yeah. And said, let's join our plot to bomb da-da-da. And all these people said [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5560.1s)]
*  yes, but it wasn't their plan. And it was an incentive. There's a famous story in Dallas. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5565.54s)]
*  There was a 19-year-old kid who was, again, not very smart. And they convinced him, they radicalized [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5568.74s)]
*  him and convinced him. They gave him a bomb and gave him a cell phone to detonate the bomb [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5575.06s)]
*  and then arrested him. There was no real bomb. Cell phone didn't do shit. It didn't really activate [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5580.02s)]
*  the bomb. But that guy's in jail. And they talked him into the whole thing. They provided him with [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5584.660000000001s)]
*  the materials. They gave him the plan. I do wonder, is there something that we don't know? [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5589.06s)]
*  Is it possible that the, is it, I mean, what led them to that kid or to those people that were [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5593.22s)]
*  wanting to kidnap the governor? Like, is it, were there any pre-planning? Maybe they knew that they [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5598.660000000001s)]
*  were doing something and in order to catch them, they had to sort of give them a little bit of fuel. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5603.14s)]
*  Yeah, they were probably radical. They were probably online talking a lot of shit. And then [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5608.18s)]
*  someone contacted them and took it to the next level. But there's a lot of people that say [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5612.66s)]
*  things. They talk shit online. There's a lot of Death to America people out there that don't [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5617.94s)]
*  actually do anything. It is a difficult, I have to say, and I'm playing the devil's advocate here, [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5621.54s)]
*  but if you're law enforcement and you're constantly being accused of showing up after [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5627.78s)]
*  the crime happens, if you're trying to prevent crime, then that's what you do. You're monitoring [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5632.5s)]
*  chat groups and trying to figure out how you can stop this from happening. Absolutely. And I fully [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5636.66s)]
*  support that. The problem is law enforcement agents are just like everything else, just like [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5641.139999999999s)]
*  plumbers or mechanics. Some of them are really good and some of them are fucking terrible and [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5647.78s)]
*  some of them are corrupt and some of them are jaded. And at the end of the day, all they give [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5654.18s)]
*  a shit about is catching people and they have a career and their career is all about catching [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5659.3s)]
*  people. And so if you can trick people into doing something and then catch them, that counts as a [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5664.5s)]
*  catch. And so if there's not enough going on, you make something happen. Trying to climb the [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5668.98s)]
*  ladder over here, Marianna. I don't have time for fucking ethics and morals and these little finer [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5674.74s)]
*  details. This is all bullshit. I'm trying to arrest people. Yeah, they are like everybody else, but [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5682.18s)]
*  they should be held to a higher standard. Yes, they should. But it's like all their businesses. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5686.42s)]
*  It's just like the pharmaceutical drug business. Like we need pharmaceutical drugs. They help people. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5691.54s)]
*  They save lives. They enhance people's life. I fully support the creation of pharmaceutical [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5695.46s)]
*  drugs for the most part. The problem is you have the people that create them, which are these [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5703.3s)]
*  scientists that are working and doing these studies and tests to try to figure out drugs that are [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5708.1s)]
*  beneficial and help people. And then you get the money people. And the money people are not scientists. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5713.94s)]
*  They're just like, how can I make more? It's like the story of the Sackler family. How can I make more? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5718.82s)]
*  Absolutely. It's a profit, profit, profit. That's all. Let's twist this narrative into like this is what you're [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5724.58s)]
*  going to take and it's going to make you better. And you're going to keep taking it forever. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5730.58s)]
*  Yeah. It's an interesting conversation. I don't want to get into politics at all, but there is [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5734.74s)]
*  it's an interesting conversation about how much do we want the government to regulate more or less. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5742.259999999999s)]
*  It's all about regulation and so many of these. And for my investigations, a lot of what happens [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5748.5s)]
*  actually happens because of lack of regulation. We did an episode on body parts, not organs, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5754.42s)]
*  but this time it was actually body parts. So most people think that when you die, you have a say in [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5761.780000000001s)]
*  what happens to your body. You can be cremated, you can be buried, or you donate it to science. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5766.18s)]
*  But actually, the US is pretty much the wild west of the body parts business. And there's [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5771.22s)]
*  people who are selling, chopping up your body and selling them on the back from the back door [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5777.94s)]
*  without any of your knowledge, which is crazy. And a lot of it is legal. A lot of it is illegal [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5782.58s)]
*  and it's being done and people are being caught. There was a mother and daughter, [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5787.379999999999s)]
*  mother and daughter in Colorado who ran, who had a funeral home and they also had a donation center [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5792.099999999999s)]
*  on the side and they had people come in and say they wanted their loved ones to be cremated. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5797.379999999999s)]
*  And instead of cremating them, they were again chopping up body parts and selling them to [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5803.38s)]
*  biogenetics and scientific centers around the world. And they were caught, but they were actually [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5809.78s)]
*  not charged for chopping up bodies. They were charged for fraud because it is very complicated [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5816.5s)]
*  and there aren't enough laws in this country that regulate what happens to your body after you die. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5821.38s)]
*  I had heard of this story where this one family, their grandmother died and they found out that [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5826.5s)]
*  she was used as like a crash test dummy. Yeah. And they had no idea that that was going to happen, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5831.38s)]
*  but they had donated her body for science. Yeah, that is science. Right, it is. And [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5837.06s)]
*  having surgeons operate on your hip, practicing with a hip, all of that is science. But that's [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5842.66s)]
*  better, I think, because at least you're aware that you donated the body. In these cases, [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5849.46s)]
*  they thought they'd received ashes that contained their loved ones and instead there was like [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5853.9400000000005s)]
*  batteries, burnt batteries and other bodies mixed in. Oh, God. People would go, this is such a crazy [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5859.3s)]
*  story, people would go into this funeral home and as they're signing the paperwork for the cremation, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5864.900000000001s)]
*  they would hear a chainsaw in the back. Oh, God. For real. And it was the mother whose job it was [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5870.42s)]
*  to cut up the body parts. Oh my God, with a chainsaw, it's like a welder's goggle on. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5876.18s)]
*  Exactly. And complained that, and they would say that they were building something in the back, [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5882.900000000001s)]
*  but this lasted like months or years and there's a constantly building something in the back. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5887.54s)]
*  Oh my God, they're just racking up bodies. Instead, they're racking up bodies. Isn't it crazy? Holy shit. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5891.7s)]
*  It's so insane. But that all happens, a lot of this of the for-profit body trade because of lack [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5896.58s)]
*  of regulations. Oh my God. And there's not enough, there are not enough laws out there where the Wild [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5902.66s)]
*  West, every other country has these laws and we don't because it's all about money. How can we [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5907.22s)]
*  make money out of people's donating, people's wanting to donate? How much money is involved [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5911.38s)]
*  in donating bodies? Oh, a lot. We heard of skulls being sold for $5,000. We met with a funeral [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5916.900000000001s)]
*  director that brought us a pen like this and inside the pen there was a little human skull. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5923.38s)]
*  And he told us all about how it works, like how they were selling, again, instead of cremating [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5928.9800000000005s)]
*  the bodies, they were selling their parts. There was a skin wallet being sold online [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5935.94s)]
*  for $2,500. A tongue can go for a thousand dollars. A human tongue? A human tongue. This is part of [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5941.379999999999s)]
*  the oddities market where people like to have human parts. Also like have it in formaldehyde on their [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5947.54s)]
*  mantelpiece or something. Yeah, and make wallets out of skin. Tattooed skin goes for more money. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5952.82s)]
*  Wallets out of skin, really? Yeah. You could buy those in America? You can buy them online. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5958.74s)]
*  You can find them. Why do I want to look right now? I'm looking at a story. Before you even said it, [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5963.86s)]
*  I saw it. Now I'm seeing the context. On the video, I'm not even listening to the words, but this [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5970.42s)]
*  Harvard morgue manager. Yeah, that's true. That was a case. And then they're showing these oddities. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5976.74s)]
*  What is that? Is that a real body? Look, cats, creepy creations. No, I don't think so. No? I mean, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5981.46s)]
*  I think the skulls are definitely real, but a lot of it is like mixed with other things. Okay. But [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5986.98s)]
*  it's interesting. So the Facebook groups that we got access to were sort of secret. That's one of [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5991.38s)]
*  the guys we tried researching out to. The guy with the- Allegedly trafficking stolen human remains. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=5998.34s)]
*  Yep. And that's the Harvard Medical School. The person working at the morgue was selling some of [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6005.7s)]
*  their body parts and procuring, also buying from that other guy. Yeah. People are so creepy. So [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6012.02s)]
*  strange. And so these groups, you would see the tongues and wombs. There was one that had a uterus [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6020.66s)]
*  in a formaldehyde and they're being sold, but it's the secretive groups that you need somebody who's [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6027.0599999999995s)]
*  been accepted into the group. But we saw all the listings. Have you ever looked into the bodies [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6031.54s)]
*  exhibit? So that was made with prisoners from China, I heard, right? Yeah. If you Google the [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6036.98s)]
*  definition or the explanation of where the bodies come from, it's Chinese unclaimed bodies, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6045.3s)]
*  which may include political prisoners. That's what it says. It actually says that, which may [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6051.7s)]
*  include political prisoners. Right. But here's the problem. The process that they use to turn [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6057.62s)]
*  people into statues for the exhibit, it's called plastination. You must do it within 48 hours of [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6062.9800000000005s)]
*  death. But a Chinese unclaimed body is only unclaimed when it's been sitting there for 30 days. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6068.58s)]
*  Wow. So that means all those people got murdered. Oh my God. Not only that, one of the wildest [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6074.42s)]
*  stories was there was a mayor in a city in China that was having an affair with a local television [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6079.7s)]
*  anchor. The wife found out about it. The woman went missing. Her name was scrubbed off the internet. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6086.18s)]
*  Months later, a new exhibit was in the body's exhibit of a pregnant woman who is exactly the [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6095.46s)]
*  same size and exactly the same amount pregnant that was when she went, lady, when she went missing. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6102.5s)]
*  She was eight months pregnant when she went missing. And the woman who was the wife, [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6107.86s)]
*  who was married to the mayor who was having the affair was the manager of the plastination factory. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6112.82s)]
*  So she killed the lady that her husband was having an affair with allegedly, and then turned that [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6120.02s)]
*  lady and her eight month old fetus into a fucking statue, which is still on display. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6127.62s)]
*  No, it is not. Yes, it is. It's part of that exhibition. Yes, it's part of that exhibition. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6132.66s)]
*  And they've resisted all attempts to do DNA tests. No way. The woman is essentially scrubbed for the [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6136.98s)]
*  internet. The woman that was murdered, you can't find her. But the woman who was the wife who was [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6143.78s)]
*  accused of murdering the pregnant lady also got arrested for murdering an English businessman. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6152.34s)]
*  After that, so she poisoned this English businessman and then was tried. But in her place [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6157.62s)]
*  in the trial was another woman. So she hired someone. She probably went to some poor family, [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6164.58s)]
*  got their daughter and paid them, we'll give you X amount of money. Your daughter's going to stand [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6170.26s)]
*  trial for me. Like your buddy double. Didn't even look anything like her. But this woman's on the [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6174.66s)]
*  stand. She says she did it. That lady went to jail. No way. 100%. How do you know all this? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6179.3s)]
*  Because I went I did a deep dive in it. I have a bit in my act about the bodies exhibit. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6183.94s)]
*  It's fucking crazy because there's a shitload of these exhibits. Oh, there's a permanent one [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6189.38s)]
*  at the Luxor in Las Vegas that is almost definitely filled with murdered people. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6194.099999999999s)]
*  That is so great. And people pay money to go and look at it. It's science. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6199.139999999999s)]
*  It's science. You go there. It's science. Look, it's science. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6203.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. The placination is interesting because that's what these family members thought was [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6207.7s)]
*  happening to their loved ones bodies and they cut them up. Right. It's cut into there's a lot [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6211.54s)]
*  of versions of it. There's some where the muscles are completely stripped off the body and they're [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6216.18s)]
*  hovering above the body. So you have like the frame of the bones and then you see all the [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6221.06s)]
*  individual muscles that are removed and like elevated. And then you have other ones where [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6226.26s)]
*  the arm is sectioned into pieces. So an arm is stretched out like 10 feet long and it's like [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6231.3s)]
*  sections of it. They leave their genitals on, which is very strange. Like that one. Look at [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6237.38s)]
*  that one. The person's sectioned. I mean, this is like serial killer freak shit. And if you see [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6241.86s)]
*  like what they do, they remove all of the blood vessels and they have them on display. There's [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6247.78s)]
*  also like these bizarre erotic ones where they have people having sex. It's like super serial killer [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6255.78s)]
*  vibes that you get from this. Like, look how this person split down the middle. The heart is in the [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6263.54s)]
*  center. The head is on both sides. It's complete macabre serial killer. Look at that one down there. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6267.86s)]
*  Those are the people having sex. So there's people having sex, including like penises inserted into [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6273.459999999999s)]
*  vaginas, breast tissue still on. So it's indicative of a woman that you know that it's a woman. There's [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6279.78s)]
*  people wrestling. There's people playing basketball. It's very fucking strange. I've never been to one [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6284.82s)]
*  of these. I mean, I've heard all about them, but I didn't know there were people having sex. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6291.3s)]
*  Yeah, I've been to it three times. The reason why I looked into it is because my daughter asked me [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6294.5s)]
*  where they get the bodies from. Is that how it all started for you? Yeah, my daughter was 10. She was [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6298.26s)]
*  like, where do they get these bodies? And I was like, my first thought was why didn't I ask that [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6303.06s)]
*  question? And then I started doing a deep dive. I believe they pulled it from Australia because of [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6308.42s)]
*  concern. Is that what it says? Yeah, I think they pulled the exhibit from Australia. Yeah, call to [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6313.62s)]
*  shut real bodies exhibition over fears it uses executed prisoners organizers of Sydney exhibit [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6318.1s)]
*  deny human rights groups claims the bodies are from Chinese political prisoners. Yeah, I'm sure [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6323.780000000001s)]
*  you'd deny it. But there's bullet holes in some of them. So if they're not, who are they from? Like [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6328.26s)]
*  have the people that organized this or came up with this idea said who they come? Well, they've [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6332.660000000001s)]
*  done investigative journalists reports on this. And one of the things they did is they went to one of [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6335.860000000001s)]
*  the plastic nation factories. And you see on the ground, they have bodies laid out with with pillow [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6339.46s)]
*  covers over their heads with blood on them. So these people are tied up, they're executed, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6345.3s)]
*  there's a bullet hole in their head, and they're all laid out. And then the factories right there. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6350.5s)]
*  So they're taking these people because they have to do this within 48 hours of death. They take them, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6355.14s)]
*  they skin them, they put them in this this fluid. I don't know exactly what the process is. But [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6358.9800000000005s)]
*  essentially, they, they use this process to stop the body from decaying. And they're selling them, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6364.9800000000005s)]
*  they're making money out of it. Oh, yeah, they sell them. And then also they these exhibits [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6371.7s)]
*  generate a lot of money because they're fascinating. When I went in Los Angeles, there's a [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6376.66s)]
*  giant line. Just look at this. They keep their penis on this guy's holding his skin to the right. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6380.34s)]
*  It's so insane. It's so insane that that is science. Like that that's a guy that was executed, [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6386.0199999999995s)]
*  and they turned him into a statue. Yeah, and now people go and pay to how many of the look at that. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6393.22s)]
*  There's a bunch of these. So the key look, he's got his penis still on, but he's holding his skin. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6398.26s)]
*  It's fucking creepy. And how many of them are there worldwide? I think there's a ton of them. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6402.66s)]
*  Really? So hundreds and hundreds of different cities? Yeah, a bunch of different cities, [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6410.58s)]
*  probably thousands of bodies. I've never been to one. Yeah. Well, if you're in Vegas, go to the [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6415.54s)]
*  Luxor before they pull it for people realize it's a fucking murder exhibit. So Chinese murder exhibit. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6421.06s)]
*  Do you think they're going to realize and shut it down? No, they haven't fucking arrested anybody [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6427.86s)]
*  for Jeffrey Epstein's Island. They're not going to arrest anybody for this. They're prisoners. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6432.58s)]
*  They're already dead. What are you going to do? We're trying to make money over here. Shut the [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6436.179999999999s)]
*  fuck up. This has been on for what, 15 years or more? Forever. I don't remember the first time [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6438.259999999999s)]
*  I went to one, but it was in the 2000s. I remember it came to Los Angeles and me and my buddies went, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6443.62s)]
*  we were like, what the fuck? And we were really high. So we're really high walking around this [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6448.82s)]
*  exhibit. All these dead people like, this is fucking twisted because it doesn't, it's not just [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6454.26s)]
*  the anatomy. It'd be one thing if it was these bodies and they remove the skin and you see all [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6459.860000000001s)]
*  of the muscle doing all the different, it's fascinating, right? But it's weird what they're [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6466.66s)]
*  doing to these bodies. Like they're, they, you know, the guy holding his skin, the people's head [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6471.54s)]
*  split in half and the brain is floating in the air above it. Like, what are you doing? Right. Having [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6476.18s)]
*  sex. All of that. Yeah. Having sex. There's in the middle of sex, two dead people. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6480.66s)]
*  Fucking bizarre. Do you think they killed them first and then got the bodies to have sex and then [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6487.3s)]
*  cut them up and. Yeah. They probably, you know, stuck something in the penis to keep it erect and [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6492.26s)]
*  then put it inside the girl's body. And then, and then there's ones of women where they split them [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6497.0599999999995s)]
*  right down the middle. And so they split them through their vagina and they cut them in half [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6502.5s)]
*  and you see like the ovaries and the womb and you see all that. That is fucking crazy. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6506.9s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. But go find the pregnant woman one. Cause that's the most bizarre one. See if [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6512.74s)]
*  you can find the story. Cause the story of the pregnant woman is really horrible. And these were [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6517.86s)]
*  journalists that were able to track her back and figure out who she was. So this is the woman. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6523.54s)]
*  Oh my God. That's also so disturbing. That is the woman allegedly who was having the affair with the [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6528.259999999999s)]
*  man who is the mayor of this Chinese city. Oh, another one. Well, found another buddy who [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6535.54s)]
*  fucked up. It's like they're just killing people. They kill people and turn them into fucking statues [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6543.3s)]
*  and then put it in a museum and it's okay because it's at a museum. Right. And it's science. It's a [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6548.66s)]
*  science museum. This has to be legitimate. So because of this like appeal to authority that [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6554.66s)]
*  you get from being at a science museum, nobody questions it except Sydney, Australia is the only [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6559.22s)]
*  they're like, Hey, Mike, what the fuck? Why the fuck did you get this body, Mike? [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6564.74s)]
*  I don't know how this is okay, but I think this is the only link that exists. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6571.94s)]
*  So that's the woman. She was a TV news anchor rumored to have been a Bo Gilles mistress during [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6576.66s)]
*  his term as Dalyan mayor. Buxin speculates that her pregnant body may have been plastinated in a [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6584.26s)]
*  body world exhibit. Yeah, they obviously deny it. Of course they deny it. Hold on. Stop right there. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6590.98s)]
*  The skull shape and other features of the pregnant woman's body at the body world exhibit said to [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6597.7s)]
*  resemble those of Zhang. Also, the nearly mature fetus inside the pregnant woman suggests the woman [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6601.7s)]
*  had been the victim of an officially sanctioned execution. The bodies displayed by body works [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6607.62s)]
*  were prepared by Voss Hagen's plastination company and Dalyan. Some neat sins have suggested that [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6613.139999999999s)]
*  Bo himself may have approved the company's registration in 1999. While the mayor of Dalyan, [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6620.66s)]
*  all the bodies used for the exhibit are said to be from Dalyan. Gunther von Hagens, the company [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6625.86s)]
*  founder is rumored to have special connection with Bo. Now you have to see the guy who invented [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6630.66s)]
*  the body works exhibit because he's right out of a fucking Indiana Jones movie. He wears creepy hats. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6638.0199999999995s)]
*  He looks very bizarre. Yeah. See if you can see like some of the other images of me always wears [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6644.74s)]
*  that fucking creepy hat. Where is he from? Gunther von Hagens. I think he's from Austria, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6650.42s)]
*  German, German anatomist, anatomist and businessman. But he always wears that [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6656.26s)]
*  fucking creepy hat. He looks like the kind of guy who would be selling executed people on display. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6662.9s)]
*  That's him. I mean, he looks fucking creepy as shit. That fucking hat alone. That is not the kind [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6669.78s)]
*  of hat you want to wear. If you want to tell me you've got a legitimate business of selling [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6676.1s)]
*  dead people. He looks evil. Doesn't he? See if you find some other pictures of him because some [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6680.42s)]
*  pictures of them that are like ultra creepy. Has he been interviewed? Has anyone asked him about [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6685.46s)]
*  the body? He probably shuts the fuck up. He did say that he's donating his body when he dies. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6689.38s)]
*  He wants to be part of the exhibit. Yeah. He probably feels guilty. Yeah. I think some of them have come from [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6693.46s)]
*  Russian prisoners as well. It's not just Chinese prisoners, but some of them are from Russian [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6700.26s)]
*  prisoners. But I mean, probably none of them are actually people that, oh, we have this body. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6704.18s)]
*  What are we going to do with it? It's been sitting around for 30 days. You can't. It's [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6710.18s)]
*  literally not possible because it has to take place within 48 hours of death. Just the process [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6713.9400000000005s)]
*  alone would lead people to be very suspicious. What the fuck are you doing over here? Yeah. Zero [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6719.54s)]
*  consent. Yeah. But meanwhile, it's science. It's science. I mean, that's what I saw when I first saw [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6725.9400000000005s)]
*  the bodies exhibit. Like, oh, this is amazing. Von Hagens faces investigation over use of bodies [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6731.700000000001s)]
*  without consent. Gunther von Hagen is a pioneer of body plastination, the technique of preserving [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6737.06s)]
*  bodies using saturating them with polymer resin, who was criticized for his televised autopsy in [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6742.1s)]
*  London is under investigation in the former Soviet state of Kyrgyzstan and in Heidelberg, Germany. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6747.38s)]
*  He's accused of using bodies without permission and falsely carrying the title of professor. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6753.06s)]
*  Professor. Oh, I like that. Oh, great. He's a fake professor too. He's one of those. Creepy hat. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6756.820000000001s)]
*  From Heidelberg University, however, in both cases, he denies any illegal acts and accuses the other [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6761.14s)]
*  side of misinformation. Oh, the old misinformation term. He'd make for a great documentary subject. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6766.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he would. I wonder if you let you talk to him. After about 200 bodies of unexplained origin [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6773.219999999999s)]
*  were recently found in his institute. A Kyrgyz, how you say that? Kyrgyz. Kyrgyz member of the [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6777.7s)]
*  parliament. Avakhan Tashkentanbekho accused Professor Von Hagens of having illegally abducted [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6784.259999999999s)]
*  several hundred bodies from former Soviet prisoners, hospitals and psychiatric asylums. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6793.54s)]
*  Abducted. Yeah. How many bodies exhibits are there worldwide? I don't know. They're not all the same [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6798.98s)]
*  company or whatever. Of course. One company says they have nine with more coming. Right. Yeah, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6805.14s)]
*  there's a lot. I think there's more than a hundred. I think there's more than a hundred exhibits [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6811.46s)]
*  worldwide. I'm not sure about that, though. There's various companies. We could start one if we found [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6815.46s)]
*  some of their old bodies. Oh, JRE body works. But that's the thing. It might not be just Russian [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6821.46s)]
*  and Chinese. There might be American bodies. Oh, for sure. That's what they thought that their [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6828.820000000001s)]
*  family members, that their family members' bodies were ending up in placination companies. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6833.46s)]
*  It's crazy. Well, they can get it within 48 hours. Yeah. They just got to get you to sign papers [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6838.26s)]
*  within 48 hours of death. Yeah. I wonder if there's a placination. There has to be a [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6844.02s)]
*  placination company here as well, right? That does it in the U.S. I don't know. I don't know. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6847.78s)]
*  Fucking sketchy, though. So sketchy. The whole body parts, all of it was just sketchy as shit. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6853.78s)]
*  We went to a cemetery in the middle of the night, grave digging. Oh, yeah. And saw them picking out [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6861.7s)]
*  parts of a body. And it's just so. Whoa. Did you get creeped out? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6869.219999999999s)]
*  shit that you didn't think existed, but it does. Ghosts and shit. Not afraid of ghosts. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6875.06s)]
*  Not afraid of ghosts? I would be afraid of ghosts if I was at a cemetery digging up bodies. I mean, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6879.620000000001s)]
*  that's when they come. I wasn't the one digging, though. I know, but you're there. If you get caught. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6885.14s)]
*  It was a crazy scene. It's like middle of the night, totally pitch dark, and we're going in [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6891.38s)]
*  with the digger and his team. Did you investigate at all in organ harvesting? We did. Illegal organs. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6895.46s)]
*  They do that with prisoners, too, right? Yes, perhaps. The ones we found were telling us that [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6902.58s)]
*  they were doing it with immigrants, which is very sad. Immigrants that were trying to come [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6910.26s)]
*  during the journey to make it to the US. So the most desperate and vulnerable people. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6914.98s)]
*  And we spent time with the cartel in Colombia and then in Mexico. And they were saying, yeah, [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6920.1s)]
*  they're going out to even homeless camps with immigrants in all parts of Mexico. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6925.86s)]
*  It's very, very hard to prove that what they're saying is right. We interviewed a guy called the [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6932.74s)]
*  wrecker. He calls himself the wrecker. He works for this cartel, the Gulf cartel in Colombia. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6937.94s)]
*  And he basically told us the most horrific story. He's in charge of basically killing people and [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6944.98s)]
*  gathering all this stuff, the organs and all that, with a doctor that comes that they pay. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6950.5s)]
*  But it was one of those interviews that when he left, I was like, [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6955.78s)]
*  I'm not sure how much of this is actually true. And I talk about it on camera and talk about how [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6960.34s)]
*  it's so hard to verify. But then we went to Mexico and actually interviewed a doctor [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6965.7s)]
*  who was basically threatened by the cartel if he didn't do some of these operations. So he [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6971.46s)]
*  had no interest in lying to us and told us how this whole thing worked. And then we interviewed [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6977.46s)]
*  an American that went and got an organ in Mexico. And so this American, did he know that it came [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6982.9s)]
*  from a murdered immigrant? Yeah, I asked him that. And I mean, we don't, there's no way of [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6989.14s)]
*  verifying that it came from, but that it came from the black market. So we don't know where the [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6994.02s)]
*  source is. And he said, basically, you can judge me all you want, but if you were dying, or if your [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=6997.46s)]
*  son or daughter was dying and you knew that the only way you could get this organ was on the black [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7004.42s)]
*  market, wouldn't you do it? And it's a really good question. Yeah. I mean, right. Depends on who [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7008.18s)]
*  they're killing. Right. But he, he, yes, of course, if you know who's being died. Can I get a bad guy's [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7014.74s)]
*  liver? You know, you know what I mean? If you know someone's evil, if it's healthy or not. Yeah, [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7020.98s)]
*  right. Probably not. Yeah, it's horrible. But again, broken system. 17 Americans die every day [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7027.3s)]
*  waiting for an organ and system is broken. So people have to go and look in the black market. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7034.0199999999995s)]
*  And I think I do think that if you go, you know, most people don't probably think that this is [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7039.38s)]
*  coming from vulnerable, poor immigrants. They probably don't want to know. No. And there's [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7044.1s)]
*  plenty of people out there that are willing to sell their organs, you know, in places like India [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7048.740000000001s)]
*  and even Mexico. The organs that they can live without. But do you know when they do like a liver [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7053.3s)]
*  donation, like say if you needed a liver and you and I were the same blood type, they could take [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7059.780000000001s)]
*  half my liver and give it to you and my body would regenerate that liver to full size in six to eight [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7064.58s)]
*  weeks. No. Yeah. That's why I love to come to your shows. I'm here doing this reporting and I had [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7070.5s)]
*  no idea that was the case. Yeah. So wealth of knowledge about this. Livers are fascinating. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7075.3s)]
*  That is insane. You could donate part of your liver and I could save you with my liver and my [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7079.62s)]
*  liver would go back to full size in two months. I think why aren't we all donating half of our [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7084.82s)]
*  livers then? Well, it's not, you know, if by the time your liver's failing, there's a lot going on. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7088.82s)]
*  Like you're probably on the death's door anyway. You probably have a host of problems. It's usually [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7095.62s)]
*  other than, you know, obviously genetic issues and cancer and all sorts of other stuff. Like some [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7101.78s)]
*  people just, it's abuse. It's, you know, you're drinking. You know, I know a guy who died of liver [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7106.18s)]
*  failure. He died of liver failure from drinking. It's just drinking constantly. And he was on the [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7111.22s)]
*  wait list for a new liver? I don't think he was. Just died of liver failure. So have they tried [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7115.7s)]
*  that? They've actually given people half a liver? Oh yeah. That's a real thing. They do that. Yeah. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7121.38s)]
*  And your body regenerates. The liver is the only organ in the body that can replace loss or injured [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7126.5s)]
*  tissue, regenerate. Donor's liver will soon go back to normal size after surgery. The part that [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7129.9400000000005s)]
*  you receive as part of the new liver will also grow to normal size in a few weeks. So if you take [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7134.18s)]
*  half of my liver, I still have half. I'll have a full one in a few weeks. And so will you. Wow. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7139.06s)]
*  I had no idea. Yeah. It's incredible. It's pretty crazy. Liver is a pretty amazing organ. Yeah. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7144.1s)]
*  It's amazing. Yeah. Are you on the, are you on the donor's list? That's a good question. I think [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7149.459999999999s)]
*  when I signed up for my driver's license, I did that. Yeah. Yeah, I am too. And even with this [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7156.339999999999s)]
*  body parts episode, just knowing what happens. It does help. Look, a friend of mine has a heart [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7161.62s)]
*  from someone. He had a heart transplant. He had a heart attack and his heart was deteriorating and [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7168.339999999999s)]
*  they gave him, and he's still alive. He's got a heart of some other person. Right. Yeah. It's [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7174.34s)]
*  amazing. He thinks it's an Asian woman. That's like his feeling. Really? Yeah. And they don't, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7179.62s)]
*  they haven't told him? I don't think they'll tell you. No. I think if the donor wants the [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7185.14s)]
*  person that gets it to know, they can know. Right. I believe so. Cause I've seen stories of people [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7189.9400000000005s)]
*  reunite like a donor. Yeah. That's gotta be crazy. Like someone's carrying around your heart, [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7194.66s)]
*  your loved one's heart. That was a story I saw. Exactly. That the daughter had died and the mother [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7200.74s)]
*  wanted to meet the person whose heart. Well, that's, that's noble. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7206.74s)]
*  there's a place. I mean, I definitely am encouraged donation. Well, they're going to be able to [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7213.219999999999s)]
*  regenerate tissue independently in labs. They've already done that with skin skin cells where [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7216.58s)]
*  they've recreated bladders and they've recreated different organ parts. They're going to be able [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7222.26s)]
*  to do that and just swap you out for a new body. Like Mary, that's about time. Swap you out for a [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7228.82s)]
*  20 year old version yourself. That would be great. Your brain and stick it in a 20 year old body. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7234.42s)]
*  Wake up in the morning. Oh, nothing hurts. That was great. Yes, please. Yeah. Well, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7240.259999999999s)]
*  that's probably going to happen. That's probably in our future. Or an AI version of ourselves. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7246.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's more likely. Yeah, that's more likely. More likely it will be integrated with AI. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7252.0199999999995s)]
*  That's what I think. Yeah, I think that's definitely happening. Yeah. Yeah. Have you had [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7257.94s)]
*  people on this show talking about AI? Oh, yeah, quite a few. Yeah, quite a few. It's kind of a [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7262.74s)]
*  constant conversation because, you know, Sam Altman was on. Oh, right. I love Sam. Yes. Great. And [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7267.54s)]
*  then I had the, the gentleman from Tristan Harris and what was the other guy's name again? [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7273.62s)]
*  As well. Raskin. Aza Raskin. Yes, from the Social Dilemma. And they came on and they are [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7278.1s)]
*  extremely concerned about AI and the race to sentient AI and who controls it and what happens [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7286.42s)]
*  when it gets released and what it does. And it seems, and it also seems inevitable. It seems [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7295.22s)]
*  like it's just going to happen and China is involved in it and Russia is involved, the United [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7300.18s)]
*  States is involved in it. And who knows how many other countries are involved in this research as [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7304.1s)]
*  well. And they're getting really close. Yeah. It's how do you fight against progress, right? That's [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7307.3s)]
*  I think the hard thing. Right. I think it's happening. Yeah. I just think we, we are the [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7313.54s)]
*  last biological people. That's what I think. Yeah. I think we're the last. I think we're going to be [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7321.3s)]
*  integrated. While we're alive still? Yeah. Within our lifetime, I think there's going to be [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7328.1s)]
*  artificial people. Yeah. You know, that's one of the big speculations that people have about these [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7334.58s)]
*  aliens and that what we're seeing is an alternative dimension or an alternative timeline. And what [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7341.38s)]
*  these things are is us in the future. Oh yeah, exactly. That we are a creation of them and [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7348.58s)]
*  they're watching us and we are creation of something that was done in the future. And we become that. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7355.38s)]
*  Right. And the likelihood mathematically is much more likely, right? That we are that. Yeah. Right. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7359.62s)]
*  That we're sort of a video game for people in the future that are playing our characters. Or that [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7365.54s)]
*  we're some sort of a farm. Right. You know, this is how they, this is how they develop intelligent [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7371.14s)]
*  life. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Have you ever seen anything crazy when you're out in [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7377.78s)]
*  the sky? Have you ever seen anything weird in the sky or anything? Not in the sky. I see so much crazy [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7386.66s)]
*  shit right here. Right on the ground. I don't really need to be looking at the sky. What else have you, [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7391.38s)]
*  what else did you study this year? There's one, a really good one. It's an episode I'm really proud [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7396.66s)]
*  of. I mean all of them. But this one, it started with a DM, a direct message from a woman in Minnesota [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7403.94s)]
*  who told me that her father was in prison in Mozambique, Africa. And that she was absolutely [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7409.78s)]
*  sure he was not guilty. And it started a huge investigation into, Mozambique used to be Portuguese. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7415.3s)]
*  They speak Portuguese. I have friends that live in Mozambique. So immediately it piqued my curiosity. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7420.9800000000005s)]
*  Why is an older American guy stuck in prison and his daughter is desperate enough to contact me [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7425.14s)]
*  because she wants to try to figure out how to free her dad. And so we started investigation. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7431.14s)]
*  Turns out this guy was scammed, terrible scam. He was told he was a retired truck driver, [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7435.62s)]
*  former military. He was told that he had gotten, his wife had just died. He was told he had gotten [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7441.14s)]
*  an inheritance and that the inheritance was in Europe. His wife had connections to families in [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7445.780000000001s)]
*  Europe. So it was totally believable according to him. But in order to get the inheritance, [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7451.3s)]
*  he would have to do a pit stop in Africa. But they would pay for everything. His flights, [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7456.26s)]
*  his hotels, everything. So it was a free ride to go to Africa, pick up the documents and then take [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7460.740000000001s)]
*  them to Europe. And in the bag with the documents were some chocolates that he was to take to Europe [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7466.34s)]
*  to the people he was meeting. And as he's in the airport about to board his flight to Europe, [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7472.42s)]
*  he was stopped by the authorities and he was carrying five kilos of heroin inside these [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7478.18s)]
*  chocolates that he was completely unaware. And I completely believe he had no idea. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7483.14s)]
*  So he's sent to prison. He's given one day trial, 17 year sentence. He's almost 70 years old. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7488.5s)]
*  So he's probably going to die in prison. And it turns out he wasn't the only American there. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7495.3s)]
*  There was another American from California and a Canadian, all victims of the same scam. And [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7499.860000000001s)]
*  within two, three days, all three of them. And this is one, just one high security prison in Mozambique [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7504.9800000000005s)]
*  out of all prisons around the world. So we went, we visited him, we saw him, we brought his daughter [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7510.58s)]
*  to see him. She hadn't seen him in four years. Super emotional. And then we went to South Africa. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7514.74s)]
*  We basically investigated the trail of money and who had paid for what, the hotel, the flights, [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7519.78s)]
*  everything. And we came face to face with one of his cameras. We filmed undercover in a hotel in [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7525.78s)]
*  South Africa where I basically confronted this guy who's camped him. I pretended that I was a friend [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7531.62s)]
*  and I was looking for that inheritance as well. And that I had, you know, that I was willing to [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7538.099999999999s)]
*  travel and do whatever for that money. I pretended I was a, what they call a MAGA, which is a [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7543.38s)]
*  dumb, gullible American. They call them MAGAs. Like make American great again? Yeah. It's [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7549.62s)]
*  interestingly the same name, but I don't think it comes from. It's a Nigerian, it's a Nigerian [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7555.299999999999s)]
*  saying for a gullible person. I don't think it's new. So it predates MAGA? I think so. Wow. It's [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7559.86s)]
*  interestingly the same. Yeah. That's the first thing I thought when I saw it as well, when they [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7566.9s)]
*  said it to me, but I pretended I was a MAGA. And then yeah, came face to face with this guy. It's [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7570.179999999999s)]
*  crazy. What was that like? It was interesting because at first we sat down and he was, I was [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7577.14s)]
*  saying that, you know, that the Rodney Baldus, which is this man's name, the Rodney Baldus name, [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7582.9800000000005s)]
*  and do you have his inheritance? And I said, I think it's $2.7 million and is that money still [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7587.14s)]
*  available? And he was like, actually it's 2.4, 2.5. I was like, okay. So he's corroborating [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7592.660000000001s)]
*  what I'm saying. So I started talking with him a little bit more, but then he got a little [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7599.46s)]
*  suspicious and he was asking to see my ID. He said, okay, great. But in order to be able [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7603.86s)]
*  to continue talking to you, I have to see your ID. I couldn't show him my ID because I hadn't [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7608.74s)]
*  given him my real name, obviously. So at that point I decided to get to leave, pretend I was [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7612.179999999999s)]
*  going to my room to get my ID. And then I came back and decided to confront him and tell him, [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7617.38s)]
*  look, I'm a journalist. I'd really like to talk to you on camera. And he was like, pretended that he [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7620.9s)]
*  had no idea what I was talking about, that he had called me Zoe. And then he was like, no, no, no, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7626.82s)]
*  I'm here to meet, what's your name? Catherine. I was like, wait, aren't you Mr. Wilson, the man [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7632.9s)]
*  that I just spoke to? And he was like, no, no, no, I'm not Mr. Wilson. My name is Robert or whatever. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7638.0199999999995s)]
*  I was like, dude, I have you on camera. I'm filming. He's like, we're doing what? I'm filming. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7643.299999999999s)]
*  I filmed this whole interaction. And then he stands up and left. And it was a whole thing [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7648.339999999999s)]
*  because he's part of this bigger group that is a criminal group and kind of scary and dangerous. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7653.379999999999s)]
*  But we presented this. We reached out to the State Department to see if they could investigate [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7659.46s)]
*  because they have done very little for Rodney and if they could investigate his case and crickets. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7665.3s)]
*  Nothing. They didn't refuse to talk to us. They say they're doing that what they can [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7672.42s)]
*  to help him, but he's in completely substandard conditions in this prison with no real access to [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7676.1s)]
*  good health care. And the guy's going to die in prison. And there's no way to get him out. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7682.82s)]
*  That's what we're trying. I hope that when this doc is aired, it's not on Hulu yet. It will be on [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7689.14s)]
*  Hulu and it will be on Niger soon. But when it airs, the government will take another look and try [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7695.78s)]
*  to do something for this guy. It's like former military guy. It's so obvious that he's innocent. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7700.9800000000005s)]
*  And they're not even trying. That's what upset us is that there isn't real help there in getting him [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7706.26s)]
*  his medication. His food has to be paid, has to be brought from the outside because they don't give [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7714.26s)]
*  him actual food in prison. So his daughter has to send money via me to a friend of mine who lives [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7720.0199999999995s)]
*  in Mozambique. So it's this whole bank exchange in order to provide food for this guy in prison. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7726.42s)]
*  They give you like a really bad porridge once a day or something like that. Not something that's [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7732.26s)]
*  any good for your health. And he has diabetes and has a bunch of other. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7736.74s)]
*  So they hire this woman to cook food and bring him to prison every day. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7741.06s)]
*  What a way to end your life. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7748.02s)]
*  It's so crazy, right? [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7750.5s)]
*  Scammed like that. Just uses a drug mule. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7751.46s)]
*  And abandoned by your government. No one's doing anything. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7753.9400000000005s)]
*  At least that's my... Yeah. And realizing that this is actually big and is happening all around. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7758.900000000001s)]
*  How do you maintain your faith in humanity? [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7765.06s)]
*  I do. I know you do. You're a very friendly, nice, smiling person. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7772.34s)]
*  I'm very, very optimistic. Very optimistic about the world. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7778.42s)]
*  Which is crazy considering what you've seen. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7780.5s)]
*  But it's not because when you're able to sit down with a cartel member [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7782.900000000001s)]
*  or a scammer in the Philippines or all these people that I meet around the world [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7788.1s)]
*  and I'm able to find humanity in them. I'm able to find commonalities between me and him. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7792.26s)]
*  I'm able to see that if this person in the majority of cases was given another [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7797.94s)]
*  opportunities that he wouldn't be the person he turned out to be. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7802.74s)]
*  That shows me that it's not entirely humanity that's broken. It's the system. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7806.18s)]
*  It's the systems that we've human beings have created. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7811.3s)]
*  But the accountability at the end of the day lies in the people of power. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7814.42s)]
*  The people that are able to make a difference in that system. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7817.94s)]
*  Not in the drug dealers or the coyotes, smugglers or the scammers. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7821.54s)]
*  It's amazing that you can maintain that perspective. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7827.06s)]
*  And that just really is an amazing testament to your character. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7829.46s)]
*  That you're able to see that for what it is and not lose faith in people. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7833.46s)]
*  Because you are confronted constantly with these scenarios. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7838.74s)]
*  But that is the one thing they have in common is desperate people. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7842.9s)]
*  Absolutely. It's always the most vulnerable people. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7846.18s)]
*  Nobody is born wanting to be a criminal. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7848.82s)]
*  You are put in that position. And that's what I see again and again. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7851.3s)]
*  Listen, Mariana, what you do is amazing. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7856.42s)]
*  I'm stunned by your courage. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7859.860000000001s)]
*  You're one of the real last boots on the ground journalists who goes into terrifying places. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7863.62s)]
*  And consistently exposes these incredibly fascinating, horrific scenes. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7870.1s)]
*  If it wasn't for you, a lot of people wouldn't know about a lot of these things. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7878.1s)]
*  So thank you. Thank you for everything you do. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS35NFFFg6k&t=7881.62s)]
