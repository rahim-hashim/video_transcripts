# Joe Rogan Experience #2012 - Gad Saad
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6.0s)]
*  I already saw it. Oh my god, I'm excited to see you. Good to see you, it's always great to see you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10.0s)]
*  I think this is the ninth time I appear, so am I entering kind of Hall of Fame style? Yeah, there's like after five, anybody with more than five. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=16.0s)]
*  That should be like the top line on my CV. Forget about all the other bullshit. Nine times on Joe Rogan. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=26.0s)]
*  We've had some fun conversations. Yeah, before we start, today, July 25th, is the release of my latest book. Here's a copy for you, sir. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=32.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. The Sad Truth About Happiness, Eight Secrets for Leading the Good Life. Boom. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=40.0s)]
*  Alright. Please read it. I will. You'll enjoy it. Did you do the audiobook? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=47.0s)]
*  I swear to god, the number one thing I was worried that you were going to ask me was that. And you lead off with that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=51.0s)]
*  So here's what happened. An actor does it. So he has a beautiful voice. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=58.0s)]
*  I insisted, I said, Joe Rogan berated me on his show for maybe 15 minutes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=63.0s)]
*  Listened to him. They pitched it to the audio publisher. The audio publisher said, sorry, we do in-house narration. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=71.0s)]
*  So I think for the next book, I'll put it as part of the contract. Yeah, it has to be. They're silly. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=78.0s)]
*  They're silly, especially in you're a public figure. Like there's hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of you talking. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=84.0s)]
*  Indeed. Now, when people want to hear your words, they want to hear them through your mouth. And it's personal stories. Yes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=91.0s)]
*  It makes no sense. I'm sold. Believe me, I fought the fight. I know. But it's such a it's such a silly fight to have when someone's a professional [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=98.0s)]
*  public speaker like yourself. Like doesn't make any sense with a very velvety voice, velvety, smooth. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=107.0s)]
*  And, you know, who's closer to the subject matter? Right. Indeed. Come on. I know the truth behind the words. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=116.0s)]
*  Like you're going to say these things if you're talking about especially like real life experiences, you're saying them as you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=122.0s)]
*  I lead off, by the way, in first chapter to talk about sort of existential happiness, about how I came very close to being aborted in Lebanon. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=128.0s)]
*  I don't want somebody else to be telling that story. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Of course. Your story is wild. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=138.0s)]
*  You know, when I find about people like yourself that have been through like like a really scary thing, really scary, like genuinely scary, like scary threats for threats of your life. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=145.0s)]
*  War zone stuff. Folks like yourself have so much less patience for nonsense. Exactly. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=160.0s)]
*  And that's why I sometimes can appear irascible. Yeah. When I go after because sometimes people will say, you know, when I meet you, you seem so much nicer and warmer than how you are on social media. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=167.0s)]
*  But I'm not trying to be mean on social media is that I'm pissed off at the bullshit. And so it comes across as though, you know, I'm cantankerous and combative, but I'm just really fighting. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=179.0s)]
*  Hopefully the good fight. The real problem with social media is the problem with human beings. It's tribal group think. Yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=189.0s)]
*  And it overwhelms these groups of people that you associate with. And then narratives get formed and you can't stray outside those narratives. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=195.0s)]
*  You can't even look at objective reality. You can't look at data. You can't look at it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=205.0s)]
*  It just becomes so crazy. The ideology and the adherence that ideology trumps everything trumps the truth. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=210.0s)]
*  It trumps your willing as long as the politicians on your side to ignore craziness, corruption, horrible shit. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=216.0s)]
*  You ignore all of it. Perfect example of that. I hate to say that I've seen his feed meathead from all in the family. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=225.0s)]
*  Rob Reiner, have you ever gone to his? I've read a couple of tweets and I'm like, I'm out. I love his work too much. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=234.0s)]
*  I know. I know. It's hard to then like his work when he is so overwhelmingly obsessed with with Trump. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=242.0s)]
*  Stephen King is another guy who fits that description. Something happens to old liberals with a ton of money. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=251.0s)]
*  It's like something happens to those old creative types. Yeah. It just, you know, it doesn't make sense. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=261.0s)]
*  It doesn't make sense that you're arguing with people online about it all day long. If you're Rob Reiner or if you're Stephen King, like putting nasty tweets out. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=268.0s)]
*  So I actually I wrote maybe it was shameless plugging of my book, but I responded to Rob Reiner. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=278.0s)]
*  I said, let me send you a copy of my book. Man, there's so much that you have to be happy about. Stop being mired endlessly in vitriol. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=285.0s)]
*  I mean, that's all he does. I mean, imagine this guy, how many things he's got to be grateful about. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=294.0s)]
*  He's a creative guy, a talented guy, and he spends all day obsessing on issues that ultimately he's got no control over. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=299.0s)]
*  Well, people viewed Trump as an existential threat to the the very fundamentals of the country. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=306.0s)]
*  They thought that he was going to come in and he was going to represent corruption on a level that we've never seen before. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=314.0s)]
*  But the problem with doing that and saying that is that it opens the door to examining all the other corruption. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=322.0s)]
*  Like, how much corruption is there? Yeah. Like, how much? What do you? How much money you guys making? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=329.0s)]
*  Where is this money coming from? There's so much corruption that's readily available that once you start opening the door to calling someone a monster, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=334.0s)]
*  then everyone gets to look at you and go, hey, but what about you guys? Like, what are you doing? What about what about drone bombings? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=342.0s)]
*  Let's talk about some real problems. So what about the fentanyl crisis? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=349.0s)]
*  Like, what about you know, what about the the borders where like criminals are coming through? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=353.0s)]
*  Like, how many are being sent back? What's the numbers? Yeah. What's the numbers? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=358.0s)]
*  I mean, a lot of them are good people that just want to find a better way to live and good for them. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=362.0s)]
*  And I would do it. I would do it, too. If I could sneak across into America and be assimilated, I would fucking do it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=366.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't you? If you've got a bad roll of the dice and you're living in somewhere that's less favorable and you get the opportunity to just all you have to do is get across the river and they let you in. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=372.0s)]
*  But how many of those people shouldn't be here? How many of those people are dangerous? How many? What's the number? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=381.0s)]
*  It's not zero. What's the number? Well, I could tell you that we've talked about in the past when we talked about people who come from certain cultures where there is rampant anti-Semitism. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=386.0s)]
*  Yes. And so if you let people that are coming from cultures where when they're polled somewhere between 90 to 99 percent of them will exhibit rampant Jew hatred, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=396.0s)]
*  it doesn't take much of a sociologist or survey analyst to recognize that out of all those people that are coming in, you're going to have an increase of Jew hatred. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=408.0s)]
*  Yesterday, I was out with some friends here in Austin. And so one of them asked me, have you seen an uptake on Jew hatred? Are you exposed to more? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=418.0s)]
*  I say it's endless. I mean, it's usually on social media. Do you think it's ramped up or do you think now that Elon has taken over Twitter and allowed much more free speech? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=427.0s)]
*  Hard for me to tell. I really don't know. But there is kind of a normalized. Now, many of them are behind anonymous accounts. Of course. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=438.0s)]
*  But there is kind of a cavalier normalization of just say. So, for example, I think someone had retweeted, you know, a promotional thing about my book. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=446.0s)]
*  And someone said, you know, why are you promoting the Jew? Like, my God, this this guy could be your your son's teacher. He could be the grocer at the store. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=456.0s)]
*  You know what? I have a real concern with that. And I also have a real concern with vested entities like organizations that would want people to be at each other's throats, stirring up things with fake social media posts, because this is a real problem that's happening in the world right now. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=467.0s)]
*  Right. You know, someone tweeted a bunch of different examples of where dozens and dozens of accounts are saying the same inflammatory things with the exact same wordage. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=485.0s)]
*  Exact. And they're all like, you know, they have numbers and letters and their accounts like just random accounts. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=499.0s)]
*  And, you know, you go to their page, it looks kind of real. They have a photo. There's like them with a flag. It's like and you go through it. But you get this sense like, oh, you're you're a bot. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=505.0s)]
*  Like, you're not even a real person. Like, so you you're an agent of your stirring up bullshit. So there's a certain aspect of our culture. I don't know what the percentage is, but there's a certain aspect of the conversations online that are being flavored by fake accounts that are designed to be fake. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=515.0s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to get people upset with each other. Yeah. It's like psychological warfare on a level that no one anticipated and no one's prepared for. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=535.0s)]
*  Because when you have the two things we already discussed, like this adherence to the ideology, no matter what, no matter what, like there's no you can't objectively logically defend any of the things that are in opposition of it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=547.0s)]
*  So you have this. So are you I noticed, I mean, obviously we follow each other on Twitter. You almost never I mean, short of the recent thing you did with Peter Hotez, you almost never weigh in on anything is has was that sort of a conscious thing for you to step back. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=562.0s)]
*  That one it was like, OK, this is crazy. You're you're you're you're saying that he was he made some crazy tweet about neo fascist. Yeah, yeah, I saw that. Like, what are you talking about? Like with Robert Kennedy, Jr. With me. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=578.0s)]
*  I'm like, this is dangerous. Like what you're saying is totally untrue. You know, it's untrue and you're willing to just say it because like the more you can discredit someone who is in opposition to some of your ideas, the more you can somehow another in your weird game of checkers. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=592.0s)]
*  You're playing like elevate yourself. You don't think people know what you're doing. Like that's like the most clear. Neofascist. Like what the fuck are you saying? Did you feel more angry at the fact that you had already had a conversation with him? And so you there was some kind of personal connection between you two. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=609.0s)]
*  I mean, I can say he's not your sure I've had him on at least. Was he on twice? Twice. I've had him on twice. I was very nice to him. Yeah. Even in disagreement with him, like in issues of health. I was very nice to him. But you can't just say stuff like that. And, you know, it's like I just wanted to say, like, have a debate with the guy. Yeah. Like, have a debate with the guy. So what ended up happening? I think it got up to like two million dollars. He's not going to do it. I don't do it. You know, I don't think he wants to do it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=626.0s)]
*  You know, and there's the idea that like Robert Kennedy would be too silver tongued like stock. Come on, because he's a lawyer. You know, he's really good arguing stuff. Like if you either have facts or you don't have facts. Right. And if you're scared to debate the facts, I have to go. What are these facts? What's bothering you? What do you worry that he might bring up? I mean, what are we saying? It could be the case. So, for example, I've been often asked, why don't you debate creationists evolution? And I take the position there of Richard Dawkins, which is it's not that I'm too hardy to say. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=656.0s)]
*  I'm not too hardy to debate anyone is that there's almost no chance that I could present any evidence that would cause you to alter your position. Yeah. So it's really a losing proposition. So could it be that Peter Hotez is coming from that perspective? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=686.0s)]
*  It could. But you know what I would say to that? Even in your case, it is preposterous for someone to not believe that at least there's a process of evolution at this stage. It's kind of crazy because there's like there's evidence of things that are happening where things are adapting to their environment right now that we've tracked. Yeah, exactly. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=700.0s)]
*  Like, you know, there's a little antelope in the Congo that swims underwater and eats fish. Is that right? Yeah, it's called a diker. I think it's called a diker. D I K E R. I think that's how you say it. But this little animal evolved, lived on grasslands and the grasslands became rainforest. And when the grasslands, these little like prairie animals were trapped inside the Congo. There's an amazing BBC documentary about it. But they've got like these things are evolving. Yeah, like they're figuring out a swim. But believe me, how do you know that? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=721.0s)]
*  Having spent 30 years trying to convince some of my academic colleagues about the value of evolution and studying human behavior, they'll go la la la. Right, right. With human behavior. Yeah. And especially with, you know, certain narratives. So this one is just swimming in the water. But these motherfuckers can go underwater. They can. The dikers that they were talking about in the Congo, they can swim under water for like 100 yards. Why do I feel that the crocodile is about to hit it any second now? Because we've seen too many of those videos. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=751.0s)]
*  That is arguably one of the scariest scenarios. The scariest, the fucking scariest. I have to pause. Something happened with my video right now. Oh, it's some doing sense mixing your two things really strangely. Do we got a reboot? Not a reboot. I just got to figure out what happened. Okay. But we got everything else. No, yeah, it's so it's just yeah, when I cut to your camera, it's blending them together. So the people only listening to audio, this special segment of the podcast, it's only just for you. There you go. Because the videos [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=781.0s)]
*  fucked. Should we stop talking? I mean, you can keep talking. It's just that the video looks weird. So I don't want to be a distraction. All right. Well, let's fix it. We'll pause. We'll be right back. We're back. All right. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=811.0s)]
*  Technical difficulties. I just want to close the parentheses on something that happened from last show. Oh, incredible story. You ready? Yeah. That's actually speaks about connecting with people. So last show you had asked me or not yet asked me we were talking about who would be some guest that we'd really want to have on our [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=822.28s)]
*  respective shows. And you probably don't remember what my two celebrities were. Do you? I don't remember. Clint Eastwood. And first, I appreciate his politics. I've been watching him since I was a kid in Lebanon. Number two was Bert Bacharach, who's do you remember who that is? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=839.04s)]
*  Remember the name? Bert Bacharach is the music composer who's basically written songs for everybody. He was featured in one of the Austin Powers movie where he the guy says, ladies and gentlemen, Bert Bacharach, you know, anyways, after our chat aired, I go on my Instagram, I have a personal DM, private DM from what looks like the account of Bert [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=857.08s)]
*  Bacharach, who's, you know, arguably the biggest musical, you know, composer in the United States. So I'm extremely excited. It turns out it was his son who said, Oh, your your clip with Joe Rogan was passed on to me. And I think I would be great for I'd love for my dad to come on your show. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=886.76s)]
*  And now cut to the punchline, it never ended up happening. He recently passed away. So perhaps he wasn't I mean, he was like 9495. But just the fact that you and I are having a conversation, someone else picks it up. And then my word can my world can intersect with Bert Bacharach, whom there is no conceivable place where his word and world and mine would ever connect. That's the beauty of life. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=909.24s)]
*  Wow, that is the beauty of life. That's awesome. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=935.56s)]
*  Is that amazing? Yeah, you are a connector, sir. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=938.4399999999999s)]
*  I try to be Clint Eastwood be an interesting guy to talk to. Like, the guy still works. It's like 93 years old. Still out there making movies. Yeah, well, I don't enjoy it. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=940.88s)]
*  I remember in Lebanon when I only learned English and when I moved to Canada when I was 11. And I got all the communication I needed to get even though there wasn't much dialogue in the spaghetti westerns. I would look at him and I would say, that's that's the man, you know, and so he's [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=950.64s)]
*  remember every which way but loose. Of course he hung around with an orangutan. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=969.0s)]
*  So that's a bit later, right? That's a fucking movie. That's in the 70s. Right? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=974.1999999999999s)]
*  I believe so. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I believe it was the 70s. Yeah, yeah. He played a bare knuckle boxer. That's right. Who traveled around with an orangutan. That's right. I think that sounds like 77. But I'm talking in the 60s. I'm talking, you know, 65, 67, 68 when I'm, you know, four or five years old. And I'm watching this guy and in Lebanon. Wow. That's the power of, you know, the male archetypes. That is still every which way, but loose, right? I'm not conflating two movies, right? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=978.36s)]
*  That's the movie where he was the bare knuckle boxer, isn't it? I think that sounds right. Yeah. Yeah. And I think at the time, his love interest in that movie. The hell was that? What was that? Jesus, Jamie. You got a wrong tab open up. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1007.76s)]
*  I started the trailer. How dare you? How about taking in a new movie? OK, which I guess is what this trailer is. And I don't know why there's nothing on it. Oh, you can't see the video. I don't know. Oh, what is happening? OK. Yeah, but it's weird. Oh, there's that's the one. I guess so. I don't know what that is over it. It seems like someone was. Oh, I said 77 at 78. There you go. Yeah. Yeah. Is this a dumb ass movie? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1021.52s)]
*  Those movies are great, though. I love movies from that era. Like, ridiculous like like Smokey and the Bandit. Yeah. I mean, come on, man. Jackie Gleason. You got Burt Reynolds, Sally Fields. Come on. That's a fun movie. Yeah. Jackie Gleason plays a cop. It's hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what's your favorite movie of all time? If you had to pick one? I really don't think I have one. But you know, when I watched recently, I rewatched it. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1048.0s)]
*  I watched is 2001 Space Odyssey. I forgot how good that was. That movie is amazing. It's not just amazing. It's amazing visually. And it's from 1968. Yeah, it's amazing. The special effects are so good. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1078.0s)]
*  Like all through it, like even the apes in the beginning, you know, the scene where they're evolving. Yeah. When they encounter the monolith, the fucking special effects on the apes is pretty goddamn good for 1968. My all time favorite, the original 12 Angry Men. I first saw and actually it speaks to what we talked about earlier about how you can get someone to change their mind when they're in a tribal mindset. Because I watched the movie for the first time in a first semester. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emcee. I was an emce [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1094.0s)]
*  I was an MBA student and I was taking a organizational behavior class where the professor assigned us that movie to watch it to demonstrate group dynamics because for those of you who don't have you seen it? Joe, I don't think I have or you need to rent it tonight. So basically, it's a Henry Fonda. That's it. That's the one. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1124.0s)]
*  Okay, I think I have but it was a long long time ago. So let me tell you the premise [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1145.26s)]
*  12 guys get together in a room. They're trying to discuss whether a guy should be put to death, you know found guilty [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1150.58s)]
*  They take us a poll [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1157.9s)]
*  Eleven say he's absolutely guilty. Let's go home one guy Henry Fonda says hey [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1160.06s)]
*  Let's let's sit and talk about it [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1165.18s)]
*  The rest of the movie is how he gets each of the 11 other guys to flip their positions [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1166.86s)]
*  And so that's why I had watched it in that MBA course because it demonstrates how you know [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1173.1s)]
*  There are techniques you can use to try to persuade people. Of course today you could almost never do it [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1177.78s)]
*  I can never convince Rob Reiner of anything, but you know, I mean I wouldn't necessarily say that [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1182.3s)]
*  I think some people are just like really deeply cemented in their belief systems [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1188.34s)]
*  And I mean, maybe they can relax [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1192.46s)]
*  It's still it's still part of your human being if you're a human being and you're willing to look at objective truth [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1195.34s)]
*  You can realize that like there's some other things afoot. There's like there's a tribal aspect to all of our ideological [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1200.62s)]
*  problems that makes objective reasoning a [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1208.5s)]
*  Giant problem. It is like it gets in the way of everything [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1212.6999999999998s)]
*  Because people are so tribally committed right now and that they're tribally committed to this idea that the other side is the end [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1216.4199999999998s)]
*  Of the world if they take power [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1223.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and there's all these different things that are bounced back around these [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1225.4599999999998s)]
*  Societal issues that keep getting bounced back around or you like what? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1231.02s)]
*  Why aren't these resolved like the Roe v. Wade one and now they're talking about? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1235.54s)]
*  gay marriage like doing the same thing with gay marriage like [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1240.9399999999998s)]
*  Why do you want to do this? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1244.4199999999998s)]
*  Are you doing this because you just want people to squabble about shit because that's what it seems like because that's the only reason [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1246.06s)]
*  why you would have like [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1251.2199999999998s)]
*  Supreme Court conversations about gay marriage in 2023 like why would you fuck why what? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1253.6999999999998s)]
*  We've already had that [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1261.62s)]
*  We passed that we passed that so that's still and if people even want to bring enough for debate like is that real? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1263.62s)]
*  Or is this one of those things that keeps us culturally squabbling and it keeps people like [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1270.3799999999999s)]
*  ideologically connected to one group and [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1276.7399999999998s)]
*  Opposed with all their vitriol the other group the other of the group that they're monsters [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1280.02s)]
*  They're evil the the ruin of society [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1285.26s)]
*  Yeah, and [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1287.62s)]
*  This this fucking bipolar aspect to our society is just it's it's fed by social media [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1289.26s)]
*  It's fed by these fake accounts. It's fed by you know soulless [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1296.62s)]
*  Commentators that the saddest part is when that tribalism comes into your own family, so so here's an incredible story [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1301.82s)]
*  I've appeared on Tucker Carlson. I mean his old show several times on television, but his long-form [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1310.26s)]
*  Podcast that he used to do he had invited us to us meaning my family and I to Florida to do his show [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1317.26s)]
*  He was super gracious super warm with everybody with our kit with my kids and so on and so I put out a tweet [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1324.66s)]
*  Just thanking him for his hospitality. Hey Tucker. It was so nice to meet you [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1330.82s)]
*  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to chat blah blah blah a [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1334.58s)]
*  cousin of mine Joe [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1337.7s)]
*  Who went through the Lebanese Civil War with me and who was my best friend growing up in Lebanon? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1339.3799999999999s)]
*  So you would think that if there's ever a relationship that's cemented in the trials and tribulations of our childhood [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1345.04s)]
*  It would be that relationship. Yeah, so he puts out a tweet and he says something [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1352.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't remember exactly although I quoted in the book on happiness because I'm basically arguing [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1356.84s)]
*  Don't don't live your life like my cousin [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1361.6399999999999s)]
*  He puts out a tweet saying something like have you no shame, right? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1364.24s)]
*  So he decides to publicly shame me for being [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1368.24s)]
*  Associated or agreeing to go on Tucker Carlson's show that shows you what tribalism can do to the human mind [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1373.3999999999999s)]
*  It takes something as difficult as what we went through to the Lebanese Civil War and there [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1379.6599999999999s)]
*  Erases it because he can't believe that I could do something as grotesque as to talk to Tucker Carlson [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1384.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there and if you asked him for example specific examples of why Tucker Carlson is so horrible [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1391.6s)]
*  That's where it would get interesting. Yeah, because some people might be able to say some things [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1398.2s)]
*  They found disagreeable, but most people are just sticking to a narrative. Yeah, there's just this narrative that he is evil incarnate [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1402.46s)]
*  He is a transphobe or whatever it is. He's a he's a Putin stooge [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1409.3s)]
*  Yeah, he's a Putin stooge. There's all these different things, but they they want to ignore all evidence that he's a lovely guy [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1415.42s)]
*  It really is [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1423.3s)]
*  By all accounts by all accounts all the people that I know that have had interactions with him [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1424.82s)]
*  He's a very lovely guy [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1428.94s)]
*  Including my friend Steve Rinella [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1430.7800000000002s)]
*  He had him on a podcast and these people that you know [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1432.3000000000002s)]
*  They had these ideas of who he was before he came on his podcast and he's like they all came away from like and I really [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1435.18s)]
*  Like him. Yeah, he's a really nice guy. Yeah, even if you don't agree with his politics. He seems like a really nice guy [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1440.3000000000002s)]
*  Gracious down-to-earth what what I love you [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1445.5400000000002s)]

*  See how she he or she treats the server at the restaurant [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1454.0400000000002s)]
*  So the way he interacted with my children, right he was focused on them he was so how are you doing? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1457.24s)]
*  How are you? Right? So he's yeah, he's taking his time. He's not acting hottie and I'm this big star [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1464.5s)]
*  He is focused on my children. I thought that was really lovely [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1469.6399999999999s)]
*  That's what I was trying to convey in that tweet but to my cousin that was beyond the pale. Mmm [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1472.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's unfortunate. It's unfortunate that someone would turn on you like that. Yeah, it's just so foolish [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1478.8799999999999s)]
*  It's so foolish because it's first of all that should be something that you would have a conversation with somebody about [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1487.08s)]
*  Like if I care about someone they're they're talking to someone that I find [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1493.48s)]
*  egregious [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1497.76s)]
*  You know, I think you would have a conversation with you call him up. Yeah. Hey, man [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1498.84s)]

*  Yeah [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1526.9s)]
*  and I think Fox News is getting a lot of pushback from people on the right that are very [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1527.22s)]
*  Concerned with you know, some of the decisions they're making and they're they're kind of going down the same path that a lot of these [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1532.8600000000001s)]

*  I know as much as the average person who reads reddit [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1549.98s)]
*  I know some conspiracies. I know I know he was [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1554.22s)]
*  He was like he's kind of wild fella when you think about like what he was doing on a major television show [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1559.7s)]
*  Implicating the CIA and the assassination assassination of John F Kennedy. Yeah, he's saying it was like utmost certainty [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1567.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, right [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1574.54s)]
*  It's like so you think that the reason of firing him was that they they thought that he didn't adhere to some [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1575.5s)]
*  Journalistic ethic or rigor or something like that? I don't know. Yeah, that could be the case. I don't know. Yeah [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1581.3s)]
*  I would think that [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1587.4599999999998s)]
*  When you have a network that's run by advertising, you know, it's what you do for income. Yeah, you know, I would imagine [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1589.86s)]
*  there's a lot of pressure by those people those advertisers to [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1598.58s)]
*  Eliminate threats to their their business. Right? So if you got some [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1603.38s)]

*  Having that kind of stuff on [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1622.06s)]
*  Regular television. It's a big problem to anybody that's selling advertisement. That's in those businesses [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1624.1000000000001s)]
*  Apparently Budweiser didn't learn that lesson [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1630.7s)]
*  Well, see the difference between Budweiser and [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1634.02s)]
*  Pharmaceutical drug companies is that Budweiser is not prescribed right? It's not recommended by your doctor [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1637.42s)]
*  Right, you don't get it. You don't go to CVS to pick it up [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1643.5s)]
*  It's a that's different. And so this is like something that you can't really [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1647.18s)]
*  You can't really criticize a brand and like say yeah [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1653.14s)]
*  We don't we don't buy Pfizer around these parts anymore. Like it doesn't that doesn't work [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1658.1s)]
*  It's not gonna work. You can do that with Budweiser though and you can do that with like [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1663.3s)]
*  That's probably gonna happen with some other stuff too. Like people are upset at the country music channel [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1668.3s)]
*  Jason Aldean try that in a small town. Yeah [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1675.26s)]
*  The level of outrage like now I'm not saying that that's the greatest song the world's ever known, you know [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1678.6599999999999s)]
*  But the level of outrage [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1685.3s)]
*  Coming from people that are upset about that song is so strange when there are [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1687.5s)]
*  Hundreds of rap songs out there. Yeah that are [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1695.06s)]
*  infinitely worse and also enjoyable [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1699.26s)]
*  Misogynistic qualifying violence. Oh, yeah, and no no complaints at all. Yeah. Yeah, and we're not even talking about old stuff [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1702.4199999999998s)]
*  There's new stuff too. There's there's there's hip-hop. There's wild rock songs. There's a lot of wild shit [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1709.82s)]
*  and to be focusing on that one and [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1717.3s)]
*  It it's the racial aspect of it [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1720.26s)]
*  It was crazy because like the real Antifa problems that were happening during the BLM [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1722.6599999999999s)]
*  I think it was a lot of white people doing that, right? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1727.62s)]
*  Isn't it it was a lot of like lost liberal whites who are very angry who decided to take up this movement and smash things [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1730.32s)]
*  So like the racial aspect of it, there's nothing racial about the lyrics or how about the Tracy all did you see the Tracy Allman? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1738.7s)]
*  Controversy no, I did not so she she wrote in the I don't know if you remember and I think was 1988 [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1746.6s)]

*  And then this I guess he's a country music Tracey Chapman Chapman. Yeah, Oman. Oh, that's she's an actress, right? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1756.08s)]
*  She's a comedian. Yes, Tracy Chapman. Check. Yeah, and then this this [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1762.56s)]
*  Singer asked for her permission. I guess to yeah to go home to do a cover and so on [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1767.9599999999998s)]
*  And then people came out that you know, the white guy is asserting this [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1772.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, but that's always gonna happen. You're always gonna have a certain amount of people to say that. Yeah, it doesn't mean it's real [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1777.28s)]
*  It's it also and apparently she's happy that he's doing it. Well, look everybody's good and it's a great song [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1783.96s)]
*  I mean, it's really good to see he didn't even change the gender like when he sang it. Yeah, you know [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1790.34s)]
*  Yeah, I can become a checkout girl. He says check out girl. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what else is up? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1795.6s)]
*  I think we were gonna talk about [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1801.6399999999999s)]
*  What my impression of some of the prices in Austin? Oh, yeah, you were telling me that an espresso was eight dollars [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1804.76s)]
*  so yeah, so yes, yes yesterday I went out with actually I was at my at the hotel and [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1811.4s)]
*  Two friends came by to one of whom I think has been on your show Michael Mallis. Yeah [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1817.52s)]
*  I love that dude. Yeah, he's lovely and the other the other guy is a professor at UT Austin was really Richard Lowery [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1822.24s)]
*  Who's really fighting he's very much of a academic honey badger fighting against all the woke stuff. And so we were just hanging out [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1827.68s)]
*  One of one of the guys ordered a diet coke and two of us ordered two espressos [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1834.76s)]
*  The bill came it was with the tip twenty eight dollars [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1840.96s)]
*  and I'm thinking [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1845.64s)]
*  This is like Oprah money. Like who who can who can [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1847.3600000000001s)]
*  You know afford these prices you [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1851.0400000000002s)]
*  You tell me what's what's going on in Austin, I have no idea I didn't go to that place [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1853.8999999999999s)]
*  But I mean in general the real estate everything is completely doubled tripled. It's it's going [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1858.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean, I understand that it's because it's a hot place. Yeah, but espresso shouldn't be bucks, right? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1863.54s)]
*  espresso cost [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1868.78s)]
*  Well in Montreal, it'll be [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1870.5s)]
*  Montreal would be maybe for an espresso. So it's a short espresso single espresso [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1873.86s)]
*  350 which it's hard for people to believe [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1878.5s)]
*  But when I was growing up there was no Starbucks [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1881.34s)]
*  Right people did not they did not like coffee like they like coffee now [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1884.1s)]
*  They are the greatest drug dealers the world's ever known [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1890.1s)]
*  They're slinging that sweet caffeine all over this country. And that's what it is [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1893.3s)]
*  It's the best drug dealing operation the world's ever known because it's a super mild productive drug that everybody enjoys [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1898.58s)]
*  Yes feels like a warm hug [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1905.5s)]
*  I feel the the requisite drug conversations coming up here. We go on a 30-minute conversation [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1907.78s)]
*  This is like a good drug like caffeine is it like there's whatever bad effects you get from coffee. They're so minimal [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1913.34s)]
*  There's even like links to like good health benefits from it. Yeah, I think there's worried people used to worry about dehydration [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1920.42s)]
*  But I don't think they worry about that as much anymore when it comes to drinking coffee [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1927.84s)]
*  They used to think that if you drank a lot of coffee you would get dehydrated [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1930.7s)]
*  But there's a certain amount of hydration you're actually getting from drinking coffee, too [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1934.42s)]
*  So it's like kind of complicated because it is kind of a diuretic [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1939.78s)]
*  But it also like you're also drinking it so that he perfect segue into one of the chapters of the book [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1942.6200000000001s)]
*  I talk about everything in moderation, which of course [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1948.14s)]
*  Aristotle already talked about the golden mean, you know, if a soldier is too [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1951.46s)]
*  Cowardly, it's not good if he's too reckless. He's going to die [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1956.18s)]
*  Like most things the sweet spot in the middle and so in that chapter I go through a bewildering number of phenomena all of which [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1959.78s)]
*  Adhere to that inverted you too little not good too much is not good and and the ideal point is in the middle [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1968.78s)]
*  Exercise intensity inverted you alcohol consumption inverted you coffee consumption inverted you fish consumption inverted you and so I thought that was a really [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1974.94s)]
*  cool chapter to cover because it's arguably the most universal law of [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1984.0600000000002s)]
*  That we can find so many things adhere to that inverted you [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1989.42s)]
*  And I think we had discussed this last time that I was on the show the ancient Greeks were already aware of it [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1993.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean Aristotle in his Michael [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=1998.74s)]
*  Macian ethics talks exact. I mean he doesn't call it the inverted you he calls it the golden mean and [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2002.14s)]
*  So to our earlier conversation the last time I was here in going through the research for this book the amount of insights [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2007.54s)]
*  I found from [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2013.98s)]
*  Seneca Epictetus [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2015.5800000000002s)]
*  Aristotle Marcus Aurelius was just breathtaking. It was unbelievable. Yeah, I just got back from Greece [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2017.6999999999998s)]
*  Was ever yeah, I was in Greece for two weeks and I saw the Parthenon and we went to elicis went to [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2024.58s)]
*  Dalos went to a bunch of different islands. It was really interesting man. Yeah, we checked out a bunch of ruins and [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2033.1799999999998s)]
*  It's just so [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2042.06s)]
*  It's so hard to even wrap your head around what was going on there [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2044.58s)]
*  2000 plus years ago. Yeah, indeed. I did five islands. So maybe we can compare notes. I did Corfu Crete [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2049.22s)]
*  Naxos [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2058.06s)]
*  Santorini and the fifth one I'm leaving to the end. I asked the captain [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2059.34s)]
*  Take us at the time. I was traveling with a buddy of mine after school. This is 1990 [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2063.38s)]
*  I said take us to an island that's completely void of tourists [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2068.7s)]
*  And so he dropped us off on an island volcanic island called fully gun draws and we spent I think maybe two days there [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2072.3799999999997s)]
*  Not a single tourist just hanging out with the locals. They didn't speak a word of French or English and it was just magical [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2078.8199999999997s)]
*  Wow, where did you go? Which I was to go to? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2084.2999999999997s)]
*  We went to a bunch of them. I can't remember all the names Mekano's. All right, but that that is that's that's tons of tourists [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2087.06s)]
*  right now, there was a lot of people there, you know, we went to [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2094.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm not gonna remember a bunch of weird. Yeah, but it was really it was really fun [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2097.86s)]
*  Yeah, and it was relaxing but the most mind-blowing thing was seeing the Parthenon and see [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2104.22s)]
*  Ulysses and walking around there. Yeah, we just came back from Portugal with the 16 days in Portugal first time ever [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2110.86s)]
*  And it's a loose. It's I'm saying Ulysses. It's a loose. Oh, okay. Yeah. Well [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2118.82s)]
*  really enjoyed [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2123.58s)]
*  Portugal with the exception apologies to all of my Portuguese listeners and fans [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2125.14s)]
*  Not a very attractive language. You don't like that language. I don't like that. It's how you hear it coming out of Brazil [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2129.8599999999997s)]
*  It sounds amazing Brazilian Portuguese is nicer than Portuguese Portuguese [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2135.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm stealing here. Some I think it was a comedian who said this but who said something that like [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2140.74s)]
*  Portuguese is akin to someone having a perpetual stroke in the way that you know [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2147.74s)]
*  Fazao wow, right? There's kind of a twisting of the mouth that appears unnatural [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2153.7s)]
*  And I can see that because I found that it wasn't the most pleasant. So now I'm gonna get hate mail from Portuguese [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2159.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they're gonna be very mad at you because Brazilian Portuguese is beautiful. It's got it's got a flow. It's got a flow [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2165.66s)]
*  It's like there's like a but I mean [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2171.46s)]
*  Italian, you know, it's a universally loved language French as spoken in France now. I'm going to upset the next [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2174.3799999999997s)]
*  Quebec French is an affront to human dignity. What? Yes, sir. I'm I said it what yes, it's horrifying [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2182.06s)]
*  I can't believe what you're saying. Now. Listen to this. My wife is able to switch her French [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2189.98s)]
*  Depending on whom she's speaking with so if she's speaking with someone who speaks international French [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2196.1s)]
*  She'll speak in a regular manner not Parisian French, but like an international French [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2201.58s)]
*  I speak an international French because we're from Lebanon when she speaks to a Quebecer [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2206.3399999999997s)]
*  She turns into a complete Quebecer and oftentimes I say how did you just do that? That sounds so inauthentic [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2211.1s)]
*  She was well, no because if I speak in the regular French [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2217.02s)]
*  Then it'll come across as hottie [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2220.42s)]
*  But that to me is so strange because that would be like I speak with an Oxford accent with one person [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2222.62s)]
*  Right, and I turn into the southern drawl with the other person depending on who that doesn't sound that there's a falsity to that [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2227.9s)]
*  There's a good argument it's a falsity to that [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2237.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but there's also a good argument that [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2239.58s)]
*  Like there's like a cultural agreed upon way of communicating [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2243.02s)]
*  You know, like if you started talking like there for all thou [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2248.66s)]
*  Like you started talking like that today people go. What are you doing, man? Right? We don't talk like that anymore [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2252.06s)]
*  Do you think I have an accent in English? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2256.74s)]
*  You don't have an accent you have a very distinct way of talking. Okay, so you couldn't say [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2259.3s)]
*  You're American or Canadian it's you well you have this is there's that like your your words are very clear [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2267.58s)]
*  But there's like there's something going on, right? Yeah, it's clear. There's something going on there, right? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2273.8999999999996s)]
*  But that's a fascinating thing about a person that's able to speak multiple languages [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2279.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like you're speaking English, but you're speaking English perfectly with like a little bit of a twist to it, right? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2283.8999999999996s)]
*  Which is I guess an accent so I guess the answer is yeah my arguably my only regret as a parent so far [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2290.74s)]
*  May it be the only one that I ever experienced has been that we haven't [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2297.22s)]
*  Passed on our linguistic heritage we meaning my wife and I to our children [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2302.3799999999997s)]
*  So I speak you know Arabic is my mother tongue French English and Hebrew [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2307.3399999999997s)]
*  My wife speaks Armenian and so between the two of us [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2312.5s)]
*  We've got five languages and yet our children only speak French and English and the reason for that is because if I were to speak to [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2316.4599999999996s)]
*  them in Arabic or Hebrew [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2323.3599999999997s)]
*  My mother my wife would be locked out and if she speaks to them in Armenian [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2325.36s)]
*  I would be locked out and so we ended up just agreeing on the two the two languages that we both speak [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2330.44s)]
*  But now both both our children are telling us that they've because when they see me meeting someone who's Arabic and we that we break [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2335.76s)]
*  Out the beautiful Arabic at least my son has been saying you know that he should only speak to me in in Arabic [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2342.96s)]
*  But now it feels as if it's a vocabulary lesson, right? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2348.92s)]
*  So I'm telling him here is how you say he goes no, but just speak to me, right? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2352.9s)]
*  But that's easy to do when you're you know one year old when you're 11 12 13 [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2357.7s)]
*  It's it feels false to start speaking to you in Arabic when you don't speak a word of Arabic, you know [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2362.82s)]
*  Yeah, but that's a great way for him to learn. Yeah indeed wouldn't it be? Yeah, of course, cuz you'd have to keep up [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2368.16s)]
*  You'd have to keep up. Yeah, that's what they say [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2373.42s)]
*  Like if you really want to learn a language really want to learn it just move to a place [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2375.78s)]
*  Oh, absolutely [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2379.1s)]
*  I mean one of the things that I regret the most is that I haven't been able to return ever to Lebanon because if I [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2380.02s)]
*  Were to go to on a visiting professorship to say American University of Beirut for a year [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2384.98s)]
*  They're going to come back flawless Arabic speakers [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2389.98s)]
*  And especially I mean now my daughter's 14. He's 11 [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2393.2999999999997s)]
*  So they're sort of entering that period where they pretty much soon not going to be able to ever speak it like a native speaker [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2396.7999999999997s)]
*  There's something magical that happens around puberty [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2404.1s)]
*  Where if you learn a language after that period you could never speak it without an accent really [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2407.38s)]
*  Yeah, and it really is and no one exactly knows what what causes that mechanism? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2413.64s)]
*  but so for example, I learned English at 11 and [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2419.22s)]
*  That's that was the Genesis for why I asked you do I have an accent because I would expect that the time at which I learned [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2424.02s)]
*  It I snuck in just before that period had I learned it when I was 13 14 15 [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2429.94s)]
*  I could have spoken it, you know perfectly but you would have detected a much stronger accent. That's interesting [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2436.02s)]
*  You know, that's a strange thing about human development and and just the sounds that we all agree upon that equal the words [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2442.66s)]
*  Well, there are tons of sounds in Arabic. Let's see if you can do them [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2450.5s)]
*  You ready first time ever on the Joe Rogan. Give me a try. Okay. So for example my last name [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2454.24s)]
*  Everybody all Americans will say sad you just extend the a [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2459.74s)]
*  But the proper way to say it it's good side side right it's like Arnold like if Arnold was gonna say [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2463.5400000000004s)]
*  Or for example [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2473.1000000000004s)]
*  Can you say hey? Not good. There's a [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2475.26s)]
*  And yeah, they're coming from different parts from my throat. What? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2478.82s)]
*  Those are all so if I say if I say that the Arabic people are going to laugh at this [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2484.0600000000004s)]
*  And the Hara that means you're shit, okay, okay, it's a [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2488.82s)]
*  Okay, and the mod that means you're you're an ass. Okay, you're an idiot say it again and the second one [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2493.5s)]
*  Yeah, and the mod in the mod, but see you're saying it's [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2500.7400000000002s)]
*  First time ever are we breaking new ground? Yeah for sure. I've never even tried to say these words. Yeah. Yeah, it's you know, it's Arabic [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2510.46s)]
*  Earlier I said some derogatory things about Portuguese and about French-Canadian. So let me be fair and say not Arabic [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2517.98s)]
*  Hebrew which is also you know one of them from my heritage is a [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2526.82s)]
*  violently ugly language [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2532.34s)]
*  on the other hand [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2534.66s)]
*  Arabic as spoken by the Lebanese and I'm not saying this because I'm living because you know Arabic comes in many different dialects [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2537.1s)]
*  There's Iraqi Arabic there is North African Arabic there's Egyptian Arabic the Lebanese Arabic is really the the Italian of [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2542.74s)]
*  Arabic dialects [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2551.22s)]
*  Get ready for some comments and I'll come in your way [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2553.14s)]
*  Isn't it weird how when they have horror movies when whenever someone's like calling a demon they always have to do it in an old language [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2556.06s)]
*  Meaning like what it's always in Latin or something. Oh, right. Okay, they're always reading from some book [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2563.9399999999996s)]
*  Reading from what does it say? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2568.98s)]
*  And then the demons come like you have to say the magic old words that people don't understand [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2574.86s)]
*  There's probably some weird your psychology. Yes, you understand that shit. That's interesting. What's going on there? Yeah [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2580.42s)]
*  Why just it's always right? There's like a dead language [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2587.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, or an old language because of that there so because it's an extinct language. It's somehow calling demons [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2590.1400000000003s)]
*  Calling demons that exist in another world [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2596.5s)]
*  I think it's as simple as that [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2598.82s)]
*  What a dumb concept that the way to call demons is like by saying a word like making a noise with your mouth [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2600.3s)]
*  It's the perfect or say candy man in front of the in front of the mirror three times [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2606.34s)]
*  Scariest movie of all time since we were talking earlier about our favorite movie Halloween first one Jamie Lee Curtis [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2612.78s)]
*  Till today I would probably have a heart see what scares me about horror movies is not the supernatural stuff [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2620.3599999999997s)]
*  It's the being startled [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2626.8799999999997s)]
*  You see what I mean? What he comes and you write so oftentimes when I'm watching a horror movie [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2629.3599999999997s)]
*  I will block my ears because it's that sudden sound that really scares me [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2634.3599999999997s)]
*  I think if I had to pick an all-time scariest movie, I [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2640.64s)]
*  Think I would see the first alien [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2645.72s)]

*  The aliens are kind of out in the open and you shoot a bunch of them. They're coming from all over the place [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2656.8399999999997s)]

*  Wait, we can get it. Have you seen the documentary of the making of alien? I have it's amazing. It's amazing [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=2664.16s)]

*  I'm I was citing other works that looked at what happens to the testosterone levels of [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3056.88s)]
*  Fans as a function of whether their team wins or loses. Of course [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3062.64s)]
*  You just take salivary assays of fans as their team is [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3069.12s)]
*  Losing yeah [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3073.88s)]
*  And so now what it's not surprising as you would know as a fighter that if [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3077.12s)]
*  You and I fight and you defeat me your testosterone level goes up. My testosterone level goes down like a video game like a video game [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3083.2400000000002s)]
*  Except what's happening here is that there is a vicarious? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3090.64s)]
*  And the chronological response the fans are having the same [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3094.72s)]
*  Increases in their testosterone levels or decreases as a function of their team winning or not [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3099.0s)]
*  That's quite extra and that shows you why it we become so bonded to our favorite players and so on [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3104.16s)]
*  We are really going through this battle with them [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3109.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's it's really the case with fighters when people have a fighter that they're really a giant fan of and that person gets [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3112.24s)]
*  Beaten a devastating man. Yeah, it's all heartbreaking [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3120.2799999999997s)]
*  There is even studies by the way that have looked at what happened [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3123.7999999999997s)]
*  to [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3128.64s)]
*  sexual behavior of fans after their team wins or loses [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3129.68s)]
*  So if if let's say you if your wife is upset that you're not you haven't been producing in the bedroom [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3134.56s)]
*  She should pray that the husband's favorite team wins because if he wins he has an ink [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3141.56s)]
*  increase in testosterone level increases their libidinal drive and so [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3148.08s)]
*  We're animals [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3153.56s)]
*  it's just [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3155.16s)]
*  it's just [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3156.7999999999997s)]
*  Attaching so much of your own emotions to something completely out of control and just rooting on it [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3158.3599999999997s)]
*  Exactly, but do you do you have a fan in any sport where you've ever been that vested in? Well, I [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3163.8399999999997s)]
*  There was one time I remember when I was a kid [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3171.3199999999997s)]
*  I was a giant fan of Donald Curry [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3173.96s)]
*  Donald Curry was the welterweight boxing champion at the time and he had a rivalry with this other guy Milton McCrory and [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3176.88s)]
*  Donald Curry knocked him out. He became like my favorite boxer and then Donald Curry he got beat by this guy Lloyd Hunnigan [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3185.68s)]
*  It was a devastating loss like people couldn't believe Lloyd Hunnigan beat Donald Curry and [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3191.96s)]
*  It was like Donald Curry might be on the downslide [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3197.12s)]
*  but I was still like a giant fan of his and [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3199.44s)]
*  Then Donald Curry fought Mike McCallum and Mike McCallum hit him with a left hook to the body and a left hook to the chin [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3202.0s)]
*  And put him out [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3209.04s)]
*  Like out cold I couldn't believe it and I ran here it is right here I [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3210.84s)]
*  Ran out of the house watch this boom [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3217.1400000000003s)]
*  So that they'll cold the one with the black shorts is your guy right the guy down it's my guy, okay [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3222.08s)]
*  So I I [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3229.7200000000003s)]
*  Misremembered it wasn't a left hook to the body was like he goes with a right hand and then a left hook behind it [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3232.44s)]
*  But he just he KO'd [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3238.6000000000004s)]
*  K. Oh Donald Curry, and I couldn't believe it and so I put up my running shoes [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3241.1200000000003s)]
*  I couldn't stay home. I could just couldn't deal with it. I couldn't deal with it. I went running in the snow [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3246.32s)]
*  and I ran [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3251.48s)]
*  Ain't no windows in the snow [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3253.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm thinking of another story. There's another time when someone lost that I went running in the snow [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3255.76s)]
*  I don't think it was in the snow. I think was warm [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3259.08s)]
*  I don't put it I don't remember but I remember I went running and as I'm running and I'm running down the road [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3260.48s)]
*  I'm thinking myself. I am never gonna be this invested in someone else winning or losing ever again [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3265.1s)]
*  I was so devastated that he lost what what was the bond what what why why technique technique was perfect [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3270.94s)]
*  He was crisp like he was coiled. They called him [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3279.02s)]
*  His is what was his nickname something Cobra [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3283.2599999999998s)]
*  Here comes Jamie I [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3288.02s)]
*  Forget what his nickname was [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3292.14s)]
*  But his his technique was so crisp Lone Star Cobra Lone Star Cobra. He was out of Fort Worth and [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3294.7s)]
*  His technique was so sharp [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3302.3799999999997s)]
*  I just really I always admired guys who were able to find like the shortest path to [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3304.18s)]
*  Connecting with a shot. Yeah, it's just like the technique is so dialed in yeah [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3311.1s)]
*  There's guys that like Gervonta Davis is like that their technique so dialed in that when you watch them uncork [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3316.06s)]
*  Oh my god the efficiency of it the way and so I was just a giant fan of the guy [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3322.34s)]
*  I just loved as a person who like really enjoyed technique. I watch him someone is exceptional [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3328.02s)]
*  I recently put out a few months ago. I put out a sort of a hypothetical what-if scenario where I [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3333.9s)]
*  Think this was on Twitter where I asked, you know people who follow me [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3341.5s)]
*  would I be able to step on an NFL field and [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3345.98s)]
*  Under any circumstance [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3351.38s)]
*  Simply get a single yard as a running back, right? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3353.9s)]
*  So in other words, right right. So now for example, if I go into a boxing ring with someone [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3358.7799999999997s)]
*  the only way I'm going to survive is if I keep running around long enough because the [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3365.02s)]
*  Singular time that they hit me I'm unlikely to be able to withstand that right? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3370.14s)]
*  So that's I'm gone, right if I play basketball [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3374.42s)]
*  I think I have enough skills that I can receive the ball and pass it off to someone right and so then I started thinking [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3377.2599999999998s)]
*  What about other sports? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3383.38s)]
*  Could the average person who doesn't play that sport survive long enough to do something? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3385.46s)]
*  I'm obviously not going to get a hundred yards, but a single yard. What are your thoughts? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3390.74s)]
*  I thought maybe I was being presumptuous [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3394.82s)]
*  Maybe and I'm an old guy [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3397.18s)]
*  But I thought that it could be possible for the front line to make enough of a hole for me to run through for one [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3398.9s)]
*  Year, and I would just drop I just need to get a single year [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3405.06s)]
*  That's possible and but a lot of people thought there is no chance that that would happen because they would catch you in there in the back [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3407.74s)]
*  Field they would tackle you and then you would die [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3414.1s)]
*  Well, they probably could do that too that could happen as well [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3416.62s)]
*  But if the defense is so strong that they can just create a small enough opening for you to go one yard [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3419.7799999999997s)]
*  I think that's reasonable. Yeah, you would suck for you though, dude. They're gonna pile on top of you [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3425.58s)]
*  You're never gonna be this especially since I've lost so much weight at least before I looked like a linebacker a fat linebacker [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3430.86s)]
*  Yeah, that was you don't want that happening to you. What was that? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3437.2200000000003s)]
*  Watch this guy. This is the running back trying to get the ball to get one yard watch this [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3441.9s)]
*  Bam his helmets off and he's hurt. Oh my god [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3447.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's one of five guys that are just gonna try to stop you from doing tack old [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3451.5s)]
*  Guys are so powerful. So Jamie's in the camp of I'm not getting a single yard. There's a lot of well [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3455.6200000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of other variables [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3461.0600000000004s)]
*  But it is possible that the defense could have prevented that if the defense is extraordinary [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3462.1800000000003s)]
*  And the guys are on point and there's there's you know [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3467.9s)]
*  Games things happen, right people are trying to control things and people are charging forward [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3471.5s)]
*  It's possible that there's an opening just big enough for anyone to get three yards, right? [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3477.0600000000004s)]
*  Or one yard rather if you do you think you could step on a soccer field and look anything short of a complete moron? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3483.38s)]
*  No, no possible. I know I saw you recently and I was really delighted to hear that where you were [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3491.06s)]
*  Singing the praises of how fit soccer players. Oh my god [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3497.34s)]
*  We went to see the the games here in Austin and when you watch professionals, first of all [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3500.3s)]
*  Here's one reason why soccer is problematic for television. They don't get breaks. Yeah, so there's no breaks like, you know [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3505.02s)]
*  We'll be right back with another word from the miss girl [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3511.86s)]
*  There's none of that. So if you have commercials like you have to interrupt the play the game [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3514.9s)]
*  Yeah, and then people have to catch up and then it's not is it not live now [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3520.2200000000003s)]
*  Or you're gonna like have half of a commercial and half of the game like what are you gonna do? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3523.76s)]
*  Yeah, how are you gonna do that? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3527.6s)]
*  Cuz they don't stop they just keep going and you have to be insanely fit [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3528.7400000000002s)]
*  Those guys look like thoroughbreds like their legs were just fucking shredded. So there was a study a few years ago [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3532.76s)]
*  I can't cite what it was but I looked at who were the fittest athletes number one was soccer [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3540.1s)]
*  It has to be you know what number two was no squash players [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3545.1s)]
*  Why I'm guessing because there are a lot of those very very quick [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3548.86s)]
*  Accelerations that you have to engage in to be able to get the ball is very dead, right? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3554.18s)]
*  Hmm, and so you really have to have this incredible quickness to be able to [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3558.7799999999997s)]
*  So I weird thing for an elite athlete to choose [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3563.94s)]
*  Jamie can we check the rankings? I could describe squash [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3567.78s)]
*  You know, I tried to play it. I got very claustrophobic. I'm being serious because let me see what it looks like [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3572.54s)]
*  Show me a squash game. It's like a [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3578.94s)]
*  Racquetball right? No, but with us with a ball that's more dead racquetball. The ball has a lot more give [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3582.26s)]
*  It bounces more. I was just trying to look I found other sports that sound like they would be more [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3589.38s)]
*  But I didn't find it on a scientific study. My wife has been trying to get me into pickleball. What are what are our thoughts about that? I [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3594.34s)]
*  Hear people like it. Have I just lost the no point. Oh, come on man. People like pickleball [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3602.86s)]
*  Well, apparently there's a whole craze of pickleball now because it's not quite as difficult as tennis [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3610.42s)]
*  You don't have to cover as much ground. It's still a racket game [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3615.78s)]
*  It looks like a lot of damage to the knees son. That's what I'm looking at right there in terms of squash [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3618.92s)]
*  You're running around. Yeah, a lot of fucking explosive movements for old guys like us. Yeah. Yeah best stick to yoga [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3623.22s)]

*  Balls the way to go son, but by the way, and I'm not gonna say call it ping-pong table tennis [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3635.86s)]
*  Oh my god insane. I I watch a lot of it when I was when I was a graduate student [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3641.6s)]
*  There was a fellow student who were roughly the same level so we can have these wrong long rallies [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3646.7400000000002s)]
*  We play for two three hours. We'd be drenched. Oh, it's very very very athletic [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3652.24s)]
*  It's also amazing to watch like their reads [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3656.9199999999996s)]
*  Like knowing where the balls come in and to be able to get to the side of the table and the back it over there [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3659.68s)]
*  And then it steps sideways and dudes are hitting them behind their backs. It's beautiful wild [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3664.52s)]
*  Wilds beautiful. Those exchanges are so fast [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3670.04s)]
*  It's a crit and you're just this little ball just tracking this little ball whacking it with your thing [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=3674.04s)]

*  He had crazy flexibility like ridiculous flexibility and mobility [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4057.4599999999996s)]
*  He did all these mobility drills and you watch his workouts they were [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4062.1s)]
*  Extraordinary because like he's doing a lot of things like shield casts with giant steel plates [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4066.14s)]
*  So he's doing a lot of this shit. So it's like [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4071.86s)]
*  Rotational muscles his ability to manipulate things in awkward positions was off the charts [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4075.02s)]
*  It was all like heavy kettlebell work [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4080.62s)]
*  That guy was a freak and his mobility he would show all these mobility drills and different things. Look what he's doing [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4083.18s)]
*  Oh my goodness, look at this. I mean, this is the fucking Olympic gold medalist wrestler [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4089.58s)]
*  What year is this 80s? I? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4095.1s)]
*  Think his last [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4098.22s)]
*  Wrestling matches were around I want to say before [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4101.5s)]
*  2000 because he did have offers he had like one Fagazi MMA fight [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4104.78s)]
*  It was like a fake MMA fight because they did a few of those in Japan [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4110.0199999999995s)]
*  They still they had a weird sort of symbiosis with pro wrestling and MMA [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4114.34s)]
*  And so there was MMA fights in Japan that are allegedly fixed and they look fixed you watching me going [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4119.7s)]
*  It's like you see like a fake tap you see like someone giving their arm up or something [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4127.34s)]
*  There was some of that going on and so it seems like he got involved in one of those where they gave him a shit [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4133.1s)]
*  Ton of money and they said come over here. It's kind of pro wrestling [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4138.46s)]
*  We're kind of not we'll say it's an MMA fights one of those deals [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4140.98s)]
*  But if he did fight MMA everyone would be fucked [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4144.0199999999995s)]
*  Everyone everyone would be fucked and if you figure out how to strike, oh my Jesus, you know, I I'm not sure if I've talked about this before [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4148.54s)]
*  but [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4157.42s)]
*  the precursor of MMA I had had that conversation with my brother the judo guy because [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4158.5s)]
*  We would go out to nightclubs and he would he's very very small guy [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4164.9s)]
*  Probably five foot three but built like a pit bull and he'd he'd kind of interact with the world as though [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4169.38s)]
*  He's six foot eight the bouncers and so on and I once asked him [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4175.1s)]
*  Do you think you can take these guys and he said if I can get them? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4179.1s)]
*  But if they knock me out before I get to them then they knock me out [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4184.06s)]
*  But if I get them and I can bring them down then they're dead [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4187.38s)]
*  And I think from my very very limited knowledge of MMA the guys who usually win are precisely those guys who can do exactly [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4190.92s)]
*  What he said, right? [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4197.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4199.3s)]
*  Sort of but kind of everybody knows how to defend that now [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4200.5s)]
*  It's just how well can you defend and how good of a striker is that wrestler? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4203.719999999999s)]
*  Because this gentleman who's coming up on the scene right now [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4209.5599999999995s)]
*  His name is Bo nickel and he's an elite like blue chip wrestler like a lead wrestler [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4212.36s)]
*  Like Olympic caliber wrestler and now he's competing in MMA and his last fight was a first round knockout with his hands [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4219.0s)]
*  And he showed he's got sick boxing skills, too [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4226.12s)]
*  Which is the most terrifying thing when you got a guy who's above and beyond you in grappling [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4229.72s)]
*  Like once he gets a hold of you, you're fucksville. There's no way you have one good one way taking the fuck [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4236.8s)]
*  So he's gonna slam you to the ground. He's gonna control. He's gonna beat your ass [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4241.6s)]
*  They're just too good at wrestling right and then also he can fuck you upstanding. That's where it gets really dangerous [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4244.88s)]
*  So if a guy like Karelin learn how to stand up [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4250.0s)]
*  That would have been the end because there's certain freaks that like you just like athletic freaks [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4253.16s)]
*  You just like I don't know. What are you gonna do with that? [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4258.92s)]
*  What are you gonna do so in the MMA in the history of MMA? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4261.12s)]
*  Is there someone that is akin to messy in terms of like a Michael Jordan or a messy in the MMA? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4264.320000000001s)]
*  There's a few there's a few that are in that conversation [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4269.52s)]
*  I think the number one consensus greatest of all time is John Jones [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4272.14s)]
*  Because John Jones just went up and easily won the heavyweight title with the first round submission easily just took the guy down [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4275.8s)]
*  Strangled him quick and the way he did it was like so extraordinary [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4282.360000000001s)]
*  His control of distance his management of the space like the way he set it up [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4285.88s)]
*  It's it's really tough to argue that he's not the greatest of all time [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4290.72s)]
*  Undefeated as a light heavyweight had one defeat that was a disqualification. That's a hundred percent bullshit [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4294.36s)]
*  He was on top of this guy smashing him beating the fuck out of him [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4299.56s)]
*  But they said that he did 12 to 6 elbows, which are the dumbest fucking ever [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4303.22s)]
*  Rule in MMA cuz what if it's 1205 what if it's 1205? What does that mean? [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4309.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. Yeah from the position of the clock. Okay, an elbow straight down is illegal [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4313.66s)]
*  Oh, I see doesn't make any sense. Yeah, you have to do it sideways [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4317.92s)]
*  What how do you do it at an angle? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4320.78s)]
*  But it's literally because the athletic commissions that were sanctioning MMA initially [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4322.78s)]
*  They said, you know, we've seen those things on ESPN where people break bricks with their elbows. You can't do that [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4328.82s)]
*  It's too dangerous. So you can't do that on the ground. You can't even do it standing up [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4335.0s)]
*  I don't believe I think if someone comes straight at you and Tomahawk elbows [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4339.1s)]
*  I believe that's illegal. Hmm. I'm not sure about that, but on the ground it's most certainly illegal and it's the dumbest rule [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4342.54s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4348.78s)]
*  A regular elbow is just as hard an elbow like this is just as I might be more hard [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4349.82s)]
*  Because you can kind of get more of your shoulder into it where this might be a more awkward move that I mean [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4355.34s)]
*  I don't I'm not the best at this but I would think that this is not as good as this [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4361.64s)]
*  This seems like I'm getting a lot of weight into that. I'm getting the torque off my hips [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4366.46s)]
*  This I'm kind of coming up and down [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4371.139999999999s)]
*  I feel like I have more ability to generate force going sideways going into it like that [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4373.139999999999s)]
*  So I don't I think if you measured it, I bet it would be I bet this elbow stronger for like the elite fighters [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4379.82s)]
*  So it's not a matter of like whether or not it makes sense. It's a dumb rule [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4385.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's the only time you ever lost [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4390.0s)]
*  Yeah, you have to squat for the only time you ever lost other than that [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4392.0599999999995s)]
*  Like he's like at certain point times his career. He was like playing with his food [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4395.0199999999995s)]
*  Like he let fights go on too long where he's like almost disinterested [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4399.42s)]
*  And again, like he wanted to try standing up with guys who were supposedly great strikers [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4403.259999999999s)]
*  Did just decided not to try to take people down [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4407.34s)]
*  Just try to do whatever the fuck you wanted to do because he's so much better than everybody was getting bored [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4409.58s)]
*  And then when he has like big challenges like this second Daniel Cormier fight stop Cormier with a head kick [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4414.42s)]
*  But she's he's so fucking good. I mean he's beaten so many people and the way he beat him [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4419.58s)]
*  He fought leota machida and it's one of the most cold-blooded [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4425.54s)]
*  Finishes in the history of the sport. He has machida and he grabs them at the [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4429.82s)]
*  At the cage presses them against the cage and gets them in this perfect power guillotine [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4435.9400000000005s)]
*  Puts them to sleep and then drops him and walks away [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4442.58s)]
*  Watch this watch this so he grabs a hold of them they get this exchange and [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4446.82s)]
*  John catches this he gets him in this knee to the body and then he catches him in this standing crank [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4451.740000000001s)]
*  So see how he's doing that he's compressing machidas head to his chest completely putting him out like there's nowhere to go [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4456.740000000001s)]
*  He's 100% out cold and so look at that. It just dropped my goodness and walks away cold [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4463.14s)]
*  blooded cold blooded that's the goat that's the greatest of all time and [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4470.02s)]
*  When he's challenged that's when like I said the second Daniel Cormier fight [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4475.9s)]
*  There was so much bad blood between them when he's challenged really challenged [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4480.419999999999s)]
*  That's when you see how good he really is [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4484.0199999999995s)]
*  The problem is he's so much better than almost everybody that ever has done the sport [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4485.7s)]
*  That he at certain times just got too distracted partying a lot fucking off a lot [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4490.219999999999s)]
*  But do you think there are any personality traits? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4496.54s)]
*  That predict people who are likely to be interested in MMA fighting versus other sports there's so many personalities [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4499.9s)]
*  It's really interesting the diversity and personalities in MMA is really [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4506.9s)]
*  Fascinating to me as a person who's an analyst like there are people that are very calm and [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4512.18s)]
*  Disciplined and religious like people like the greatest like Khabib number coming off [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4518.62s)]
*  Who's also in the conversation of who's the greatest of all time? He's also in that conversation [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4522.7s)]
*  He's a [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4526.06s)]
*  Azerbaijan or was it Dagestan? [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4527.14s)]
*  He's he's in the conversation of the greatest of all time because it's not even a matter of whether he lost because he never lost [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4529.26s)]
*  He's 29 and oh, it's a matter of did he ever lose a round? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4535.820000000001s)]
*  Hmm, he lost maybe one round in the Conor McGregor fight because in the Conor McGregor fight [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4539.46s)]
*  He was in one round. It looked like he was kind of taking a round off to really put the heat on him [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4545.1s)]
*  It was slowing Connor down [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4550.9400000000005s)]
*  He was just taking him down and beating the shit out of him beating the shit out of him yelling at him [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4553.06s)]
*  Let's talk now. Let's talk because he was so much like trash talk during and you know [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4556.700000000001s)]
*  It was a very emotionally charged fight [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4560.6s)]
*  And I think he might have lost one round in that fight where Connor got the best of him standing [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4562.9400000000005s)]
*  Because Connor still an elite motherfucker what but other than that his whole career is just domination [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4567.820000000001s)]
*  There's one fight that he had with glazen t bow that was a controversial fight was a close fight [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4574.02s)]
*  But that's very early in his career when you look at him against guys like world-class competition [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4578.5s)]
*  You know guys like Edson Barboza guys like Michael Johnson like the domination that he [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4584.14s)]
*  Showed on these guys was just fucking off the charts. He just take him down mount them [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4589.74s)]
*  Tie their legs up with his legs and beat the fuck out of him and he did it to everybody. He did it to everybody. What's your [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4595.62s)]
*  Preference in terms of do you like the showy? [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4602.78s)]
*  Talkers or do you have no preference? I love them all I love it all [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4606.219999999999s)]
*  I love the guys to talk a lot of shit and I love the guys that are like could be that are stoic and just [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4610.099999999999s)]
*  Get the job done see because in soccer, of course, you've had this perennial [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4614.179999999999s)]
*  Discussion about you know, Messi versus Ronaldo. I don't really think there is a debate Messi is much better [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4619.42s)]
*  But I also am I admire his humility, right? [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4624.82s)]
*  If there ever was someone who should have a chip on his shoulder should be Messi probably the most famous person in the world [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4629.2s)]
*  Who's done it all and yet he really walks around as though he's he's nobody on the other hand [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4635.4800000000005s)]
*  Ronaldo is a big showboat if you ask Ronaldo who's the greatest player ever? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4640.44s)]
*  He'll say it's me [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4643.8s)]
*  Whereas if you ask Messi he'll list ten people and he won't put himself on that list [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4645.2s)]
*  And so there there is there is a way by which he engages in his personal conduct that I think is really admirable [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4649.36s)]
*  Admirable that you know, he truly is a role model, right? Yeah, that's beautiful [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4656.48s)]
*  So I'm wondering so from the perspective of because there's a lot of showboating and foot fighters, right? [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4660.879999999999s)]
*  I'm the greatest ever and you know, I'm gonna knock you out [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4666.28s)]
*  I would have thought that you'd probably be more into the understated guys [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4669.12s)]
*  No [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4673.599999999999s)]
*  No, I'm all into whatever the fuck you're into like I like the Conor McGregor wears diamond encrusted watches and drives around a Lamborghini [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4674.719999999999s)]
*  I fucking love it. I know I know that dude grew up poor that dude was [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4682.08s)]
*  Was struggling early in his MMA career and wasn't even sure if he was gonna continue fighting, right? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4687.56s)]
*  You know, I became a fan of his watching him fight in the UK [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4692.8s)]
*  I watched him fight on YouTube and I reached out to him like [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4697.64s)]
*  2013 I sent him a message [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4702.04s)]
*  Saying I hope one day you come over to the UFC. Love to love to see your fights might have been earlier than 2000 [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4703.96s)]
*  2013 but I was like, I think he's I knew he was legit like back then there's something special [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4711.96s)]
*  He's been on this show many times. No, he hasn't been on the show ever. No kidding. No, I definitely have him on though [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4717.2s)]

*  I think he did some questionable shit. That's no doubt some things that he shouldn't have done [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4728.16s)]
*  Do you are many of your closest fighters? [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4732.3s)]

*  I think there is quite a bit of personal demons that he's had to face in his life [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4802.3s)]
*  And so it seems like a gripping story apparently likes to party. Oh, is that right? Yeah [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4806.5s)]

*  Yeah, Jamie knows how to fucking slow him up. He's the all-time greatest truth-checker [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4833.7s)]
*  Well, he's the goat of podcast producers. He's the goat everybody else. He's the messy of podcast 100% [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4838.179999999999s)]

*  Literally if someone does a content analysis of our conversation so far they wouldn't know that I'm here [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4856.98s)]
*  I've just sat and smiled at your beautiful face. Oh [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4863.0199999999995s)]

*  Words I'm seeing on my recording. It's like 50-50. No minutes. It is not [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4871.86s)]

*  What's upsetting you? What's making you happy? What's I'm more worried than ever about the the cultural narratives [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4888.46s)]
*  I'm more worried than ever about like the [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4895.7s)]
*  the fucking divide in this country. Yeah, it seems so [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4899.0599999999995s)]
*  Accelerated whether it's climate change or Ukraine or whatever the subject de jour is [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4904.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's everyone's so [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4912.42s)]
*  Stereotypically on one side or the other have you lost any [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4915.66s)]
*  personal friendships [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4920.46s)]
*  Because of ideological issues. No, not real friendships. Okay, maybe acquaintances [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4922.46s)]
*  But that was okay. Those are good if you can clean those up [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4927.74s)]
*  Yeah, you find out who you really who's really your friend, you know, even people that I'd like [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4931.68s)]
*  vehemently disagreed with about [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4937.2s)]
*  Certain policies that were in place during the pandemic. Yeah, they're still my friends [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4939.4800000000005s)]
*  Right, we can have disagreements. I know who the core of you is and [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4944.88s)]
*  People think about things differently. We're free to think about things differently [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4949.28s)]
*  We're some people are free to have a perspective that I don't agree with [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4952.56s)]
*  It's like and you might be able to back it up with some facts, you know, you might be able to or you might be [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4957.0s)]
*  Intolerant to the other opposition views because some of them are full shit. Maybe that's true, too [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4965.08s)]
*  There's a lot going on but it's very hard for people to when especially in times of crisis [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4971.68s)]
*  Like when during the pandemic you kind of found out [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4976.6s)]
*  how human beings are very malleable and and very [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4979.8s)]
*  Quick to pick a narrative that they support and especially if that narrative offers a promise of going back to normal [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4984.0s)]
*  You know and that was what was weird about that is like this is a [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4992.24s)]
*  psychological [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4996.08s)]
*  Like a test study if you wanted to do a test study of how a population even a free [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=4997.400000000001s)]
*  supposedly free population free thinking free freedom of expression freedom of speech is literally in the the doctrine that we run the law by and [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5003.24s)]
*  To have people willing to throw that away [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5012.5199999999995s)]
*  quickly [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5016.5199999999995s)]
*  Under something that wasn't even it's not we're not talking about a nuclear war [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5017.799999999999s)]
*  We're talking about something that's like relatively in terms of the amount of people that die every year [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5022.04s)]
*  It's not good. It certainly wasn't a good thing to anybody 99.7% [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5027.5199999999995s)]
*  survival yeah, and [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5032.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean again, it's not a good thing, right? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5035.32s)]
*  It's not good to get any kind of cold any kind of disease any kind of like illness. It's not good [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5038.96s)]
*  But there's a lot of shit that's killing people also and there's almost no effort to stop that [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5044.52s)]
*  Like there's no effort to stop the comorbidities that caused a lot of the problems that a lot of those people that didn't survive had [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5051.2s)]
*  there's no effort to stop that in terms of like what we understand about health and wellness and [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5057.96s)]
*  promoting that you're referring to obesity and not just obesity, but like [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5063.92s)]
*  Malnutrition vitamin deficiencies like so many people are eating but they're they're malnourished [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5068.68s)]
*  Sure, there's it's a giant portion of our population [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5073.56s)]
*  That is not getting the proper nutrients every day and there's a host of diseases that come along with that [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5076.58s)]
*  Yeah, and it's just not being discussed [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5081.32s)]
*  I mean, it's it's it's not like the epidemic that it really is something discussed like the epidemic [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5083.96s)]
*  Did you think that a lot of the governmental policies that were instituted stem from? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5088.92s)]
*  The fog of war during the pandemic and so it was driven by ignorance or do you are you of the view that? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5094.16s)]
*  There is kind of a doctor evil, you know nefarious thing behind this whole thing. I [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5101.16s)]
*  Am very reluctant to go with the doctor evil narrative [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5107.64s)]
*  I think I think there's certainly people that you would consider evil that will take advantage when things happen [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5110.84s)]
*  But if do I think that like they release the pandemic on purpose? No, no [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5118.0s)]
*  There's like pretty clear evidence that people working in the lab got sick and that those people spread it [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5122.38s)]
*  No, but let's say the the ad hoc policies that they would come up with you could only be four people on a boat [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5127.38s)]
*  You can do this. You can't do that. My my feeling is I don't have any proof of it [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5133.06s)]
*  It's just I'm speculating is that a lot of it really came from the fog of war people were and I'm not trying to be charitable [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5137.46s)]
*  But I think that most people were well-meaning. They didn't know what the hell they're talking about [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5143.54s)]
*  They they didn't exhibit any epistemic humility, right they they made it seem as though they knew what they're talking about [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5148.62s)]
*  But they were trying their best [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5154.22s)]
*  I don't think there was kind of this grand conspiracy where this is our chance to take over the freedoms that people still [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5155.66s)]
*  You know adhere to I would be more inclined to believe with what you're saying. Yeah, exactly [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5163.0199999999995s)]
*  I think I think it's many factors [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5166.86s)]
*  And I think when we want to look at like what why people did what they did [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5169.94s)]
*  We try to look at it one way or another I think there's many many things going on and also for sure [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5175.0599999999995s)]
*  governments that are [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5181.7s)]
*  really good at crafting laws that allow them to gain power and they've done that with the [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5183.9s)]
*  The all the the bills they passed after 9-eleven, you know the Patriot Act [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5191.62s)]
*  Yeah, you're back to the NDAA all that crazy shit [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5196.78s)]
*  They whenever something happens they find new ways to control and [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5200.38s)]
*  They do it because it's an opportunity. It's an opportunity to pass laws the people reluctant to pass before it happens [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5206.38s)]
*  Yeah happens all the time. It's normal. That's their job. That's what they do [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5212.4800000000005s)]
*  What they do is they're in control their power [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5216.780000000001s)]
*  Like that's the game that they're playing the game that you're playing is I want to keep my freedom [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5219.02s)]
*  right and like we have to figure out a way to like [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5223.02s)]
*  Establish like real clear rules to how this game works [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5226.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5229.0s)]
*  because if you could just cheat and lie and then delete things off social media and [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5229.32s)]
*  Have a bunch of bots saying a bunch of shit to stir people up and you're literally funding this [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5233.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5239.5599999999995s)]
*  like who's doing that is how many of that how many of them are coming from America itself and how many of them are coming from [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5240.04s)]
*  Foreign agents who are trying to disrupt American politics and trying to disrupt American narratives [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5246.16s)]
*  I wonder I wonder like what is the ratio of [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5252.36s)]
*  Shit post like people that are like, what would you call it? Bot posting? What was what's the level of disingenuous? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5256.44s)]
*  non-human non [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5264.16s)]
*  Non-real person posting as relating to kovat or anything anything. I think it's all the social things that are that are coming up right now [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5266.16s)]
*  Anything you see a lot of these wacky fake accounts [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5274.719999999999s)]
*  Like I wonder how many of them are they there was an FBI analyst that said that somewhat he believed there's somewhere around [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5278.46s)]
*  80 what do you say 80% he said 80% 80% of Twitter's users or bots. It could be as high as 80% Wow [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5284.26s)]
*  That's crazy what yeah, you imagine Twitter just becomes bots arguing with bots and they finally realize like no one's on it, but [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5294.02s)]
*  I have you felt that your I mean your experience with Twitter has [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5303.66s)]
*  Radically changed as a function of the pre and post Elon Musk coming in or hasn't changed much you feel more free [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5308.62s)]
*  Yeah, like you can post things that are controversial and not worry about you know having your account limited [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5315.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because if you were posting things about like first of all [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5321.799999999999s)]
*  There's things you couldn't post like you would not post a story about the hunter-biden laptop [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5325.7s)]
*  You couldn't even send it to me in a DM. Yeah, there were certain things [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5329.34s)]
*  I tried to send people in DMS and it wouldn't allow me to send them. That's amazing. This is wild [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5333.22s)]
*  This is weird. It's just [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5338.22s)]
*  Confusing it's like why would you think this is a good idea? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5340.74s)]
*  Well, I remember I had been contacted by I don't know if you've had him on the show [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5343.74s)]
*  Do you know Matt Ridley is Matt Ridley? [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5347.9800000000005s)]
*  Why do I know that he's a he's an evolutionary biologist? He was in the House of Lords in Britain [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5350.5s)]
*  He's been on my show a few times. He wrote a book a few years ago with a co-author [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5354.52s)]
*  I can't remember her name where they were arguing for the lab leak theory [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5357.86s)]
*  And and when he had when his people had reached out to me to come on the show [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5361.94s)]
*  I very frankly said look, I'm someone who very much speaks my mind [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5366.58s)]
*  I don't care but let's be pragmatic about this if you come on my show and [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5370.839999999999s)]
*  We spend an hour and a half chatting. It's going to be taken down [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5375.339999999999s)]
*  This was at the time when YouTube did not allow that and I've always kind of struggled with that decision because I was being [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5379.0599999999995s)]
*  Pragmatic and saying look we're just gonna waste our time. First of all, it's not going to appear [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5385.9800000000005s)]
*  They're gonna take it down [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5390.68s)]
*  They're probably gonna put a strike on my channel if not remove my channel and there is a real problem with that [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5391.88s)]
*  And so we ended up never doing the show [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5398.14s)]
*  But just the fact that they can get to me someone who really defines his identity as being irreverent and I just do whatever I want [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5400.22s)]
*  Yet they still found a way to get me to modulate my behavior to think about it. Therefore they won against me [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5407.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's self censorship that people do out of survival. Yeah, and it [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5413.62s)]
*  It always sat badly with me because you know, I always thought no matter what I'm always going to speak my mind [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5418.9s)]
*  But here was a case where I actually fell prey to that [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5425.24s)]
*  What's crazy is though also the goals shift the goalpost shift. So I think you could talk about a lab leak theory now [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5428.8s)]
*  Yeah, because it's kind of established science. Mm-hmm [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5434.96s)]
*  And there's more evidence that points to the fact that it leaked from a lab than there's there's almost no evidence of natural [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5437.5199999999995s)]
*  Spillover there's also evidence of manipulation of the the virus itself to make it more [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5443.58s)]
*  More contagious to human beings. It's some real wackiness man. Yeah, it's it's really it's crazy [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5448.64s)]
*  How but it took so long for people to think that that could even be a possibility [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5455.7s)]
*  Like remember when John Stewart was on the Colbert show and Colbert kept trying to block him from joking around about it [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5460.66s)]
*  No, I don't I don't know. I didn't see oh my god. You never see you have to see this [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5466.32s)]
*  It's kind of amazing because John Stewart bless his heart he sticks to the bit [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5470.46s)]
*  Yeah, and it Colbert likes trying to cock block the joke. He's not he's trying to stop him from ranting [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5474.58s)]
*  So you can clearly see John Stewart is in the middle of a bit [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5480.7s)]
*  He's like literally doing it to the audience like he's doing a bit like watch watch this. It's it's pretty fun [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5483.78s)]
*  This is a delight to have you here my oh my god, there's nothing I wanted to do more than breathe everyone's air [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5489.78s)]
*  Here's the thing [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5497.28s)]
*  This is what I know about you is what I know about you. We are we are truly dear friends [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5499.28s)]
*  And yet this is the first time I've seen you in the flesh in 15 minutes [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5503.679999999999s)]
*  That is that is that is correct, right? [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5506.48s)]
*  And I am so glad you're here and I'm so glad you're here and I'm so glad you're here [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5508.48s)]
*  I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5511.679999999999s)]
*  I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5513.679999999999s)]
*  I'm so glad you're here [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5515.679999999999s)]
*  That is correct, right and I am so really happy [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5517.780000000001s)]
*  And I know we're all vaccinated and I'm not gonna get COVID but I'm gonna get something [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5523.860000000001s)]
*  Honestly these people did not take good care of themselves during the pandemic [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5531.1s)]
*  last time well actually the first time we talked during [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5535.26s)]
*  Covid I was still in South Carolina and [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5539.46s)]
*  That's right you were locked down I was locked down down there and the family Evie and the kids were the actual crew [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5542.28s)]
*  That's right. That's how we were doing it [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5548.48s)]
*  We're doing it in a little unused little bedroom with cables through the window and that's right a satellite truck on our lawn [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5550.639999999999s)]
*  And I mean like the room was twice the size of this desk [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5556.2s)]
*  I think I'm not joking Chris could tell you it's really really tiny [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5560.12s)]
*  But the whole the point was like just to get it done to get something out there [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5563.04s)]
*  We really wanted to do the show and when I interviewed you for it [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5566.24s)]
*  You were talking about how little progress we've made in science in [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5569.780000000001s)]
*  Combating pandemics because in 1918 the advice was wear a mask wash your hands [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5575.26s)]
*  That's right, and a hundred years late a hundred and three years later [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5580.02s)]
*  Wear a mask wash your hands. It was so crushing to find that [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5583.46s)]
*  I was really hoping that like in 1918 they'd be like drink a tincture of mercury and butterfly juice like [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5586.06s)]
*  Like some bizarre thing. I'm like we've come a long way baby. It's the exact same. How do you feel about the science now? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5593.34s)]
*  So I will say this I [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5598.26s)]
*  But I and I honestly mean this I think we owe a great debt of gratitude [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5602.4400000000005s)]
*  To science science has in many ways helped ease [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5609.12s)]
*  the suffering of this pandemic [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5614.76s)]
*  Which was more than likely caused by science [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5619.56s)]
*  You'll be here and that's kind of [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5628.56s)]
*  Take [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5635.92s)]
*  What do you mean by do you mean like this perhaps there's a chance that this was created in a lab there's an investigation a chance [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5640.88s)]
*  Novel respiratory coronavirus overtaking Wuhan China, what do we do? [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5651.400000000001s)]
*  You know who we could ask the Wuhan novel respiratory coronavirus lab [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5658.26s)]
*  The disease is the same name as the lab [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5663.8s)]
*  That's just that's just a little too weird. Don't you think and then they asked those scientists? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5668.72s)]
*  They're like, how did this so wait a minute you work at the Wuhan [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5672.76s)]
*  Respiratory coronavirus lab. How did this happen? And they're like a pangolin kiss the turtle [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5676.68s)]
*  So [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5682.28s)]
*  When is this silly go bear the little cool bear cool bear keeps open his mouth [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5694.099999999999s)]
*  It's into my chili and now we all have corona [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5712.28s)]
*  See [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5720.32s)]
*  He has to stand up. Yeah [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5724.34s)]
*  Outbreak of chocolatey goodness near Hershey, Pennsylvania [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5727.08s)]
*  What do you think happened? Like oh, I don't know maybe a [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5731.46s)]
*  Steam shovel made it with a cocoa bean or it's the [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5735.54s)]
*  Chocolate factory [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5740.12s)]
*  Look at John Stewart, but you see how many times go bear [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5744.44s)]
*  But so this happened when this was uh [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5749.759999999999s)]
*  Look, they have the kovat 19 vaccine. Oh, that's right. Yeah [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5753.4s)]
*  Two years ago. So this is in the heart of everything. Yeah the chaos of it all [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5757.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know in in Montreal [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5762.48s)]
*  You probably know that we had some of the most authoritarian stuff on the covid we [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5765.52s)]
*  Late into the pandemic we there was a curfew that you weren't allowed to walk your dog in your neighborhood [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5770.4800000000005s)]
*  After you know 8 p.m [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5778.36s)]
*  Or 10 p.m [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5780.36s)]
*  What it was now people really there was an outcry so they rescinded it but just the fact that they did that [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5780.88s)]
*  I mean what what would be the scientific evidence that suggests that walking your dog outside in the super spreader event? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5787.18s)]
*  No, but I [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5794.26s)]
*  Genuinely think though and it's not I'm not someone who just gives people a pass to be charitable [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5796.099999999999s)]
*  I genuinely don't think it was something nefarious [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5801.3s)]
*  I think that it was just the fog of war people are acting like idiots thinking like they know what they're doing and they made [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5804.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm sure there's going to be a thousand doctoral dissertations written about the the failure of public policy [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5809.86s)]
*  Without it necessarily being a whole evil orchestrated thing. That's my sense [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5816.38s)]
*  I think there's certainly a lot of that and then there's certainly a lot of people that [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5821.3s)]
*  Never really had the power to dictate what people can and can't do before like mayors and governors [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5825.74s)]
*  They really didn't have the ability to shut down businesses [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5831.42s)]
*  Yeah [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5833.56s)]
*  And I think something there's something creepy and weird about having that ability [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5833.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and that people especially if their income doesn't change at all [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5839.26s)]
*  Yeah [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5843.38s)]
*  They did not seem to have a problem doing unscientific things that stop people from making money [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5843.7s)]
*  Like shutting down outdoor dining that didn't make any sense and they did it and they did it for optics [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5849.62s)]
*  Yeah, and the fact that that that kind of stuff can happen like it's when you when you get [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5854.9400000000005s)]
*  It gets real strange when people have power to do things because some people are just going to start doing those things [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5861.74s)]
*  You know, there's a there's an interesting conversation to be had about what's going on in Canada right now with [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5868.9800000000005s)]
*  assisted suicide, you know [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5875.38s)]
*  Because all you have to do is go to a doctor I believe the doctor recommends it and then one other doctor has to recommend it [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5877.66s)]
*  So I don't know the the specific let's find out what the specific mechanisms are [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5884.62s)]
*  but [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5889.86s)]
*  You know people that are depressed are [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5891.5s)]
*  Getting this as an option [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5894.18s)]
*  2021 the law was changed to include that those are serious and chronic physical conditions [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5897.18s)]
*  Even if that condition was non life-threatening [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5901.14s)]
*  It's been available for adults since 2016 [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5904.02s)]
*  Okay, so and to since 2016 Canada's medical assistance in dying program known by the acronym made [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5908.14s)]
*  Has been available for adults with terminal illness [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5914.860000000001s)]
*  Okay [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5917.26s)]
*  And in 2021 the law was changed to include those with serious and chronic physical conditions [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5917.780000000001s)]
*  Even if that condition was non life-threatening what would constitute that if I have severe back pain, yeah that fit under that [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5922.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you could well, I think [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5928.68s)]
*  Even depression I think is an illness. Yeah, it's considered an illness, you know, right? Yeah [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5930.72s)]
*  so if someone could like [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5937.320000000001s)]
*  Instead of discouraging people instead of saying, you know [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5940.400000000001s)]
*  Having a suicide hotline instead of like having people that have nowhere to go somewhere [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5943.320000000001s)]
*  They can reach out and find help instead of that. You're saying okay, we'll help you kill yourself [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5947.88s)]
*  Like that is that's a weird one, man [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5951.8s)]
*  That's a weird one to get behind because I'm all for people that have terminal illnesses and don't want to say [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5954.56s)]
*  I mean we do it to our dogs, right? Our dog is dying. We have the dog put down [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5959.24s)]
*  It's it's a humane way to take care of something that you love and care for you don't want I went through that five years [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5964.599999999999s)]

*  How's your I see some nice photos is good. He's doing well sweetest [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5975.28s)]
*  Well, you know in Canada [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5980.32s)]
*  There are all sorts of problems we're facing and I don't know if you heard about the story of the guy who just committed suicide [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5982.12s)]
*  Because he was being bullied by the diversity inclusion equity [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5988.2s)]
*  Have you heard about this? No, I didn't hear about this one a 60 year old man who from everything that I've heard [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5991.5599999999995s)]
*  It was an exemplary principle [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=5997.44s)]
*  He had been told that he has to take some you know [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6001.12s)]
*  Diversity inclusion equity stuff and in one of those meetings like that all the exact details [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6003.719999999999s)]
*  But he had sort of raised some concerns shouldn't we be judging people based on you know? [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6008.24s)]
*  Meritocratic ethos and so on because he said that but he's actually quite a liberal person from what I have heard [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6013.84s)]
*  But just the fact that he questioned the die cult the diversity inclusion equity. They started hounding him harassing him [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6020.12s)]
*  He's a racist. He's got to take you know remedial courses sensitivity. He ended up committing suicide. I'm sure [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6028.12s)]
*  Jamie you can pull it up just recently in the last week or two [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6035.599999999999s)]
*  Jordan Peterson wrote something about [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6040.08s)]
*  Cancellation that's kinder being diagnosed with like a terminal illness. Yeah. Yeah, well [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6042.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean horrible illness. I forget what he said, but you know what what a [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6051.4s)]
*  Lot of people have tried to cancel me now some sometimes people say oh, it's because you're tenured that you know [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6056.72s)]
*  You can be courageous because otherwise you wouldn't be courageous the reality is I get tons of death threats [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6061.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean last year I received for the first time ever a in person death threat while walking with my son [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6066.2s)]
*  necessitating that the [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6072.48s)]
*  Montreal police get involved so there are many ways by which people can try to get you to modulate what you say and so on [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6074.16s)]
*  It's a real problem [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6080.36s)]
*  What is the number one thing that people are upset at you about? [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6082.04s)]
*  Probably and I haven't done it in a while just because I kind of lost interest [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6086.84s)]
*  Probably the most violent would be any criticism of Islam [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6090.88s)]
*  and in this case it was I think someone who was of that faith because he looked like [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6095.24s)]
*  He came from that background and so [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6101.04s)]
*  people will get upset at me for all sorts of things Valerie Bertonelli got upset at me once because I tweeted something about my [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6104.28s)]
*  Wife having an uncomfortable interaction with someone a barista who was transgender and she got super upset and two days later [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6109.92s)]
*  26 million tweets later all the as [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6117.679999999999s)]
*  They've she put on the alphabet people were really coming after me [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6120.719999999999s)]
*  But that doesn't have the timber of you know, we want to kill you when you start criticizing [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6123.679999999999s)]
*  Some Islamic stuff then it can get pretty hairy [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6130.44s)]
*  And I think that's one of the things that's maybe different about say Jordan and me [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6134.799999999999s)]
*  I think he he receives a lot more [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6139.339999999999s)]
*  Hate than I do but some of the hate that I receive is really unique in that [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6142.36s)]
*  It's both Jew related and he actually mentioned this recently that you know [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6147.0s)]
*  I I'm in a unique but unique position in that I receive a lot of hate that's related to my being Jewish [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6151.98s)]
*  So cover being Jewish and then criticizing some Islamic tenets [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6158.0s)]
*  So for example, I've seen at times when I've come on the show and we've talked about I remember one time [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6162.12s)]
*  I talked to you about the hatred of black dogs as [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6166.52s)]
*  Sanctioned by Muhammad himself and then all sorts of people started saying he's making this stuff up. It's bullshit [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6170.6s)]
*  Why don't you bring a real Islamic person on the show? You can just look it up [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6176.72s)]
*  I mean Jamie can now check it that there is within Islam a hatred for a black dog [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6181.2s)]
*  So even the most you know, is that a translation issue? Does does that? [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6187.04s)]
*  Mean the color black for sure. It's black dogs. Yes, specifically black dogs [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6192.88s)]
*  Now I think it comes from the fact I don't know the exact theological reason [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6198.44s)]
*  But I think that Muhammad himself had had a fear of black dogs [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6202.12s)]
*  And so he sang, you know, he sanctioned it as a kind of divine prescription [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6206.04s)]
*  It's not it couldn't possibly mean something else [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6210.36s)]
*  Meaning what? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6214.0s)]
*  the color black [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6216.0s)]
*  The alleged hadith which regards black dogs as evil has been rejected by the majority of Islamic scholars has fabricated [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6218.16s)]
*  Nevertheless Islamic scholars have tended to regard dogs saliva as impure. Yeah, so that okay that [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6224.92s)]
*  so just fabricated just well, but [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6232.5599999999995s)]
*  Pretty much anything that you say someone will say oh, it's fabricated [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6236.36s)]
*  So in [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6239.88s)]
*  Islam there's a thing called nejes which is like impure things, right? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6241.4s)]
*  So for example the kuffar the non-muslim is himself impure. Well urine is impure the dog saliva is impure [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6245.5199999999995s)]
*  So if you were to be licked by a dog or something [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6252.92s)]
*  Then you'd have to redo your your purity ritual before you pray because you've been touched by nejes by something that is impure [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6255.599999999999s)]
*  So there are many debates depending on the hadith as to whether something is authentic or not [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6263.48s)]
*  But there is certainly as Jamie just pulled out the fact that there is within certain [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6268.24s)]
*  Islamic thought that black dogs are uniquely bad [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6274.679999999999s)]
*  And so just if I say that on your show there'll be some Islamic guy who says [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6278.08s)]
*  You know the Jew is making this stuff up and so on and so it's now [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6283.5199999999995s)]
*  I've stayed away from it recently not because I'm trying to shy away from it [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6288.679999999999s)]
*  Just because I've said all that I have to say about the matter and I've moved on [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6292.7s)]
*  But the hatred comes from all forms I can criticize feminism [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6297.599999999999s)]
*  I'll get women's group attacking me if I attack something about transgender issues [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6301.12s)]
*  I'll get criticized and so the the hate is endless [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6305.48s)]
*  That's a horrible thing to experience [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6312.8s)]
*  It's a horrible thing to experience [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6316.92s)]
*  Especially from a guy like you that literally fled it. Yeah. Yeah [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6319.72s)]
*  Well, I mean and and when I would for I think in our earlier chats many years ago [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6323.12s)]
*  We've talked about you know, Islamic immigration and so on and I hold zero hatred [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6328.5599999999995s)]
*  I think you know me enough to know that I mean I have tons of [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6334.44s)]
*  Muslim friends. I probably know more Muslim guys than most people will ever meet. I never criticize individuals. I criticize ideologies, right? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6338.599999999999s)]
*  So, you know does Islam codify the right of people to criticize Islam or not if you're in an Islamic country [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6346.28s)]
*  Well, the answer to that is very clear and the answer is not one that promotes freedom of speech me saying that [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6353.5199999999995s)]
*  Doesn't imply that I'm being hateful towards Muslims [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6360.24s)]
*  I'm just literally talking about the the Islamic doctrines just like there are [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6363.0s)]
*  Doctrines in Deuteronomy that we can you and I can decide to criticize right? [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6367.92s)]
*  And I think most Muslims even some of whom are students in my class who've heard me talk about these things not in a classroom [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6371.64s)]
*  setting but [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6378.72s)]
*  Public are very fair and they'll say, you know, you're a very fair guy [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6379.92s)]
*  You never but other ones will send me emails and stuff that are just brutal that are really and I have to say [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6383.68s)]
*  I'm someone who's if I can speak of myself quite courageous, but that in-person [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6391.6s)]
*  Threat that I received when I was walking with my son was really truly harrowing because I [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6395.64s)]
*  Could never rise to that threat right because the way that guy was speaking to me [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6402.72s)]
*  He always had more, you know [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6406.88s)]
*  I had more to lose than him and so there was never going to be a situation where if he decided to act on his [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6409.320000000001s)]
*  Hatred I could have ever lived up to that challenge. And so for several weeks [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6414.96s)]
*  I was really being careful going around, you know trying to avoid that street and it doesn't make sense that in the 21st century [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6419.780000000001s)]
*  A professor in Canada should have to worry about you know [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6426.200000000001s)]
*  Which street he walks on because some idiot is threatening him in front of his 10 year old son. It's incredible. Yeah [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6429.280000000001s)]
*  As is very terrifying when you think about rigid things that are in [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6435.160000000001s)]
*  certain religious doctrines [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6441.76s)]
*  What do you think the roots of some like the forbidden foods? Do you think the room? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6444.280000000001s)]
*  The roots were initially that those foods got people sick. Oh, yes [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6448.76s)]
*  Pandemics attached to I what a great question. Thank you in in the consuming instinct one of my earlier books 2011 [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6452.7s)]
*  I have a whole analysis of certain kosher laws [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6459.82s)]
*  From an evolutionary biological perspective and it's exactly what you just intimated. So pork it's all pork [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6464.139999999999s)]
*  right, so the idea so so imagine [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6470.82s)]
*  Ancient Jews walking around in an environment where there's no refrigeration [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6473.82s)]
*  where the the shellfish that might be [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6478.66s)]
*  Tainted with a particular [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6482.82s)]
*  Pathogen or not you can't smell it [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6485.0199999999995s)]
*  You can't see it all that you know is that some people ingested and drop dead and others don't there is no [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6487.7s)]
*  Mechanism by which I can learn the statistical regularities between a and b [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6494.54s)]
*  Therefore the only possible conclusion that I can come to is that it's a divine prohibition [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6499.0199999999995s)]
*  There must be some divine reason so even that [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6504.9s)]
*  Theological prescription I can analyze it from an evolutionary perspective now when I did that let's say for kosher laws [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6509.26s)]
*  I didn't get rabbis writing to me saying how dare you we're going to kill you for arguing that it's not divine if [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6516.5s)]
*  I do the exact same thing with some Islamic doctrine, you know, very respectfully very properly [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6523.46s)]
*  Most Muslims will hear it and say yeah fair enough professor's act [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6529.3s)]
*  But a few will say how dare you you should be killed [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6532.7s)]
*  Right and that makes no sense in a free society [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6536.18s)]
*  No, it doesn't and it doesn't mean that the root of any of these religious doctrines weren't from God himself [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6538.820000000001s)]
*  Like it doesn't like who knows [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6547.820000000001s)]
*  Who knows what the root of this stuff is but the root of? [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6550.900000000001s)]
*  most of them [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6555.54s)]
*  For sure has gone through people and the conversations have gone through people [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6557.660000000001s)]
*  It's like real clear in the Bible, especially in the New Testament we know the share that but [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6562.58s)]
*  The the origins of it is what's the most fascinating to me? [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6567.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's like where did it start from like what were the when the first guy wrote it down? [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6571.9400000000005s)]
*  Like especially when you're talking about ancient Christianity or whatever it was before it was even called Christianity [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6578.18s)]
*  You know when I was in Greece, I was with Brian Murorescu [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6585.22s)]
*  And he wrote this book about the illucidian mysteries called the immortality key [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6590.18s)]
*  It's an amazing book and in this book it all details these [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6595.34s)]
*  these rituals that they used to do and you know thousands of years ago where they were drinking wine that were laced with psychedelics and [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6600.099999999999s)]
*  coming up with democracy and like [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6607.78s)]
*  the [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6610.58s)]
*  the route when you're in those kind of [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6612.0199999999995s)]
*  environments when you're in a place that like used to be this like amazing [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6614.78s)]
*  Utopian society or at least [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6618.9400000000005s)]
*  Transformative society that never existed before and then you're walking around the ruins like I wonder if they saw it coming [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6622.22s)]
*  Right if they saw the end coming. Yeah, are we seeing the end? [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6628.18s)]
*  I hope not [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6633.3s)]
*  You know, I mean when you see like and you realize they built they built the Parthenon when you're there looking at that thing [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6635.46s)]
*  You're like, yeah, it's amazing. What did you do? Yeah, how did you do this? How did you do this? [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6641.860000000001s)]
*  2000 plus years ago and it's all designed with the golden ratio in mind. Yeah, it's [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6647.14s)]
*  Wild craftsmanship. I actually talk about in my current happiness book. I talk about different correlates with happiness [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6652.82s)]
*  How does personality correlate with happiness? How does culture correlate with happiness marriage and so on one of the sections? [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6660.5s)]
*  I talk about [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6668.6s)]
*  Religiosity and happiness are religious people on average happier and the answer turns out that there is a moderate positive correlation between [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6669.9s)]
*  religiosity and [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6678.94s)]
*  Happiness now that makes perfect sense in that religion provides me with [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6680.38s)]
*  Structure it provides me with greater communality [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6686.66s)]
*  It creates a nice demarcation between in group and out group. Therefore people in my in group I can cooperate with I have [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6689.139999999999s)]
*  So there are very functional earthly reasons for why if I am religious it's going to lead to greater happiness [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6696.58s)]
*  But what I try to also argue in the book is that that shouldn't cause people who are not [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6703.660000000001s)]
*  Religious to despair that they're not going to be as happy because I and I'm not sure what your religious views are [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6708.58s)]
*  But you know, I'm very much rooted in my Jewish identity, but in a cultural sense [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6714.900000000001s)]
*  I'm not very much of a believer, but I am very much someone who sees the divine in things [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6720.18s)]
*  Right my having a friendship with you being able to text you for me to come on the show is a [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6726.099999999999s)]
*  Divine thing my being able to bond with my Belgian shepherds in the way in this pure [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6732.139999999999s)]
*  Love is a divine thing meeting a random stranger with whom I have this fantastic conversation for 30 minutes is a [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6737.66s)]
*  Manifestation of the vine so I think we can be quite spiritual in our day to day without necessarily couching it in some [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6744.78s)]
*  Supernatural, you know religious narrative. What are your thoughts? [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6751.86s)]
*  I would agree with that, but I would also say that for a lot of people those religious narratives [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6754.9s)]
*  Are like a scaffolding. Yeah for which they can [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6761.299999999999s)]
*  Establish a better life. Yeah, and I meet a lot of people that are devoutly religious particularly devoutly Christian or devoutly Muslim [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6765.78s)]
*  That are very disciplined and live their life because of this like extreme belief [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6772.259999999999s)]
*  Live their life in a very distant often very successful way [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6777.46s)]
*  and I think there's a piece that they have in a [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6780.94s)]
*  True belief. There's a piece that you have that there's a God that's got a plan for this whole thing and [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6784.98s)]
*  Just worship that God and do the right thing and you're gonna be okay [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6792.139999999999s)]
*  But do you I mean suffer again from a purist perspective? I [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6796.9s)]
*  Think it's less impressive for me to do the right thing because otherwise there is a big guy who is who's judging me [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6801.9s)]
*  Than to do the right thing for no other reason than it being the right thing to do [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6810.099999999999s)]
*  I think the latter is a lot more impressive, right? [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6815.139999999999s)]
*  Did you agree? Sure, but the big guy is a part of you and you're judging you [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6818.0199999999995s)]
*  So you're not just doing something so that he doesn't judge you you're doing something so that you don't judge you fair enough [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6822.54s)]
*  So it's you are also God because you are also watching you do this thing [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6828.54s)]
*  Well, I've evolved a moral compass to use an evolutionary thing [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6832.98s)]
*  For social species that makes perfect sense for us to have evolved a distinction between right and wrong [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6837.46s)]
*  If you wrong me, there's going to be retribution. So we evolve that emotion. So I often get frustrated when religious people say [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6843.86s)]
*  Sure evolution explains a lot of things, but it can't explain morality. That's simply not true. There's a lot of very clear [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6851.78s)]
*  Evolutionary reasons for why a social species would have evolved a moral compass that makes sense [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6858.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's not something that exists outside of the purview of science and I think I mean there are several people [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6864.98s)]
*  I think that I've been on the show that have you know, Michael Shermer [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6871.5s)]
*  Sam Harris that have written about the fact that you know, the more [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6874.86s)]
*  The moral compass can is totally within the purview of science. It completely makes sense [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6879.62s)]
*  There's a moral compass and it also makes sense. You're talking about these divine moments [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6885.099999999999s)]
*  I think I think it's all these things and [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6888.459999999999s)]
*  Then some I think it's all these things and then some I think to just [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6892.54s)]
*  Sort of [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6900.179999999999s)]
*  Rationalize it down to survival instincts and and [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6903.0199999999995s)]
*  you know sort of having that [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6907.259999999999s)]
*  Dismissive reductionist view of what it means to be a person and have these experiences in life and what life is and I think [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6909.259999999999s)]
*  We're trying to label something that is almost impossible to believe is true [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6915.299999999999s)]
*  That I'm saying sounds with my mouth and you know what I'm thinking [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6920.36s)]
*  We're like sharing a context and language and we have all these words that are connected to very specific things that we're very aware of [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6924.9s)]
*  Meanwhile, we're hurling through infinity on an organic spaceship that's spinning a thousand miles an hour in a shooting gallery [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6932.36s)]
*  of asteroids and comets and [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6940.5199999999995s)]
*  This is all these things are true and we're finite life forms that are constantly innovating and trying to escape the boundaries of our [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6943.24s)]
*  eventual demise [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6950.639999999999s)]
*  physically [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6952.2s)]
*  psychologically, we're trying to connect each other on the internet and put chips in our brains and [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6953.5599999999995s)]
*  It's wild what's happening and in the middle of all this [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6958.72s)]
*  there's a battle a true battle in 2023 over censorship a real battle like the likes of which [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6963.32s)]
*  I've never seen because as a kid growing up there was no arguments against freedom of speech in America [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6970.32s)]
*  Right, I do not remember ever seeing someone argue against freedom of speech. It certainly wouldn't have been someone on the left [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6977.52s)]
*  Yeah, so good. Sorry. No, I'm saying just that that alone is [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6985.0s)]
*  It's a terrifying thing. It's like people are literally [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6990.4800000000005s)]
*  Crafting the shackles that are going to eventually contain them and they're they're doing so [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=6993.6s)]
*  greedily and and [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7000.160000000001s)]
*  enthusiastically, so can I offer a [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7002.88s)]
*  Philosophical explanation for why I think that's happening sure [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7005.56s)]
*  Some of your viewers may have heard me mention this elsewhere, but it's worth repeating [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7008.88s)]
*  So in in my last book in the pericetic mind, I talk about two ethical systems deontological ethics and consequentialist ethics [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7012.16s)]
*  Deontological ethics is an absolute statement [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7020.0s)]
*  For example, if I say it is never okay to lie [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7022.400000000001s)]
*  That is a deontological statement if I say it is okay to lie to spare someone's feelings [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7025.0s)]
*  The example that I often give is if your spouse asks you do I look fat in those jeans then put on your [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7031.0s)]
*  consequentialist hat really quickly [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7037.120000000001s)]
*  So for most things most most of us are going to be consequentialist [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7039.56s)]
*  But when it comes to certain fundamental principles that define say [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7043.4400000000005s)]
*  Western values those have to be deontological [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7048.04s)]
*  Yeah, right and so as to your point until very recently we all agreed that presumption of innocence [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7051.4400000000005s)]
*  was [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7059.160000000001s)]
*  a [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7060.6s)]
*  Deontological statement that can't have a but associated right you can't say I believe in presumption of innocence [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7061.8s)]
*  But not for Brett Kavanaugh [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7068.360000000001s)]
*  I believe in freedom of speech but not for Donald Trump [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7070.360000000001s)]
*  and so we one of the reasons why I've gotten into a beef with someone that we both know well is because that person has [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7074.400000000001s)]
*  repeatedly violated [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7081.96s)]
*  What he should know better which is that the ontological principles by definition should never have the but qualifier [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7084.0s)]
*  But now it has become perfectly. Okay when it when talking about freedom of speech to tackle it from a [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7090.4s)]
*  Consequentialist perspective don't criticize Islam because that means you're hurting people's feelings therefore shut your mouth [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7097.24s)]
*  Right. No, you can criticize Islam you can criticize Judaism. You can criticize evolution. You could do whatever [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7104.0s)]
*  There is no but right and I think if we can ever return to understanding the distinction between [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7110.04s)]
*  Deontological and consequentialist, I think we'll be back on the right track [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7117.0s)]
*  What do you think got us on the wrong track in the first place? [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7121.44s)]
*  So I think it's the distinction between reason and feelings [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7124.24s)]
*  We're both a reasoning animal and a thinking animal, but there's been now too much emphasis placed on [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7128.2s)]
*  Feeling feelings, right? [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7135.5599999999995s)]
*  So if I tell a truth that is hurtful to someone then I should not tell the truth [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7136.799999999999s)]
*  So I've often when I went in front of the Canadian Senate as the Jordan I [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7143.62s)]
*  For Bill C 16 the the transgender bill neither of us was arguing that transgender people shouldn't live with full dignity and so on [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7147.34s)]
*  But what we were arguing is that in the pursuit of that noble goal, you don't murder truth, right? [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7155.26s)]
*  So if I were to say it's insane for six foot four [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7162.18s)]
*  Biological males to walk into female spaces that makes no sense [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7167.7s)]
*  I'm not erasing transgender people right but if the [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7171.94s)]
*  Optimization metric is make sure to not hurt people's feelings. You start conflating these things. Yeah [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7177.139999999999s)]
*  Does that make sense? Yeah, but it's also [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7184.0599999999995s)]
*  There's no way to stop someone [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7188.179999999999s)]
*  From like if someone is a legitimate pervert [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7192.54s)]
*  And all they have to do is say they're a woman and now they can go to the woman's bathroom [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7197.139999999999s)]
*  There's no way to stop that. I'm not saying that that's the majority of people. I'm not I'm saying [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7200.62s)]
*  there are human beings that are like that and [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7205.34s)]
*  This does not in any way discount trans people [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7208.94s)]
*  This just says there's people that will game the system and there's no safeguards in place [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7212.66s)]
*  So if you want to protect people from that, I don't know how you would do it other than having some sort of security [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7218.86s)]
*  In each women's bathroom to make sure that no one's creeping on people which is outside impossible [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7226.179999999999s)]
*  You cannot have that well, I mean think about again the ontological principles until three minutes ago a [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7232.46s)]
*  117 billion people had existed that that's roughly the estimate of how many people have ever existed [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7239.299999999999s)]
*  Who fully understood that there were two phenotypes in the human species called male and female and nobody disagreed as to what that was [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7245.139999999999s)]
*  But suddenly now it is really controversial to argue that and that's why I do some of the satire and sarcasm on social media [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7253.599999999999s)]
*  It's not to be mean or flippant [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7261.36s)]
*  It's because the only way you can handle some of the lunacy we're saying is through derision through mockery because it's insane [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7262.96s)]
*  I mean, yeah, we we are the product of a hundred and seventeen billion people who exactly knew [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7269.08s)]
*  How coupling works but now we can no longer say it we when we refer to Leah Thomas the six foot four [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7275.12s)]
*  Swimmer we can't say that that's a male because that's a female because she said so it's insane [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7282.4s)]
*  It is insane and it's it's wild to watch. It's wild to watch young people just adopt it [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7289.16s)]
*  wholesale [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7295.44s)]
*  Because if you're a female athlete, it's not good. Well, I'm good [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7297.0s)]
*  It's unfair and I mean that's the exact idea right because people talk about it's unfair to this transgender athlete [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7302.12s)]
*  What about the unfairness to all of the biological females who are being screwed by this, right? [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7308.66s)]
*  Yeah, there was a woman who came on trigonometry recently and she had a very detailed [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7314.0599999999995s)]
*  depiction of all the different advantages that with even with a reduction of testosterone that the male frame has [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7319.099999999999s)]
*  Particularly in developing power power related things the shape of the hips the the the angle from the hips down to the knees [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7327.3s)]
*  Joe I've had [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7334.7s)]
*  conversations with [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7336.58s)]
*  Physicians not that you need a physician to confirm that there is male or female [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7338.34s)]
*  But how could you be a medical doctor and actually espouse some of the nonsense such as there are no sex [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7342.14s)]
*  differences between men and women I've had [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7349.820000000001s)]
*  anesthesiologist I've had [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7352.820000000001s)]
*  gynecologist who argued that [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7354.9800000000005s)]
*  Transgender medicine recognizes that the antiquated binary is no longer valid. That's insane [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7357.22s)]
*  How could you be a gynecologist and practice gynecology not knowing that maybe you're on ketamine I [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7362.78s)]
*  Don't know I don't know how things got this bonkers [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7370.98s)]
*  But I think that if you have a group where you can't question anything about it [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7374.94s)]
*  You're gonna have problems because then you have a protected group and crazy people can join that group and that that is a real factor [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7379.94s)]
*  We've seen it. It's a thing you see it with [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7388.099999999999s)]
*  These cases where these males with fully intact penises are wandering around women's locker rooms and women are freaking out and they're like [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7391.9400000000005s)]
*  No, I'm a woman and like what can you say if you see there's this thing that Matt Walsh did an interview with this guy [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7399.18s)]
*  He's a politician. Let me find this because it's so crazy. So this guy who is a [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7404.9800000000005s)]
*  biological male [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7411.78s)]
*  Here, I'll send you this Jimmy. I'll send you this this story behind it, but there's a video of him talking to Matt Walsh and [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7413.14s)]
*  On the documentary. No, it's not a documentary here [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7420.9800000000005s)]
*  so this guy [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7425.42s)]
*  Well, we'll pull up the story. So he is a biological male who has come out as a [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7427.1s)]
*  Woman of color who's a lesbian and he does it with all the it facetiously [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7434.42s)]
*  But he's doing it with a full straight face. Yeah, and the the way when you hear them talk [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7440.38s)]
*  It's yes, it's amazing because it's checkmate [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7447.02s)]
*  And they're saying if this was true, we would be clapping and applauding him, but we don't think it's true [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7451.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but this this like throws the whole thing find the actual [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7457.46s)]
*  Interview if you could online because it's amazing. Yeah, the way this guy does this guy deserves [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7464.5s)]
*  He should be in the next Tarantino movie [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7470.22s)]
*  He's an amazing actor [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7473.74s)]
*  But the way he lays it down is so perfect and he does it fully straight-faced and now they're saying if this was true [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7476.38s)]
*  We'll be a plat applauding him, but he's it's not true [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7483.54s)]
*  And so that's the problem with the whole thing [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7487.26s)]
*  You think in the deep recesses of all those folks his minds who come out as in support of men who have [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7490.66s)]
*  Penises are women. Do you think in the deep they know that it's bullshit or have they been so [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7497.14s)]
*  Peresitized that they actually believe their nonsense [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7502.0s)]
*  I think a lot of them believe it and I think a lot of them that belief is confirmed by their social groups [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7504.76s)]
*  Were who also not just believe it but enforce belief in it [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7510.4400000000005s)]
*  There's a social pressure to enforce belief in it and I've seen it. I've seen it in action [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7515.0s)]
*  I've seen women have arguments with people that are you know? [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7520.7s)]
*  pro trans rights and you know and these women are arguing that there's [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7524.360000000001s)]
*  There's pro trans rights and then there's a racing women's rights [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7529.959999999999s)]
*  Including like the athletic argument including the the female spaces like intimate spaces locker rooms bathrooms [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7533.28s)]
*  It's it's a very controversial subject in this strange culture we live in and it's [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7540.759999999999s)]
*  One thing that people can subscribe to one side or the other and find a group willingly vehemently opposed to their position [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7546.4s)]
*  So they get engaged in instantaneous conflict [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7553.4s)]
*  So they're involved in this psychic war with the competing ideologies and it gives a meaning [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7555.68s)]
*  That's a real problem with human beings [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7561.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7563.200000000001s)]
*  That we do attach ourselves to things even if those things don't involve you or your life you decide like this is the movement that [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7563.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm gonna get behind stand behind and I'm gonna tell you and it gives you meaning [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7570.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like you're a you're a social justice warrior for the rights of the disenfranchised [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7573.16s)]
*  You know and there's something to be said for actually doing that of course [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7577.88s)]
*  There's something to be said for actually standing up for people who don't have a voice and doing the right thing [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7581.3s)]
*  there is something to be said for that, but there's also something to be said for [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7585.4s)]
*  To be able to look at this from both sides and if you're an [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7589.599999999999s)]
*  11 year old girl and there's some guys dick in your face in the girls bathroom [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7593.28s)]

*  When someone's like so feminine and so so like seems like a woman [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7613.16s)]
*  You didn't have any problem with it, right? [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7618.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, I mean there is a normal distribution for example when it comes to you know [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7621.88s)]
*  Women who are very masculine men who are very feminine [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7627.48s)]
*  We've always recognized that right, but we've never taken the step into the abyss of infinite lunacy where we say [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7630.24s)]
*  sometimes [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7637.44s)]
*  Women can have penises [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7638.8s)]
*  I mean that's I mean and that's why I wrote the parasitic mind the last book right because I am I was really [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7640.6s)]

*  very unlikely [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7893.139999999999s)]
*  Statistically doesn't it no of course I mean already [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7895.0199999999995s)]
*  What are the odds so I think it's one in something like 10,000 that you have like full-blown gender dysphoria [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7898.46s)]
*  In the order of that magnitude so if you have two so it's two independent events [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7905.54s)]
*  So it's one out of ten thousand times one out of ten thousand. That's a very small [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7910.9s)]
*  Steelman this okay. Well, what's the most charitable? [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7915.26s)]
*  explanation for this [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7920.0599999999995s)]
*  That she why she's doing this why this is the case [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7922.58s)]
*  Why this is the case that she adopts two kids and that they're they turn out to be girls [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7926.0199999999995s)]
*  So I don't think it's a charitable explanation [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7929.74s)]
*  But I think it's the correct one and I talked about in the last book so I talked about Munchhausen syndrome by proxy [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7931.82s)]
*  So Munchhausen syndrome is when I fake an illness myself to garner sympathy and empathy [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7937.38s)]
*  Munchhausen syndrome by proxy is when I harm someone under my care to garner the empathy by proxy [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7942.78s)]
*  So it could be my child it could be my dog it could be my elderly parent [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7950.14s)]
*  and so I've argued that transgender ism as by as [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7955.18s)]
*  Exhibited by many of these progressive is a form of Munchhausen syndrome by proxy look at me the super progressive [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7959.7s)]
*  woman who's got two transgender kids, so it's a very very [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7966.38s)]
*  Diabolically narcissistic, I don't pretend to be psychoanalyzing her but you asked me for my prediction or opinion [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7971.26s)]
*  I think that's what it is. Yeah, I was trying to find is there an explanation that would makes like I would like to know [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7977.98s)]
*  Like what is what is someone who truly believes that that's normal? [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7983.9s)]
*  What do they think? [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7989.06s)]
*  Who believes that what is that? It's just normal that those two boys turned out to be girls [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7990.9s)]
*  It's people who live in La La Land because we know that statistically it's it's just impossible [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=7996.94s)]
*  It's like winning the lottery right but people do win the lottery, right? Yeah [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8001.78s)]
*  So what what would be your most charitable explanation? That would be the most charitable [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8006.82s)]
*  It's just it just turned out that these two ways these two boys [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8010.259999999999s)]
*  But there's still a lot of evidence that if you like especially with boys that exhibit that they turn out to be gay [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8013.7s)]
*  Yeah, feminine gay men. Yeah, which used to be fine [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8020.5s)]
*  Yeah, and now it's like, you know, like Tim Dillon has an argument about it that a lot of this is really homophobic [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8025.3s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. You know, yeah, I got that argument. Yeah, it's an interesting argument [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8031.780000000001s)]
*  The the the guy the progenitor of this kind of stuff is I don't know if you know him John money [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8036.18s)]
*  Do you know what that is? No, John money was a [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8041.64s)]
*  psychologist at Johns Hopkins University who's really the the the father of [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8045.02s)]
*  Social constructivism who argued basically that you know, you could take any boy and any girl raise them in the opposite [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8050.26s)]
*  You know gender role and then they would be that and the classic example which you may have heard of was David Reimer [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8058.38s)]
*  Whose penis was botched during a circumcision? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8065.34s)]
*  They put a dress on him said call him whatever Linda and then he ended up committing suicide [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8069.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, the guy who started all that was John money at Johns Hopkins and so we can really lay the [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8073.9s)]
*  Him as the original culprit because a lot of surgeons will go to John money for his expert advice [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8080.86s)]
*  Question about this story. Sorry. I saw this meme go around to this is where it came from right this picture [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8088.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, when I'm looking up the story about her adopting kids [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8093.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, all I'm seeing is that she had adopted one daughter and that in 2019 [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8097.9s)]
*  The other one said that she was not a boy and that she is a daughter also and so that they're both daughters [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8103.099999999999s)]
*  So so one of them is biological one is a real daughter [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8108.98s)]
*  I was trying to find out the actual I don't know that I come like digging through the stories. Nothing actually says [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8112.0199999999995s)]
*  Biological anything well, then I really appreciate Joe's your [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8118.78s)]
*  Your careful when you you know at the start you said I don't know if that's true or not [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8122.38s)]
*  Yeah, so that I turned out it's not that that's one of the reasons why I think a lot of people listen to you because [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8126.66s)]
*  Exactly of that careful thing. I mean you can get upset at it and you could also [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8133.46s)]
*  There's a lot of people that I know that will say their child is lbgtq because their child is they call themselves non-binary [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8138.18s)]
*  I've seen this happen before like people they wave it like a flag [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8145.9s)]
*  But it's like this amazing thing that they have a queer child. Yeah, and the kid is just like no, I'm just not [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8149.26s)]
*  Fucking nothing. I don't want to be this [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8155.82s)]
*  Whatever or they're just identifying as it because the identity thing is very new and when you give kids an opportunity [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8158.74s)]
*  To distinguish themselves from other people whether it's there's a lot of things that people do that with they they get into certain things [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8166.54s)]
*  They get into certain social groups. You know certain like hobbies and sports together [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8173.42s)]
*  But there was a thing that's that happened recently in where they just study in New Jersey [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8177.34s)]
*  They found out that there's a four thousand percent increase in kids calling themselves non-binary [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8180.86s)]
*  it's just like I [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8186.5s)]
*  Mean at what point in time do we examine whether or not social pressures are playing? [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8188.5s)]
*  That's the Lisa is at least a litman or Lisa litman [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8193.14s)]
*  She was a researcher at Brown University who argued for the the rapid onset of [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8196.74s)]
*  Transgender thing as a social contagion, and I don't know if you remember [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8204.82s)]
*  I talked about this in my last book at first Brown University, you know had put out all these you know [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8208.740000000002s)]
*  promotional alerts about you know [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8214.740000000002s)]
*  Here's one of our researcher publishing this great paper in a top journal and so on and then the transgender [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8216.34s)]
*  Activists came after her because how dare you be arguing that it's a social contagion that it's not a real thing [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8221.86s)]
*  and I'm not sure if they pulled the paper maybe Jamie can tell us but [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8227.220000000001s)]
*  She really I had I'd even invited her on my show to offer her a platform to you know to support her [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8231.900000000001s)]
*  And she had laid low because of the blowback she was getting well Abigail Schreier [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8238.1s)]
*  Tremendous amount of that and she was one of the first people to talk about it and when she talked about it on the podcast [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8244.019999999999s)]
*  I was I [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8248.939999999999s)]
*  Wasn't aware that it was that big of an issue, you know and that there's so many [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8251.699999999999s)]
*  particularly like young autistic girls that [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8255.779999999999s)]
*  dive into this and [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8259.939999999999s)]
*  That also there's a certain thing that happens when they start injecting [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8262.46s)]
*  Testosterone that it gives them this like feeling of euphoria [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8266.18s)]
*  You know and that it does alleviate some things like it has an effect [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8269.18s)]
*  Yeah, there's a physiological effect on and so they think this is what I've been missing my whole life [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8272.3s)]
*  Yeah, which is really kind of crazy to think that I [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8276.779999999999s)]
*  mean [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8280.82s)]
*  It's it's a weird things like this [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8282.22s)]
*  either [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8285.66s)]
*  especially when it comes to like encouraging surgery as [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8287.06s)]
*  Encouraging it for really young people are we when there when did we stop believing that young people are impressionable? [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8290.5s)]
*  When did we stop believing that young people should not make life-changing choices when they're really young? [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8297.58s)]
*  Because they don't know what the fuck is going on. Well, we've always said that with tattoos. We've always said that with you know [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8303.62s)]
*  body modifications and look at the cognitive inconsistency when it comes to age because if [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8310.42s)]
*  If a progressive will say that a 17 year old who's 17 years old 364 days [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8315.74s)]
*  So in one day, he's gonna be 18 [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8322.359999999999s)]
*  Who lies in wait kills his parents to pick up the insurance the progressive will argue? [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8324.74s)]
*  Well, you can't put him in prison for life. He's just a child [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8331.88s)]
*  His brain is still going to develop until he's 25. So for that issue from this side of my mouth [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8335.419999999998s)]
*  That he's too young but from this side of my mouth [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8341.82s)]
*  I'll say that a four-year-old is perfectly capable of saying I am in the opposite body and shut up [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8344.78s)]
*  Don't question it. Those two things can't go yeah [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8351.14s)]
*  Someone has to be a horrible monster for people to agree that this person needs to be tried as an adult, right? [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8353.74s)]
*  You know like some boy who stabs his whole family to death like crazy shit like that, right and which does happen [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8359.42s)]
*  I think there was a case of something like that [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8365.26s)]
*  Recently where kids stabbed his mother to death and they tried him as an adult. I think he stabbed a girl to death [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8367.300000000001s)]
*  Now I'm screwing it up. I think he stabbed a girl that he went to high school with to death and left her in the woods [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8373.34s)]
*  That's what it is. I think it's a bunch of those guys stabbed their parents. I just watched a [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8379.42s)]
*  Documentary on the dating show serial killer. Have you seen this guy? Do you know this story? No [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8384.98s)]
*  The dating show see Jamie. I'm sure he's gonna pull it out. It's a guy who was really diabolical [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8391.02s)]
*  I mean he was attacking eight-year-old girls. He was attacking 25 year old year was this this would be [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8396.7s)]
*  70s. Oh, yeah, we didn't talk about this once [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8403.94s)]
*  Yeah, then he appeared on it on the famous dating show where you know, a woman is interviewing three guys. That's guy [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8406.34s)]
*  That's the guy. Yes. I remember that I [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8412.980000000001s)]
*  Do remember that yeah, and it's funny because he won that show and then the woman [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8415.900000000001s)]
*  Decided not to go out with him because she found him creepy [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8423.58s)]
*  So she had the right antenna to pick up his creepiness [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8428.1s)]
*  Whereas other people didn't and paid so he was a serial killer [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8432.02s)]
*  He was a but but not just a serial killer job because he did not have a you know, a unique demographic group, right? [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8435.240000000002s)]
*  Typically serial killers will focus. I only go after boys. I only go after this guy had [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8441.7s)]
*  Was caught in the act of suffocating an eight-year-old girl and [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8447.74s)]
*  She didn't pass away and he was I think sexually assaulting her but he's also done it to 25 year old [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8453.28s)]
*  So this guy was now this is not the time now progressive will tell you that this guy is like that because something [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8458.58s)]
*  Happened in his background that made him that way. He couldn't have been born [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8465.06s)]
*  Damaged right? It's the social constructivist argument. We're all born empty slate and it's only society that either makes us good or bad [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8469.22s)]
*  Yeah, and therefore they would want to rehabilitate and by the way the the justice system released him several times [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8476.74s)]
*  When enough real the ontological world that guy would have been executed by the way [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8483.34s)]
*  I support the death penalty for guys like that. I [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8488.48s)]
*  Supported if the legal system was clear. Yeah, there's just too many people that get accused and we've had a bunch of them on [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8491.5s)]
*  They get accused of crimes that they didn't commit and spend decades in prison for murders and didn't commit [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8496.86s)]
*  I've actually had a guy on my show [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8502.76s)]
*  arguably the [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8506.08s)]
*  The most remarkable story I've ever heard on my show and I discuss it actually in my current book on happiness talking about gratitude [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8507.439999999999s)]
*  he spent 29 years in prison for a murder that he was eventually exonerated of [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8514.8s)]
*  On the show I asked him. How is it that you go about your life? You're so put together [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8521.0s)]
*  You're not full of vengefulness. You don't want to destroy the world. You must be Buddha [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8526.64s)]
*  You're a much better man than I am and his answer really speaks to the mindset of being a happy person and having gratitude [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8530.68s)]
*  He said well, I have a sister who's been bedridden with cerebral [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8537.48s)]
*  Palsy for much of her life and yet she manages to smile and be happy [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8541.68s)]
*  So I don't really have much to complain about [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8546.92s)]
*  So here's a guy who who has had three decades stolen from him and yet he still had the grace and dignity [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8549.119999999999s)]
*  I think we can all learn a lot from that lesson. Mmm [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8555.76s)]
*  Yeah, so that's why I have a hard time supporting the death penalty [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8558.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because I think there's a lot of like very corrupt prosecutors and a lot of very corrupt lawyers and [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8562.48s)]
*  The whole thing is it's it's human [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8570.36s)]
*  But couldn't we just restrict it to the most so if I find your DNA in the body of five dead children [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8573.56s)]
*  That's the only time I will [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8582.52s)]
*  Use the death penalty. Why not make it so that I can't do it? [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8585.08s)]
*  Make it so [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8588.52s)]
*  Extreme that your concern doesn't apply. I could agree with that [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8590.04s)]
*  I see it at least on paper that I could agree with that [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8594.84s)]
*  but the problem is people plant evidence and [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8598.24s)]
*  You know, it's you could see like if there's a video of someone in the act of doing something [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8601.28s)]
*  Especially now with deep fakes. That's a problem again, right? [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8607.12s)]
*  But yeah, if someone was especially if they're saying they're guilty they show no remorse [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8610.52s)]
*  Yeah, like why should they be alive? But I just wish that we knew for sure [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8616.4s)]
*  That everybody who's locked up in jail for a crime was actually guilty of that crime and that's not the case [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8622.32s)]
*  So that's not so there would be no context where you would ever sign up for the death penalty as it stands [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8628.72s)]
*  I just think you're giving people the kind of power for sure if someone does something we know they did it you want that [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8633.76s)]
*  Yeah, but it's a sort of it [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8640.68s)]
*  Akin to maybe the principles of free speech free speech applies even to people that you disagree with the Holocaust [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8643.48s)]
*  the nice right the the insane people Nazis like that was what the [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8651.599999999999s)]
*  The ADL used to support, right? I [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8657.199999999999s)]
*  think that if we were living in a world where there was no lies and [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8661.119999999999s)]
*  there there were the all the prosecutors and all the judges were all above board and and just [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8665.839999999998s)]
*  Impeccable sense of ethics and morals and you could trust them to know the truth then yeah [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8673.039999999999s)]
*  But that's not the case. Yeah, so in a flawed society like the one that we live in I can't support something [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8679.199999999999s)]
*  That's killing innocent people right even if it's killing guilty people, too [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8686.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's like if it kills ten guilty guys and one innocent guy. We fucked up [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8689.8s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that I don't know what the number is of people that are unjustly accused, but it's got to be high [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8695.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know and then there's people that are in jail for things that are very minor and then while in jail wind up killing [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8701.560000000001s)]
*  Somebody well, I mean to your point. I think the innocence project [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8708.560000000001s)]
*  Has demonstrated that there have been men who were on death row. Yes, honorate it [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8712.52s)]
*  So that speaks to your point many cases and my good friend Josh [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8717.52s)]
*  Duvin has worked with a lot of these different people and through the show a few of them have actually wind up being [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8721.28s)]
*  Exonerated Wow. Yeah [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8728.400000000001s)]
*  he's a [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8730.48s)]
*  Fascinating guy and he's dedicated himself to finding these cases and helping these people and he's gotten a bunch of them out and their [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8732.32s)]
*  stories are insane and [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8738.44s)]
*  Because of that because knowing that those exist. I can't support [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8741.0s)]
*  Something that's gonna possibly kill those people just doesn't [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8745.32s)]
*  There's just too much corruption. It's too much [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8749.8s)]
*  You can demonstrate the you could see it [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8753.119999999999s)]
*  There's cases after case of the case a prosecutor is getting arrested DA is getting arrested lawyers and [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8755.6s)]
*  It's too. There's too much fuckery. Yeah, it's a human issue, you know, and unless we knew that humans were telling the truth [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8762.519999999999s)]
*  You know you can't [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8770.039999999999s)]
*  It's just too it's too much of a and to do it [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8772.16s)]
*  Imagine if you're the person who executes this person then you find out that person was innocent like home [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8775.199999999999s)]
*  That's right. You got to live with that that person not only do you steal three decades of your life? [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8779.96s)]
*  But then you took their life [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8784.76s)]
*  That's the reason why and isn't it in firing squads when you have a whole bunch of people and they're exactly [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8787.04s)]
*  Yeah, but what about lethal injection? Yeah, there is someone who's literally doing knows what's going on there [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8793.56s)]
*  Yeah, you know we do it with a computer. Okay, whatever [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8798.76s)]
*  You know what you're doing. You know what you're doing. I mean you can find all sorts of ways to rationalize it [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8802.64s)]
*  Yeah [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8808.28s)]
*  But morally of course you'd want that person removed from society if you found you found out that someone in your community [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8809.12s)]
*  Back in the day in the tribal days was raping children. You'd want to kill them and justly so [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8815.12s)]
*  Yeah, we actually I was I can't remember who I actually yesterday I did [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8822.52s)]
*  The guys that came over at the hotel we were talking about [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8826.36s)]
*  you know [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8830.44s)]
*  parenting with the with the threat of [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8832.240000000002s)]
*  You know protecting your children from a pedophile and I've argued that my approach to parenting has been I don't trust [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8835.6s)]
*  anyone with my children [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8843.2s)]
*  Precisely because the one who is going to commit those infractions is not someone that has you know hidden horns that you can see [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8845.12s)]

*  There's no sleepaway camp because there is going to be this this the counselor there who is a pig and then I would have [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8874.8s)]

*  Them they have to like they have to be in the real world [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8901.68s)]
*  They have to experience different kinds of people and to protect them too much is actually damaging to their development [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8904.800000000001s)]

*  I mean it's horrible to say that any bad experiences were good for you [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8920.8s)]

*  Adversity in your life. Oh, I completely how much adversity do you want to expose your children to and then there's the question of things like predators [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8929.56s)]
*  I've actually argued in in the happiness book. I argued that [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8936.4s)]
*  What I went through in the Lebanese Civil War [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8941.24s)]
*  Paradoxically makes me a happier person because anytime that I start whining about something that's pissing me off [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8944.48s)]
*  I can always pull back from my memory. I had the miracle of escaping the Middle East intact [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8951.52s)]
*  So what am I whining about? [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8958.52s)]
*  So you're exactly on point that the fact that I've gone through those horrors makes me the happier person I am today [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8960.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8966.48s)]

*  Appreciation and their perspective is very different [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8982.36s)]
*  They're also like people that come from comedies countries in particular. They are just so allergic to that horse shit [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8984.92s)]
*  Yeah, when they see it coming any Marxist ideology they see it coming. They're like fuck you. Yeah, fuck you [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=8991.24s)]

*  Like what the fuck are you signing up for? [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9007.800000000001s)]
*  but these idealistic kids that think that the world could be a better place with socialism if that we all just like no one should I [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9009.960000000001s)]
*  Saw this thing argued this guy argued online [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9017.92s)]
*  No one should ever be able to make a million dollars and that you should be [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9021.08s)]
*  Restricted to a certain amount of income that allows you to have a certain like you spit specify the certain size [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9027.08s)]
*  Apartment that you should be allowed in anything else is in excess amazing that it's you know [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9034.2s)]
*  An attack on the freedoms of others. It's like there's this fascinating [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9040.64s)]
*  Take down by this like, you know super progressive probably college kid. Well, I have these ideas [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9044.56s)]
*  I've seen it what so I think last year when I came on the show, I might have been right in the throes of [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9051.119999999999s)]
*  Having all my book royalties stolen from my last book from the tax authorities, right? [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9058.96s)]
*  And so I was really pissed about it [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9063.32s)]
*  And whenever I would post a tweet sort of condemning the parasitic taxation system [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9065.199999999999s)]
*  There would be people who would write to me with complete entitlement Canadians and saying well [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9071.0s)]
*  Why should you get to keep the money instead of you not being a selfish pig and sharing it with others? [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9077.4s)]
*  So my book royalties my thoughts my ideas my humor is not mine as a matter of fact in the according to the Canadian government [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9083.199999999999s)]
*  About 58 percent is owned by them [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9090.0s)]
*  But it really comes from having this idea inculcated in you which is that we should all have equality of outcomes [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9092.24s)]
*  It is a cancer and it is [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9099.08s)]
*  An affront to human meritocracy. It's unbelievable [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9101.96s)]
*  the argument against that would be that there's a certain reality to the way you were [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9106.4s)]
*  the the way you're living in this life and that you have [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9115.4s)]
*  Resources available and you have things available that other people don't have and it would be better if you had less and then the [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9121.68s)]
*  Balanced out so if you give a little bit more and then eventually bounce out the problem is it's not bouncing out [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9128.76s)]
*  The problem is like where's it? Where's the money going? [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9134.960000000001s)]
*  Well, the money is going to the government and they get to decide how it's spent and they get to pass laws and [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9138.36s)]
*  Dictate and send a little here. Well, there's a war so we're gonna need more and then there's inflation [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9144.6s)]
*  This comes with the war. Yes, the price of gas and food and everything goes up and all this is happening [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9149.2s)]
*  And you can't say shit about it, yeah, and you're in this position where you're like, well if you complain [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9154.52s)]
*  Well, you're a man of privilege [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9161.720000000001s)]
*  You're privileged and you should be giving that up. And if you gave it up the world be a better place. I [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9163.560000000001s)]
*  Don't have any faith in their ability to use my taxes to make the world a better place [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9169.36s)]
*  I have zero faith [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9176.68s)]
*  I willingly and happily pay my taxes because I think it's part of being an American [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9177.6s)]
*  You contribute even if the system is flawed you contribute to at least some of it is going to fixing roads [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9182.560000000001s)]
*  And some of it is going to you know education and health care or whatever [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9188.640000000001s)]
*  Whatever it is the some of it's got to be going to people that care and are really trying to make the world a better [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9193.36s)]
*  Place some of it. You got to be going to [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9198.2s)]
*  whatever [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9201.28s)]
*  whatever [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9202.6s)]
*  organizations that are doing a good job, but [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9203.640000000001s)]
*  The idea that if you just keep like some people think they should have a 90% tax bracket [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9207.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's like if you're a billionaire, you don't deserve to have a billion. You should just give up [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9212.28s)]
*  Well, guess what? They're not gonna work. Yeah, exactly people gonna get upset then they're not gonna innovate [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9215.400000000001s)]
*  You don't have a quality of effort. There's a lot of equality when people talk about equality [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9220.28s)]
*  There's not an equality of effort. There's not a quality of intelligence [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9225.68s)]
*  There's not a quality of skill of talent and it's genuinely anti human nature [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9228.68s)]
*  And I I'm not sure if I've said this before on this show [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9233.76s)]
*  But EO Wilson the famous Harvard biologist who he's passed away now last year, I think [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9236.12s)]
*  He studied social ants and in social ants everybody is equal other than the reproductive queen [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9243.04s)]
*  So when he was asked about socialism slash communism his answer which I love to always quote was great idea wrong species [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9248.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right, which perfectly captures right? We're not all equal [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9256.6s)]
*  Some of us are taller shorter harder working less harder working [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9260.36s)]
*  So there is no reason why we should all have the quality of outcomes it is anti human nature just it's not realistic [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9263.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's not realistic to expect people to work as hard as some people. You don't they don't have to you know [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9270.400000000001s)]

*  You don't have to be Michael Jordan [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9280.0s)]
*  Like if you you're happy as being a guy who works a job and likes to go hiking and likes to go fishing or something [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9281.24s)]
*  That's great. There's nothing wrong with that [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9287.2s)]
*  But there's all kinds of people and some people are gonna be that guy [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9288.88s)]
*  Yeah, and when they are that guy like you can't say you have to give up all your money [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9293.72s)]
*  It's hard to be that it's hard to be Michael Jordan. He deserves all that money [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9297.8s)]
*  It's fucking impossible to be only one guy pulled it off and you deserve all the money you make my friend [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9301.039999999999s)]

*  What do you use your trust fund money for I would use it to be able to use as escape velocity [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9317.76s)]
*  So that I don't have to answer to anybody have you [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9324.52s)]
*  Because of the oppressive nature of the Canadian government if you ever thought about jumping ship. Oh my god [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9328.68s)]
*  I think we've discussed in the past. I think about it probably 30 times a day Wow [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9333.400000000001s)]
*  I haven't been able to for two main reasons Joe number one both my family and my wife's family are in Montreal [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9337.04s)]

*  Number two it's very very hard to walk away from a tenured professorship [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9346.08s)]

*  I've heard you say that before but that's spoken from a guy who's lived in Southern, California and then Austin for too many years [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9359.84s)]

*  Appreciations of the summer days because the summer days are they're enormously novel [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9408.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's like what a beautiful thing like we just six months ago [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9414.44s)]
*  We're just digging ourselves out to try to drive to the grocery store [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9418.36s)]
*  You know dig yourself out of three feet of fucking snow. That's true. Everybody remembers that well, and that's why Montreal [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9421.04s)]
*  It's there's kind of an orgiastic party feel during the summer [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9426.12s)]
*  Because we're making up for cocooning yes, I used to love doing comedy up there [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9430.28s)]
*  We do the Montreal Comedy Festival and it was in the summer and everybody was so happy. That's right [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9434.92s)]
*  And I I really clearly remember thinking that that there's something to the kind of character that comes out of people that live in that place [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9439.68s)]
*  It's not all of them. Of course, right? There's fuckheads at every corner of the world [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9447.300000000001s)]
*  But I just think there's something cool about that city and it's also like it's very European, you know, it's Canadian. It's a lot [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9451.44s)]
*  Thank you. You're making me feel good that I'm still there. I love it up there. It's a great place. It's great [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9459.12s)]
*  I just don't love the kind of direction that the government is trying to take control of the country [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9464.480000000001s)]
*  that's what freaks me out taking control of narratives and taking control of [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9470.92s)]
*  What people say on social media and stopping protests and what they did with the Canadian truckers? [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9475.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think and again to not to blow smoke up here behind [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9481.5s)]
*  But one of the things that I think people appreciate about you is that you do change your opinion in light of new evidence [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9485.92s)]
*  And I remember very vividly the the first time that you and I spoke about Justin Trudeau [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9491.839999999998s)]
*  You were quite a fan and then you revised your opinion [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9496.8s)]
*  Well, I felt I felt he's a very handsome man very good speaker, but he's not really a good speaker [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9499.859999999999s)]
*  On the cuff off the cuff. It's really like when he has like a speech. There's a template [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9505.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, he's a good-looking guy [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9510.48s)]
*  It's like when you see like a handsome fellow with nice hair [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9513.28s)]
*  It's like you know, it's funny that you say he's good-looking because Megan Kelly [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9515.94s)]
*  came on my show and [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9520.5s)]
*  Her view and you would we would think that you would know how to judge the masculinity of someone [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9522.36s)]
*  She said I would never want that guy on top of me. He doesn't do any message [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9527.98s)]
*  I mean literally almost exactly that to the word [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9532.08s)]
*  I'm sure that Jamie's gonna pull it up any second now, but that's also him now, right where you know who he really is [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9534.28s)]
*  I think is a girly girl. You think so? [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9540.48s)]
*  We had a boxing match hit a boxing match with some other politician. Do you ever see it? I did not terrible [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9543.48s)]
*  Yeah, not terrible. I mean I'll defer to your boss terrible through some hands, you know, it's all right. I'm going after it. Yeah [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9549.0s)]
*  but [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9557.359999999999s)]
*  What disturbs me is the way he's willing to discredit people that? [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9558.84s)]
*  Disagree with him like the Canadian truckers. Yeah, we saying that they're often [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9564.6s)]
*  Misogynistic and racist like like what are you talking about man? [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9568.24s)]
*  The fact that they froze the bank accounts of people who donated money that's insane insane. That's that's like Banana Republic shit [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9571.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's scary. Yeah, scary totalitarian shit. I had the [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9578.52s)]
*  spokesperson of the trucker convoy on my show [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9583.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's unbelievable. It's a test case. It really is. Yeah for totalitarian government tactics [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9587.52s)]
*  And they did not fail they did not pass that test they failed that and to the great discredit of my fellow Canadians. We've now [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9593.48s)]
*  Three times. I mean you you don't you don't vote for him [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9601.0s)]
*  You vote for the party and a parliamentary system [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9604.24s)]
*  But it's three times now that he's he's in and each time he's gotten I think no more than about 30 something percent of the vote [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9606.699999999999s)]
*  So that's one of the dangers of a parliamentary system, even though two-thirds of the people don't want you there [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9613.68s)]
*  He's now been prime minister since 2015. How does that work? [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9618.92s)]
*  Well, you're basically voting for the party and then depending on how many seats are taken in the in the Parliament [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9623.48s)]
*  That's who becomes the majority [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9630.88s)]
*  So it's not like the American system where I am voting for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9632.6s)]
*  You're voting for a platform in your riding, right? [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9638.32s)]
*  So if I'm voting for the Liberal Party, I'm voting for the liberal candidate in my riding [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9641.359999999999s)]
*  And now that is tallied up and since he's the prime minister the leader of that party [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9647.22s)]
*  He then becomes the prime minister and does anyone primary him? [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9653.04s)]
*  Do they have that sort of a situation where someone tries to challenge him from the same party only? [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9656.320000000002s)]
*  Only in the when you're deciding who's going to be the leader of the party [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9660.76s)]
*  So once someone's leader the party they no longer challenge that person. That's right [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9665.480000000001s)]
*  So I don't know the exact detail as long as that party is in power. He's in power. He's in power for how long? [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9670.04s)]
*  There is no I don't think there's a statute of not statute. What was it called the term of the term of the patients? [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9674.720000000001s)]
*  Thank you. I don't think there is he could be dictator forever for like the next 4,000 years. It's [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9680.52s)]
*  Yeah, great. One of the other reasons why I'd like to leave [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9685.52s)]
*  Canada and move to greener pastures. Yeah, it's just not good for people to have that kind of power [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9689.720000000001s)]
*  You know, it's almost never good and especially when they start using it in that way [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9694.960000000001s)]
*  They start, you know using it the way they're using it up there [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9699.76s)]
*  It's like the clamping down of free speech is never done by the good guys. Yeah, it's not it's not what it is [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9703.0s)]
*  and when you're you're being fed propaganda and you know, you're being fed propaganda and now you're expected to [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9709.88s)]
*  Not say it and not talk about it and just accept it. That's not good for anybody [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9716.839999999998s)]
*  That's not good friend [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9722.08s)]
*  It's only good for the people that are in power and it's only good [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9723.08s)]
*  For as long as they're alive because what they're gonna leave behind is gonna be a disaster and if new people that are from the opposing [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9725.56s)]
*  Party that get into control they're gonna expand their control even further and this is a terrible cycle that if you don't have very rigid [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9731.119999999999s)]
*  Rules on what can and can't be done you open the door for tyranny and that's that's what they're doing [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9737.44s)]
*  And the worst part is that it's cloaked under the robe of progressivism [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9744.0s)]
*  It says he'll be prime minister until 2025 they brokered a deal. What does it say at the top? [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9747.8s)]
*  It says they broke it a deal that will keep minority government in power until the next election. Yeah, why they say minority government [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9754.359999999999s)]
*  What does that mean so that means minority liberal government is that that's the minority of the people in this in the country [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9761.6s)]
*  No, it's in terms of the number of seats in the Parliament [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9769.2s)]
*  I don't know the exact number but you could either be a majority government or a minority government [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9773.32s)]
*  Usually when you're a minority government, it's because you've you've set up an agreement with another party allowing you to [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9777.52s)]
*  Right. So in this case, it's the NDP. So the whole party is behind him, which is a problem. Yeah, and that's [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9784.12s)]
*  What would it take for someone from another party to win [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9790.0s)]
*  Get in enough seats in the writings to overturn this asshole [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9796.48s)]
*  Right now the top guy in the conservative party is Pierre [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9801.8s)]
*  Polievre, I don't know if you've heard of him. I have I think Jordan Peterson had him on his show [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9805.96s)]
*  I'm not a huge fan. I don't know enough about his policy. So I don't want to misspeak but I [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9811.8s)]
*  Traditionally, I don't like someone who spent their entire career in politics and nothing else [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9816.48s)]
*  I like the guys who you know [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9821.439999999999s)]
*  They were surgeons or they were lawyers or they were businessmen and then they come into politics as a second act to their lives [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9823.8s)]
*  Whereas this guy meaning the Pierre guy has always been in politics [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9830.76s)]
*  And so for that reason alone, I would prefer someone to be coming in from the outside. But short of that [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9835.72s)]
*  I don't know anything about him [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9841.16s)]
*  Hmm [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9843.279999999999s)]
*  Just doesn't seem like it's moving in a good direction in terms of people's ability to express themselves indeed [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9845.48s)]
*  Yeah, it seems very very very much a thing that's in danger up there. You know, it's weird [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9851.24s)]
*  Yeah, well have you what what has Jordan been a support? I think he's a supporter of his right? Have you yeah Jordan is supportive [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9858.48s)]
*  of his yeah, I've watched some interviews with them. Well, there is another guy who [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9865.359999999999s)]
*  Broke from the Conservative Party named Maxime Bernier who started a new [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9868.72s)]
*  Party called it. I don't know what the people PPC or something [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9875.32s)]
*  I can't remember what it is, but it's very very hard to get it off the ground [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9879.48s)]
*  So I don't even think they got one person to sit in the Parliament [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9882.96s)]
*  Despite the fact that many of his positions we both probably you and I would agree with but it's just very hard to introduce a new party [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9887.8s)]
*  Yeah, so it's kind of [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9894.160000000002s)]
*  It's kind of how it is in America as well [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9896.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly like Cornell West just branched off and he's in another party right now, right? Oh, is that right party is he in? [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9898.400000000001s)]
*  Cornell West left the Democrats to run for president under another party [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9905.560000000001s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah as an independent or what did the Green Party? [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9910.720000000001s)]
*  Green Party. Yeah, so [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9915.480000000001s)]
*  That's interesting because there's a lot of people that are Cornell West supporters [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9917.800000000001s)]
*  That's interesting because there's a lot of people that are Cornell West supporters [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9920.6s)]
*  They're thinking would ordinarily vote for the Democrat or the Democrat is like there's blue no matter who people certain percentage in this country [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9923.52s)]
*  And there's many of those who might look at Cornell West and go you know what? [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9930.32s)]
*  I'm more aligned with what he's saying right and they might vote for him and it might you know [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9934.2s)]
*  Sway votes in one way or another they were very worried about that sort of like what Ross Perot did [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9939.04s)]
*  I was just gonna say exactly that yeah Ross Perot was like [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9943.460000000001s)]
*  conservative yeah [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9948.04s)]
*  But also 92 [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9949.6s)]
*  Yeah, it was when Clinton got in office [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9952.039999999999s)]
*  because [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9955.119999999999s)]
*  They thought you know Ross Perot was like he was saying he took out ads [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9956.92s)]
*  So this is what people don't understand [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9963.279999999999s)]
*  There was no way to get your word out back then [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9966.16s)]
*  It's so hard to imagine in this day of YouTube and the web if you grew up with it [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9969.22s)]
*  This is gonna sound so alien to you, but no one really understood how [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9974.3s)]
*  The IRS system worked or the Federal Reserve worked or any of these things work and Ross Perot [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9979.72s)]
*  Was so wealthy that he bought an hour of TV time yeah [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9985.119999999999s)]
*  So instead of like whatever would normally be on whatever channel he did it he he literally bought you know [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9989.56s)]
*  How much the cost about a whole fucking thing he was a Texas crazy billionaire dude and little dude [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=9995.359999999999s)]
*  I got a big card and I'll fuck you up, and he just didn't tolerate anybody's bullshit and this guy [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10002.84s)]
*  Laid out I forget what exactly he talked about [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10008.74s)]
*  But he laid it out of the way with charts and yes explaining to people like are you getting fucked yeah? [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10012.02s)]
*  And I remember the conversations that I would have the people I was working with back then were all sitting around [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10017.34s)]

*  But we also need to make our streets safe and we have to stop crime [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10248.16s)]
*  Okay, so we need to figure out a way to you know have these things [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10251.02s)]
*  You know mutually beneficial to everybody sure and there's no none of that. There's like more ridiculous laws [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10255.380000000001s)]

*  Texas is great and Austin is particularly great because it's a protective [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10281.9s)]
*  It's a progressive minded city that's surrounded by red states, right? Like there's a there's a t-shirt that says keep Austin weird and surrounded [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10285.42s)]
*  Something about being surrounded by the rest of like the real fucking Texas Texas people like even the progressives here are more reasonable [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10293.66s)]
*  so it's [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10301.939999999999s)]
*  Like whatever the chart is like where the middle is like there's so many people that you would even think of as [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10303.3s)]
*  Conservative or you think of as progressive because they're socially progressive or conservative [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10309.46s)]
*  But they're kind of more in the middle in terms of the way, California was right [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10313.66s)]
*  California was like radical leftism and then like if you were conservative you had to hide it or you're a Nazi or you live [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10318.779999999999s)]

*  but the [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10332.38s)]
*  Unwhelming amount of people who are in the the big urban areas like specifically San Francisco and Los Angeles they're in the fucking [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10334.42s)]

*  I'm worried that it's gonna turn worse like you could have never imagined when I used to go to San Francisco in the 90s [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10397.1s)]

*  It's a fucking hellhole how [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10446.5s)]
*  Ideologies have consequences. Well, San Francisco is a really good [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10449.82s)]
*  Documenting yeah Michael Schellenberg. I've had on the show. He's amazing [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10455.62s)]
*  He's amazing and Michael Schellenberger who used to you know loose used to be like a hardcore progressive [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10459.14s)]
*  Yeah, so he understands the mentality behind it and the sentiment behind he's like a super sweet kind guy [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10464.82s)]
*  He's a lovely guy. Yeah, and his book is amazing because it really documents and it's about how progressive ruin cities [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10470.22s)]
*  Yeah, and it uses San Francisco as an amazing example of it [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10476.5s)]
*  And it's unfortunate because I think these people all have the right intentions [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10480.82s)]
*  They a lot of them at least do they have good intentions [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10484.9s)]
*  They have this they think this ideology is a kinder more inclusive more gentle [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10487.8s)]
*  But the consequences of the way they're enacting laws and allowing people to ruin everything around them [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10492.38s)]
*  Like that is real financial consequences. Yeah in the parasitic mind [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10499.02s)]
*  I actually talk about the fact that all of those parasitic ideas start with a noble goal [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10503.800000000001s)]
*  Mmm, and then in the pursuit of that noble goal things go awry [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10509.56s)]

*  And do you even have the resources? Well, it's hard when you have a super majority like you do in California [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10524.04s)]
*  It's also hard when you have like it's very like it takes a long time to build a building [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10529.32s)]
*  You know, it's really easy to light it on fire. Yeah, it takes just a few minutes [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10536.24s)]
*  you know, just throw gasoline on throw a flake step away that fucking building is gone and [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10540.4s)]

*  I think it was on a lot of places. I think a lot of [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10790.720000000001s)]
*  Original one was he's saying that and with the fire. I'm mostly peaceful protest [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10794.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. That is the truth though [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10800.02s)]
*  But if you do light some buildings on fire and most of the people are not lighting buildings on fire [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10803.66s)]
*  It's mostly peaceful. Well, that's one of the things by the way that I think Canada we have better than you guys in that we are [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10808.880000000001s)]
*  less violent [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10815.86s)]
*  Like that with hockey [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10818.42s)]
*  There is no place in Montreal that you truly would be afraid to take a wrong turn [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10821.42s)]
*  Oh, well, that's nice. That's cuz the cold weeds weeds out the week [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10827.58s)]
*  They're cold weeds out the week up there [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10833.82s)]
*  I remember coming from Boston thinking how fucking cold it is up there like whoa. This is another level [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10835.94s)]
*  Another level like walking from my hotel to get something to eat [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10842.38s)]
*  I remember we walked a couple blocks more like this is an adventure [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10846.22s)]
*  Yeah, an adventure and not dying when you're walking to a restaurant like holy shit minus 40 [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10849.42s)]
*  yeah, and then when you get inside everyone's like holy shit, holy shit, but there's a [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10854.64s)]
*  warmth and [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10859.98s)]
*  Hospitality to like going to a place when it's warm inside and it's cold outside and everyone's very [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10861.42s)]
*  Appreciative of the warmth. Yeah, it's very different than going into a cool place when it's hot out [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10868.34s)]
*  Right going to a cool place when it's hot out. It's nice [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10873.82s)]
*  It's nice, but it doesn't feel the same nice as like you could fucking die out there. That's right [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10876.62s)]
*  I've by the way when I was 13 they had stopped school [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10882.02s)]
*  I think the only time ever because it was too cold [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10885.66s)]
*  Usually it's because it's too snowy and it was I think minus 70 with windchill [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10888.1s)]
*  Oh, and I decided to walk out just to to say as I am now that I did it [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10892.98s)]
*  Yeah, and I lasted maybe 10 meters [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10898.94s)]
*  It was your my face was burning so basically it was like playing football in the NFL you lasted about [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10901.54s)]
*  What a nice way to bring about same way you would walk out with a football [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10909.42s)]
*  God it gets so cold, but I mean, I don't think it's necessary to develop character, but I certainly think it helps [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10913.94s)]
*  Yeah, I felt that about Boston [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10919.74s)]
*  Like I love the people that live there because there's a certain like fucking roughness to those people [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10921.7s)]
*  They've dealt with some shit, you know, they know how to deal with some shit. What is your next visit to Montreal? I [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10927.220000000001s)]
*  Don't know. I've been to Canada since all this shit went down till I couldn't cross the border if I was unvaccinated [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10933.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean still was in America until May you couldn't come here that's true [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10943.34s)]
*  They were like the last country, you know to hang in there with that. Yeah [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10949.18s)]
*  Oh [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10953.14s)]
*  Weird just weird to be going through this [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10955.18s)]
*  Well, I remember the last time that at least that I knew that you came you were kindly invited me to one of your stand-up [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10958.22s)]
*  But the corona theater across from Joe beef. We're giving a lot of plugs [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10964.92s)]
*  Is your friend? Yeah. Yeah. Well the yeah both those guys there. Yeah, that's an incredible restaurant. It is [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10970.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was voter in the top restaurants in Canada. Yeah [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10976.939999999999s)]
*  Should be yeah, Montreal is just an amazing place for culture in general. It's just a beautiful city. It's great great old architecture [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10981.86s)]
*  It's just it's a lot of money. I'm feeling better by the second about being there. You're gonna live in Canada [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10989.14s)]
*  It's a great spot. It is it's a great spot much less cold much less antiseptic than Toronto. That's for sure. Yeah. Yeah, it's just um [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=10993.82s)]
*  you know [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11002.14s)]
*  those kind of the kind of policies that are in place that just [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11003.7s)]
*  That stop the freedom of expression [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11007.3s)]
*  They're they're troubling because I always thought of Canada as being like this really open-minded liberal place and incidentally [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11010.02s)]
*  There's a unique dynamic in Quebec that's different from Canada, which is the protection of the French language [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11015.58s)]
*  Mmm, and in doing that you do end up also infringing on people's intrinsic rights, right? So I'm fully francophone [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11021.619999999999s)]
*  So it's not as though I've got a I'm perfectly happy to speak French [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11028.14s)]
*  But you shouldn't have to mandate that by instituting draconian laws [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11031.699999999999s)]
*  So you get all sorts of immigrants that come to Quebec that you otherwise should want to have in Quebec [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11037.279999999999s)]
*  But because they can't pass some French tests they end up leaving. Is that really good for society? [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11042.019999999999s)]
*  but to question according to the Quebec government it is because [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11047.779999999999s)]
*  Quebec is a distinct society that's surrounded by evil, you know English language [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11051.859999999999s)]
*  And we need to do whatever we can to protect it in my view [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11057.339999999998s)]
*  You shouldn't it's it is fascinating that there's a segment of your country that speaks primarily French [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11061.18s)]
*  Amazing, isn't it? And by the way as as you leave Montreal it becomes almost exclusively French really and in Montreal [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11067.62s)]
*  Historically the more you went west it was more English the more you went east the more French it was [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11075.1s)]
*  But outside of Montreal [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11081.74s)]
*  20 25 30 40 minutes you could pretty much only speak French and you know Wow [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11084.1s)]
*  so [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11090.94s)]
*  Kind of cool cool to visit kind of cool. Come and see us. We miss you up there [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11092.42s)]
*  Well, you know, you gotta stay there and keep it down. Hold it down. You're one of the few reasonable voices from up there [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11097.9s)]
*  It's like yelling from the rooftops [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11105.460000000001s)]
*  And you've been at the front lines for a long time my friend you you were sounding out about the dangers of all this stuff [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11107.74s)]

*  This is weird that people have this perspective. Like don't they see that he's making so much sense. Yeah, it's so right [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11125.220000000001s)]
*  I mean everything you're saying is so rational and reasonable and well thought out like oh, he's a Nazi [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11130.7s)]
*  He's a Jewish Nazi who escaped Lebanon. What are you talking about? [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11135.820000000002s)]
*  Right, right [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11141.1s)]
*  It's it's weird where people try to categorize people and say and you in a lot of the ways because of who you are and [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11142.300000000001s)]

*  You have deep understanding of like where these problems come from like what's the source of them? [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11168.539999999999s)]
*  How do they arise and how do they permeate through society in this sort of as you say parasitic way? [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11173.22s)]
*  Thank you. Those are very sweet words. I really appreciate them. Yeah. Well, you're a very important voice [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkcmPc0DaQ&t=11179.539999999999s)]
