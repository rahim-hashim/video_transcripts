# Joe Rogan Experience #2290 - Michael Kosta
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5.72s)]
*  Yes sir, Michael. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=12.6s)]
*  Good to see you my friend. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=13.6s)]
*  Thanks for having me and really appreciate you showing me around. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=15.16s)]
*  Wow, what a space you've created, man. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=17.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=19.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=20.88s)]
*  That's so cool. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=21.88s)]
*  Keeps going. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=22.88s)]
*  I was excited to show you the picture of my sauna and then you show me you got an archery. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=23.88s)]
*  That's so cool, man. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  That's so cool. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=32.24s)]
*  We were just singing John Stewart's praises before this started, but I'm so happy he's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=33.24s)]
*  back at The Daily Show and I'm so happy he makes fun of everything and I'm so happy he [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=36.24s)]
*  still makes dick jokes. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=42.36s)]
*  The Daily Show seems like The Daily Show again. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=43.36s)]
*  That guy's a very unique dude, very unique person and one of the most important pieces [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=45.28s)]
*  to unify everybody. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  He's reasonable. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=53.24s)]
*  He gets the whole big picture. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=54.36s)]
*  Let's stop being so fucking ridiculously tribal. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=57.52s)]
*  In the morning meeting, he'll come in and we're all sitting there, the writers, and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=60.92s)]
*  he just kind of shuts the door behind him and we start talking. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=67.12s)]
*  It's like a conversation with a college professor, but he's in charge and it's beautiful. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=70.64s)]
*  All sides. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=77.12s)]
*  This. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=78.12s)]
*  I disagree with that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=79.12s)]
*  What about this? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=80.12s)]
*  It's really fun to be a part of. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=81.12s)]
*  Then someone will yell out a dick joke and then that joke will make it to the show too. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=83.2s)]
*  It's smart things and dumb things. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=86.36s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=88.48s)]
*  He's never abandoned being a real comic, which is what got him to the dance in the first [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=89.48s)]
*  place. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=93.4s)]
*  He always has those instincts. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=94.4s)]
*  He's the very best at holding a line and making something even more preposterous just with [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=97.28s)]
*  a facial expression and pointing out these fucking unbelievably ridiculous in-your-face [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=104.56s)]
*  hypocrisies that we see every day from both sides. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=111.28s)]
*  Yeah, from both sides. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  Have you ever done stand-up with him? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, we've done stuff together. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=117.0s)]
*  Back in the day, yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  I can't remember the last time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  I was supposed to do something with him at one of Dave's things that he was doing outside [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=123.48s)]
*  back in the day, but I never wound up doing it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=128.24s)]
*  I definitely did stand up with him in the clubs back in New York and I knew him way, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=130.68s)]
*  way back in the day. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=135.72s)]
*  He was on MTV. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=136.72s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=137.72s)]
*  I think I remember one of his books was called Naked Pictures of Famous People, which was [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=139.44s)]
*  great. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=146.12s)]
*  He's a solid guy. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=147.12s)]
*  He's a solid guy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=148.12s)]
*  I don't know if he's agree with him, but I don't always agree with everybody. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=149.68s)]
*  I don't even agree with me. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=151.84s)]
*  Isn't that good? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=152.84s)]
*  Isn't that the point of this? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=153.84s)]
*  It's like you want a couple people to be mad sometimes. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=155.68s)]
*  I also think we all as human beings need to be divorced from our ideas. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=158.0s)]
*  Your ideas are not you. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=162.76s)]
*  You are you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=164.76s)]
*  Ideas are things that you should consider. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=166.4s)]
*  Ideas are something that you should ... I mean, if it's going to have some sort of a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=169.28s)]
*  real physical impact on your life and your family and your families and the people you [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=172.56s)]
*  care about, I understand. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  I understand why you get connected to things like that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=177.32000000000002s)]
*  But for the most part, most of these ideas don't affect you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=179.72s)]
*  A lot of them don't. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  And yet we're so ideologically captured that we fight for these ideas as if it's our very [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  nature. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=191.24s)]
*  You're talking about your essence as a human being. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=192.24s)]
*  And it's stupid. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=195.28s)]
*  This reminds me of a time I left my joke book on a train in New York. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=196.96s)]
*  In the joke book I have, this book is important to me. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=203.36s)]
*  Call me if you get this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  And this guy texts me and he says, I have this joke book. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=208.96s)]
*  Talk about your ideas. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  The joke book is the most unfiltered dumb idea ever. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=214.08s)]
*  That's the beauty of it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=219.44s)]
*  And I said, man, I'm sure he's reading it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=221.52s)]
*  You're going to read it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=223.84s)]
*  You're going to read a stranger's joke book. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=225.72s)]
*  And I connected with him. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  He was very kind. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=228.42000000000002s)]
*  He gave it to me. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=229.42000000000002s)]
*  But he kind of looked at me like, are you a comedian type thing? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  And I said, yeah. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=232.86s)]
*  But it's terrifying when that idea gets attached to you when it was just a fleeting idea. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=233.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=240.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=241.56s)]
*  The joke book idea is the best example of that, right? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=242.56s)]
*  Because most of what you write is shit, which took me forever to figure out. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=244.58s)]
*  I was like, God, I just write shit. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=248.52s)]
*  And then every now and then a gem. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=250.6s)]
*  Like, ooh, and then you extract the gem. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=251.88s)]
*  And then I realized afterwards, it's basically like gold mining. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  Most of the time, you're not finding gold. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=257.48s)]
*  You're finding garbage. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=259.12s)]
*  And you only get to gold by going through garbage. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=260.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=263.36s)]
*  Sometimes I'll do a show and it's terrible. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=264.36s)]
*  New joke show. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=266.56s)]
*  But then the next day, the thing happens. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=267.88s)]
*  And I think, oh, that's because I was digging all day yesterday. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=269.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=273.88s)]
*  It's the muse. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=274.88s)]
*  You have to show up and request the muse's love. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=275.88s)]
*  I like that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, do you ever read Pressfield's War of Art? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=283.36s)]
*  It's really, we have a stack of them out there. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=284.36s)]
*  I'll give you a copy of it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=285.64s)]
*  It's a small book, easy read. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=286.64s)]
*  Jay Larson, comedian in LA, recommended that book to me 10 years ago. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=288.56s)]
*  And I never tackled it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  It's really good. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=294.44s)]
*  I used to have a stack of them in the studio where I'd give out to guests because so many [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=295.44s)]
*  comics, I was like, this is what you need. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=299.0s)]
*  What's the essence? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=301.0s)]
*  I will read it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=302.0s)]
*  Also, you know what keeps freaking me out? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=303.0s)]
*  There's a shooting star above my head. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=304.0s)]
*  Yes, there is. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=305.0s)]
*  Yeah, there is. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=306.0s)]
*  Every now and then one will fly above your head. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=307.0s)]
*  That's so cool. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=310.0s)]
*  What's the essence? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=311.0s)]
*  It's the war of art that makes it sound like it's a struggle to create art. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=312.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's the struggle against resistance, which is procrastination, which is this thing [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=315.88s)]

*  you're a professional and you have to decide at 8 a.m. I will show up and I will be there [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=350.52s)]
*  for three hours. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=355.24s)]

*  This is what I do because I am a professional and you literally make a prayer to the muse. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=358.64s)]
*  You offer yourself to the muse. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=365.08s)]
*  You say, I'm here to work. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=367.8s)]
*  I'm here to gather ideas. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=369.36s)]
*  I'm here to be creative and be open and you treat it that way. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=371.8s)]
*  Whether or not the muse is real or not, that's kind of, you can get hung up on that, but [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=375.44s)]
*  if you treat it like it's real, it works, which is really crazy. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=380.72s)]
*  I love that and I don't do that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=385.2s)]
*  Early in my comedy career, I would go to the coffee shop at this time and start typing [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=388.72s)]
*  and I have all these bits. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=394.1s)]
*  I remember Tommy at the comedy store. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=395.1s)]
*  He would say, every time I see you, you have new bits. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=396.6s)]

*  I get up pretty early for a comic. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=413.92s)]
*  I'm up by eight almost every day. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=416.44s)]

*  Right. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=420.84000000000003s)]

*  Either we're watching YouTube or I'm writing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=434.24s)]

*  You write by hand or you type? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=439.68s)]
*  No, I type. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=441.44s)]
*  You type? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=442.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=443.44s)]
*  I feel like I can't write fast enough by hand. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=444.44s)]
*  What I like about typing is that I don't have to look at the keys. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=446.92s)]

*  I can zone in to it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=456.88s)]
*  What I really like is a keyboard that I can feel. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=459.92s)]
*  I need travel in my keys. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=463.6s)]
*  These clickety-clickety-clickety little MacBook keys, those are bullshit. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=466.72s)]

*  where your finger sits. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=474.6s)]
*  I use a ThinkPad. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=475.6s)]
*  ThinkPads have the best keyboards. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=477.52s)]
*  They have travel. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=479.28s)]
*  Each one has a couple of millimeters of travel. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=480.28s)]
*  It's a clickety-clickety-clickety. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=482.96s)]
*  My fingers know exactly where to go and I can just get into the zone. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=484.64s)]
*  You're zoning right now. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=487.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=488.68s)]

*  It doesn't get email. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=498.8s)]

*  I take it out in the summer a lot. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=680.4599999999999s)]
*  In LA, that was what I used all the time. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=683.5s)]
*  You ride a motorcycle in LA? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=686.18s)]
*  I did forever. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=687.86s)]
*  Holy shit, dude. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=688.86s)]

*  And there it's deer, man. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=695.9s)]
*  That's the scary thing there. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=696.9s)]
*  They get very close. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=699.42s)]
*  They're not afraid of cars or motor vehicles at this point. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=700.42s)]
*  There's a time between September-ish to December-ish where they're retarded because they're horny. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=703.6999999999999s)]
*  Once it starts getting warm out, they start getting goofy. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=711.3399999999999s)]
*  When you get cold around November, that's when it really kicks in. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=714.3s)]
*  If you're in Pennsylvania or Iowa, oh my God, I visited my friend John in Iowa and [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=718.18s)]
*  I'm driving down the road and every 15 seconds you're slamming on your brakes because something's [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=722.78s)]
*  darting near the road. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=727.5s)]
*  They're all over the place. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=729.06s)]
*  So they're horny and looking. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=730.06s)]
*  They're also getting chased. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=732.02s)]
*  The bucks are chasing the females and the females are just running out into traffic. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=733.8199999999999s)]
*  And the bucks are falling on them. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=737.42s)]
*  Bang, bang. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=738.74s)]
*  I saw men at night. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=740.1800000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=742.1800000000001s)]
*  Sixth Street. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=743.1800000000001s)]
*  Where my club is. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=744.1800000000001s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=745.1800000000001s)]
*  Don't drive fast. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=746.1800000000001s)]
*  That's why the road is closed on the weekends. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=747.1800000000001s)]
*  They don't want people driving down Sixth Street with all these horny idiots. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=749.1800000000001s)]
*  I love that they closed that though. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=752.74s)]
*  That's good. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=754.22s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=755.22s)]
*  It is great. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=756.22s)]
*  But what scares me is what happened in New Orleans where they have these roads where [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=757.22s)]
*  only people walk down and everyone knows it and this psycho decides to kill a bunch of [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=763.34s)]
*  people. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=768.3s)]

*  But, I mean, there should be some sort of retractable posts that they can pull up. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=770.8599999999999s)]
*  Wasn't there for that one? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=775.54s)]
*  It wasn't up. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=776.54s)]
*  It wasn't up. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=777.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=778.54s)]
*  In New York, you know, it's a big concrete slab. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=779.54s)]
*  I was in France last year and they had these huge flower pots with beautiful flowers in [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=781.8599999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=789.4599999999999s)]
*  And I said, you know, this is the New York version is a huge concrete slab that says [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=790.4599999999999s)]
*  NYPD on it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=793.0999999999999s)]
*  And this is the French version, which was this enormous, beautiful flower pot. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=794.0999999999999s)]
*  That's serving a function and also beautiful. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=798.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=800.86s)]
*  Well, the French know how to do things. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=801.86s)]
*  They know how to do it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=802.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=803.86s)]

*  They know how to party. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=805.86s)]
*  They drink a lot of wine. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=806.86s)]
*  They stay thin somehow or another, which is odd. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=807.86s)]
*  Like I hope RFK Jr. figures that out. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=809.9399999999999s)]

*  I want to know how the Italians are so thin. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=814.3s)]

*  All the time. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=816.3s)]
*  I go to Italy and it's also like the standard cliche, but it is true. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=817.3s)]
*  You go there, you can eat the food and it doesn't affect you the same way. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=821.3399999999999s)]
*  And we don't even think twice about it. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=824.54s)]
*  We come back here and still order pizza and still feel like shit. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=826.38s)]
*  If I eat a pizza here, I feel so bloated. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=829.58s)]
*  I ate a pizza in Italy last summer and I ate the whole pizza too. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=832.1800000000001s)]

*  And I was like, I just would just resign myself to like the thud of it hitting my digestive [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=838.5400000000001s)]
*  tract and like feeling like I'm on drama mean, just like, I've resigned myself. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=844.4200000000001s)]

*  It means it's been slow cooked perfectly. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=910.14s)]
*  They have a thing where you want your brisket to fold but not break. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=912.7s)]
*  So they take a slice of brisket and they put it over their hand. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=916.34s)]
*  And if it breaks off, you fucked up. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=919.4200000000001s)]

*  Dude, I learned... [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=943.8199999999999s)]
*  Every time I'm here, I learn... [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=944.8199999999999s)]
*  I remember the last time, dude, we were talking Italian billiards. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=946.4599999999999s)]
*  I didn't even realize it was a different billiards. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=951.3s)]
*  Oh, they have a bunch of different billiards. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=953.22s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, that's funny. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=954.54s)]
*  I never had any idea about that brisket. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=956.78s)]
*  But... [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=958.9s)]
*  You know, it was all originally Germans? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=959.9s)]
*  That would do the brisket stuff? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=962.74s)]
*  Germans who came over through Texas, like Fredericksburg is one of the hubs of it. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=964.38s)]
*  It's all a bunch of Germans who came over here and they made smoked sausages. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=968.22s)]
*  And so they came over here and the brisket became a thing because brisket was not a choice [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=971.5s)]
*  cut. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=976.98s)]
*  It was a thing that they would throw away. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=977.98s)]
*  Like you wanted the steaks. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=979.22s)]
*  You wanted a T-bone. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=980.46s)]
*  So they would take the brisket and they just figured out, like if you just slowly cook [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=982.46s)]
*  it, you render it down and break down all the toughness of it. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=987.14s)]
*  And at the end, you have this delicious, tender, smoked perfection. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=990.74s)]
*  That puts me to sleep. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=996.22s)]
*  They know how to do it here, man. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=997.22s)]
*  They make the best fucking brisket on earth right here. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=999.0600000000001s)]
*  Terry Black's, Franklin's, La Barbecue, there's like a bunch of spots in town. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1002.1800000000001s)]
*  What's it, QB Barbecue? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1006.38s)]
*  Is that the Egyptian joint that I went to with Action Bronson? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1007.38s)]
*  That place is insane. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1012.4599999999999s)]
*  Oh man, having a meal with him would be super fun. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1013.4599999999999s)]
*  KB? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1015.5s)]
*  KG. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1016.5s)]
*  KG Barbecue. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1017.5s)]
*  So this gentleman came from Egypt and he was like a finance guy, I think, in Egypt. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1018.5s)]
*  Just working a regular job. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1024.54s)]
*  Came over here, fell in love with brisket, decided to just open up his own barbecue shop. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1025.54s)]
*  And so this guy makes these incredible recipes with Egyptian and Middle Eastern spices. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1031.22s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1037.98s)]
*  But with Texas barbecue. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1038.98s)]
*  Oh my God, it was so good. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1040.74s)]
*  It was so good. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1043.3s)]
*  Cool story. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1044.3s)]
*  And he's blowing up now. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1045.3s)]
*  And it's just a super nice guy too. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1046.3s)]
*  I love when someone does that. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1049.3s)]
*  It's like, fuck this job. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1050.58s)]
*  You know what I want to do? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1053.78s)]
*  I want to feed people. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1054.78s)]
*  I want to make brisket, awesome brisket. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1055.78s)]
*  I want to make a food truck. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1057.54s)]
*  And this guy, it becomes so popular so quickly that this guy has like a real business now [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1059.1399999999999s)]
*  and he's got a restaurant. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1063.74s)]
*  He's opening up a second one, I believe. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1065.06s)]
*  That was my favorite part of living in Los Angeles. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1066.82s)]
*  It's easy to make fun of LA for good reason, but for the most part, a lot of people were [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1069.6999999999998s)]
*  betting on themselves and a talent they had. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1074.12s)]
*  Not everyone's, but I do love that. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1078.26s)]
*  I always appreciated that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1079.26s)]
*  Yeah, I like living in a place where people are definitely going for something and taking [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1080.58s)]
*  chances. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1084.4199999999998s)]
*  The problem with LA is it also becomes attached with what is the engine that gets you to where [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1085.74s)]
*  you want to go. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1091.7s)]
*  And sometimes that engine is like pure narcissism. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1092.7s)]
*  Yeah, or fame. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1094.94s)]
*  If that's the goal. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1095.94s)]
*  Most of the time it's fame. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1097.34s)]
*  Which fuels the narcissism. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1099.1s)]
*  But I think a more interesting question is how do we find the thing that we're meant [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1100.9s)]
*  to do? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1108.22s)]
*  That Egyptian finance man found that brisket is his calling. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1109.22s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1112.54s)]
*  In his 30s. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1113.54s)]
*  In his 30s. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1114.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1116.34s)]
*  With a career. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1117.34s)]
*  Making money, having healthcare, still decided to give it up. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1118.34s)]
*  Living in Egypt, by the way. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1119.34s)]
*  It's not even close to Austin, Texas. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1121.1399999999999s)]
*  And he comes here, he doesn't just decide to make barbecue. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1123.54s)]
*  He decides to make barbecue in the home of barbecue. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1126.1s)]
*  The place. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1129.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1130.46s)]
*  He's like, fuck it. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1131.46s)]
*  If you want to learn jujitsu, go to Brazil. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1132.46s)]
*  He went right to the heart of it all. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1134.3799999999999s)]
*  I remember I was coaching tennis at University of Michigan. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1135.94s)]
*  I was making $31,000 a year. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1138.82s)]
*  And I go, I think I can make this in comedy. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1141.46s)]
*  If I'm going to get paid like shit, let me at least do what I want. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1144.02s)]
*  So of course the first year I left, first year I did comedy, I made whatever, $6,000 [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1147.7s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1151.5s)]
*  But I think often how much harder that would have been if I was making $100,000. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1153.1399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1157.34s)]
*  You know, it's, because I was poor, let's be poor and pick the thing I want to be doing. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1158.34s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1162.54s)]
*  But that's the thing about youth. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1163.54s)]
*  Youth is filled with, if you're 47 years old and you decide that you need to change careers, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1165.3s)]
*  you're going to be a folk singer and you have a family. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1171.1799999999998s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1173.6599999999999s)]
*  You have a Volvo. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1174.6599999999999s)]
*  You have a fucking mortgage, you idiot. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1175.6599999999999s)]
*  You have to go to work. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1178.34s)]
*  You have to go to work. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1179.34s)]
*  If you're going to make folk songs, you're going to make them on the two hours you have [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1180.34s)]
*  for yourself on the weekend when everybody else is out of the house. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1184.1399999999999s)]
*  You don't have any time for that. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1188.1s)]
*  Is it true that Rodney Dangerfield found comedy so late like that? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1189.34s)]
*  Well, Rodney did comedy and then quit, but kept writing and was selling aluminum siding. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1193.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1198.2199999999998s)]
*  That's what I remember that story. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1199.2199999999998s)]
*  He made it when he was like 46. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1200.58s)]
*  That's fucking awesome story. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1202.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1204.38s)]
*  How about Schimmel? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1205.38s)]
*  Schimmel didn't even start until he was 36, which I thought was crazy. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1206.38s)]
*  I remember when I heard it because I was a giant Schimmel fan. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1209.14s)]
*  And then when I had heard that he started when he was 36, I was like, what? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1212.1000000000001s)]
*  I didn't think you could do that. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1215.8600000000001s)]
*  I thought you had to start when you were like 21 or you had no chance. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1216.8600000000001s)]
*  I remember starting at 27 and wondering if it was too late. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1221.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1224.66s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1225.66s)]
*  Or maybe it was 25. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1226.66s)]
*  I forget. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1227.66s)]
*  I started at 27 because when I was 21, I was such a moron. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1229.1000000000001s)]
*  I just had no opinions on anything. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1231.8200000000002s)]
*  So all my jokes were basically about sex. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1234.5400000000002s)]
*  It was like sex and relationships. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1236.5400000000002s)]
*  Where were you at age 21? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1238.6200000000001s)]
*  Boston. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1239.8600000000001s)]
*  Boston. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1240.8600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1241.8600000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1242.8600000000001s)]
*  You were in, I was going to say because you were at least in a good comedy scene. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1243.8600000000001s)]
*  You could see good comedy. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1245.66s)]
*  Oh, it was a great comedy scene. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1246.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1247.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1248.66s)]
*  You've talked about that. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1249.66s)]
*  It was the best comedy scene. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1250.66s)]
*  It was the best comedy scene because it was a comedy scene that had world-class comedians [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1251.66s)]
*  that the rest of the country didn't know about. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1256.3400000000001s)]
*  So it was a cheat code. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1258.3s)]
*  It was like you're in a gym and you're sparring with world-class fighters, like world-championship [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1259.3s)]
*  caliber fighters that the rest of the world hasn't seen yet. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1263.38s)]
*  That emerges sometimes in fight gyms. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1266.34s)]
*  For sure. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1268.06s)]
*  You have a bunch of elite fighters and then all of a sudden there's three world champions [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1269.06s)]
*  in this gym two years later. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1272.5s)]
*  That's what it was like in Boston because there were these guys that were the Steve [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1274.74s)]
*  Sweeney's and the Don Gavin's who were as good as anybody that's ever done comedy. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1278.18s)]
*  No one knew who they were outside of Boston. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1283.26s)]
*  You get to see them every night just murdering. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1285.86s)]
*  Was their drive to get out? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1289.1799999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1290.86s)]
*  It was to make money, stay there? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1291.86s)]
*  Do coke and play golf. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1294.4199999999998s)]
*  Those guys were partying. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1295.4199999999998s)]
*  They probably figured. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1299.58s)]
*  I mean, I remember the documentary about Boston comedy where they said they would pay comics [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1300.58s)]
*  and coke. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1304.3s)]
*  It was a totally different kind of comedian. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1305.3s)]
*  There were these big football player looking men who were rowdy, who partied all the time. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1307.62s)]
*  They were all heavy drinkers. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1313.6599999999999s)]
*  They all played golf. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1315.34s)]
*  They were all animals. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1316.34s)]
*  They would go on stage and obliterate. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1317.34s)]
*  When I say obliterate, these guys would go on stage with a drink in their hand and they [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1320.62s)]
*  had a fucking act that was as hammered as a samurai sword. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1324.74s)]
*  It was polished. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1328.6999999999998s)]
*  And they would just fucking. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1330.26s)]
*  From the paws they would take to the eyebrow raise, all that. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1331.26s)]
*  Everything. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1333.9399999999998s)]
*  And a lot of it was like local references, like local Boston stuff. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1334.9399999999998s)]
*  They would bury these out of town comedians. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1340.3799999999999s)]
*  I saw them bury Billy Crystal one night. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1342.34s)]
*  Burry him. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1344.7s)]
*  Burry. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1345.7s)]
*  Death. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1346.7s)]
*  Death. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1347.7s)]
*  Satan was nipping at his heels and dragging him down into the netherworld. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1348.7s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1351.38s)]
*  He was in hell. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1352.38s)]
*  I feel like when I started comedy, drinking was still big. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1354.9s)]
*  Now I meet all the young comics and everybody's sober or they're thinking more about all the [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1358.46s)]
*  different facets. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1363.46s)]
*  But when I started, there wasn't YouTube yet. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1364.46s)]
*  Comics talk shit in the green room a lot. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1368.26s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1370.46s)]
*  I went and did Yuck Yucks in Vancouver recently. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1371.54s)]
*  In the green room there's a sign up that says we don't harass people in the green room. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1374.9s)]
*  And I'm like, this is different. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1378.78s)]
*  This is different. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1381.78s)]
*  Well Canada's just on another level with their wokeness. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1382.78s)]
*  Canada's on another level. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1385.94s)]
*  But come back to us Canada. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1387.42s)]
*  I remember driving down the road in Vancouver and there's all these people just lining up. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1389.98s)]
*  And I go, what's going on? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1397.52s)]
*  And they're lining up for the bus that's about to come. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1398.68s)]
*  And I'm like, that's Canadian. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1401.48s)]
*  They're so polite. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1403.6s)]
*  They're waiting. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1405.8s)]
*  They know where the bus will be and they're lining up. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1406.8s)]
*  That is not how it works in Brooklyn. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1407.8s)]
*  And then before they get on the bus they give their land acknowledgement. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1409.28s)]
*  Before they step on the bus. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1414.52s)]
*  Do you think that comedy with the polish, the local, I mean it feels like comedy's taking [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1416.4s)]
*  a different turn now. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1423.74s)]
*  Now if a bit is kind of working we post it. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1424.74s)]
*  It's up. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1427.32s)]
*  And I miss some of that. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1429.12s)]
*  I miss some of that. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1430.12s)]
*  There's some of that but there's still guys like Louie who don't do that and Attelle doesn't [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1431.6s)]
*  do that. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1437.2s)]
*  It's like I get for young guys coming up it's a very good way to develop an audience. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1438.2s)]
*  Like there's guys that have a clip, the clip goes viral on TikTok, all of a sudden they're [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1443.04s)]
*  selling out shows everywhere. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1446.3999999999999s)]
*  A guy like Ralph Barboza. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1447.8s)]
*  He's a funny guy. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1448.8s)]
*  Gets a funny bit. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1450.8s)]
*  It gets put up. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1451.8s)]
*  Bam. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1452.8s)]
*  All of a sudden he's headlining it all over the country. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1453.8s)]
*  It didn't happen to him like that. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1454.8s)]
*  He was opening for me in Dallas before any of that. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1456.3999999999999s)]
*  And you know you always watch the opener and normally I watch the opener like this. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1460.52s)]
*  Like god this is just, is this what I have to go up after? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1465.12s)]
*  Why didn't I bring my own guy? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1468.4799999999998s)]
*  You know whatever. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1469.6799999999998s)]
*  And I'm sitting in the green room and I'm going, ooh that's a good bit. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1470.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh that's a fun, oh the crowd's going. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1473.6s)]
*  And I'm going this guy's got it. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1475.32s)]
*  And then six months later I was like watching his special right? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1477.3999999999999s)]
*  Or it wasn't maybe a year later but yeah. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1481.0s)]
*  I mean that's a great example. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1483.6799999999998s)]
*  He's a funny dude. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1485.36s)]
*  Yeah it's a great example of what can be done with social media today. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1486.36s)]
*  You know and then there's these guys. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1490.9199999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of bad ones. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1491.9199999999998s)]
*  Like from Kill Tony where they do One Minute. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1493.08s)]
*  And a lot of these One Minute clips get put into reels and then these guys are getting [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1495.36s)]
*  huge responses for this. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1501.56s)]
*  And now they're doing the Killers of Kill Tony where they're selling out these huge [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1503.4399999999998s)]
*  places. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1506.6799999999998s)]
*  So it's amazing what can be done. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1507.9799999999998s)]
*  But they don't have an act. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1512.0s)]
*  Some of them do. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1513.84s)]
*  Ari Matty's 12 years in. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1515.0s)]
*  He was doing stand up in Australia. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1516.8s)]
*  I actually worked with him in Australia in like 2016 I think. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1518.12s)]
*  Somewhere around then. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1525.1599999999999s)]
*  2015 somewhere around then. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1526.1599999999999s)]
*  So Ari's been at it for a long time. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1528.0s)]
*  So he's really good. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1529.6s)]
*  He's a really solid comic. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1530.6s)]
*  So he's like headlining now because of this. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1531.9199999999998s)]
*  But there's guys that are in it four or five years and they don't really have an act yet [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1535.1599999999999s)]
*  but they have a couple of good jokes. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1539.12s)]
*  But they'll figure it out. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1541.4399999999998s)]
*  They'll figure it out. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1542.4399999999998s)]
*  But you don't want to figure all of it out on video in front of the whole world. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1543.56s)]
*  That's what it is now. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1548.04s)]
*  I'm so thankful that as soon as I could I posted my first set on the internet. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1549.04s)]
*  But that was seven years in. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1554.4s)]
*  You couldn't even do it. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1556.16s)]
*  I would have done it too soon. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1557.92s)]
*  I mean it still was too soon. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1559.28s)]
*  But it's okay. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1561.3200000000002s)]
*  You know look you go back and watch my first episodes of this podcast. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1562.3200000000002s)]
*  They were fucking terrible. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1565.04s)]
*  I encourage everybody to go back and watch them. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1566.04s)]
*  Where does one watch the first? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1568.0800000000002s)]
*  I bet they're on YouTube. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1571.16s)]
*  They're on somewhere. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1572.16s)]
*  It's everywhere. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1573.88s)]
*  But like when we first started doing it. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1574.88s)]
*  I mean there was no production value. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1576.4s)]
*  I was boring. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1579.48s)]
*  You know and then you figure out how to do it. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1580.48s)]
*  It's like stand up. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1582.0800000000002s)]
*  It's everything else. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1583.0800000000002s)]
*  Go back and watch someone's first amateur fight. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1584.64s)]
*  They were terrible. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1586.52s)]
*  They make mistakes. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1587.52s)]
*  It is very beautiful to watch people get better at stuff. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1589.2s)]
*  There's a female tennis player right now named Andreava. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1595.2s)]
*  I forget how to pronounce her first name. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1598.4s)]
*  But I just watched her at Indian Wells. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1600.48s)]
*  I saw her four years ago at the French Open. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1602.36s)]
*  Everyone was watching Andreava. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1604.96s)]
*  And I'm like this is a child that doesn't know how to play the sport. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1607.6s)]
*  Why are we talking about her? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1610.8s)]
*  I watched her last week in absolute nightmare of a beast. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1612.8s)]
*  You know hitting the ball. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1618.2s)]
*  The movement. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1619.48s)]
*  Her shape. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1620.48s)]
*  And it was like oh every day she got better. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1621.48s)]
*  And to see that was nuts. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1624.6s)]
*  And I always go back and watch. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1626.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1628.24s)]
*  I remember watching Djokovic's first Grand Slam when he's got like the worst haircut [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1630.16s)]
*  in the baggy shirt and the backhand was looking different. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1632.84s)]
*  Now it's just amazing to see how these athletes evolve. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1636.1200000000001s)]
*  And I'm sure it's the same for fighters. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1638.72s)]
*  You mentioned it was. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1640.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1641.32s)]
*  I love seeing that. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1642.32s)]
*  Yeah well tennis is like all things right? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1643.32s)]
*  When you really do it then you can truly appreciate people who are great. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1646.68s)]
*  There's so many things that are like in martial arts. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1652.04s)]
*  Especially when things go to the ground. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1655.76s)]
*  A lot of times people don't understand how difficult a specific maneuver is. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1656.96s)]
*  How he did that. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1662.1200000000001s)]
*  How he baited him. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1663.3200000000002s)]
*  And then you have to like there's certain things I watch and I'm like oh my god. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1664.3200000000002s)]
*  Does everybody appreciate this? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1668.5600000000002s)]
*  That was insane. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1670.0s)]
*  It's a language. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1671.0s)]
*  It's a language. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1672.0s)]
*  And if you don't speak the language. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1673.0s)]
*  I mean when I don't speak MMA language but that's where good commentators come in. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1674.0s)]
*  Oh they're excited for a reason. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1679.6000000000001s)]
*  That was something that we don't see very often and that helps me. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1681.92s)]
*  I assume that's how it works for tennis people that aren't or for non tennis people when [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1684.8799999999999s)]
*  they're watching tennis. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1688.08s)]
*  Oh I'm sure but I think only a person like you who is a professional could appreciate [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1689.08s)]
*  the technique involved and like the changing of Djokovic's backstring. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1693.32s)]
*  I mean I pause it. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1697.28s)]
*  I make my wife come into the living room and I say watch this and she'll watch and she'll [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1700.12s)]
*  go that was good. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1703.56s)]
*  And I go are you even seeing what he did? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1704.56s)]
*  He did a short slice to pull him in and then he went and it's like but it's a language [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1706.8s)]
*  that I speak. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1711.32s)]
*  This is life man. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1713.52s)]
*  Picking these little things we have that we get passionate about is just awesome. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1714.52s)]
*  As I've gotten older I used to shy away from tennis a little bit. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1718.8s)]
*  It's an elite sport. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1722.2s)]
*  It's got its own history and now I'm just like I fucking love it. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1723.84s)]
*  I love that I'm good at it. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1726.52s)]
*  I love that I know it. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1727.6399999999999s)]
*  The Wokies pushed you away from tennis. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1728.6399999999999s)]
*  No the Wokies pushed me away from tennis. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1730.12s)]
*  It sounds like it did. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1731.12s)]
*  It sounds like it was a little too elite. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1732.12s)]
*  It was a little too country club. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1734.12s)]
*  A little too segregated. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1736.6399999999999s)]
*  It definitely is those things. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1738.08s)]
*  No I think what happens. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1741.04s)]
*  It doesn't have to be. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1742.24s)]
*  It doesn't have to be and that's why Serena and Venus were such a fun fuck up to the sport. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1743.24s)]
*  Do you know the Freeway Ricky Ross story? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1749.6399999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1751.72s)]
*  Freeway Ricky Ross was a guy who you know Rick Ross the rapper. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1752.72s)]
*  He named himself after a famous cocaine dealer in Los Angeles called Freeway Ricky Ross. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1756.68s)]
*  Freeway Ricky Ross was selling cocaine unbeknownst to him for the CIA to fund the Contras versus [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1762.32s)]
*  the Sandinistas. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1767.56s)]
*  Okay yeah so this is the cocaine cowboy type stuff isn't it? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1768.56s)]
*  This is about Oliver North. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1772.88s)]
*  This was all about funneling money into the war. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1774.48s)]
*  He was a tennis player. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1778.88s)]
*  Like an elite tennis player. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1779.88s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1781.24s)]
*  Couldn't even read. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1782.24s)]
*  Couldn't read. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1783.24s)]
*  And was this really good tennis player who that was like what he was his hope for a scholarship. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1784.24s)]
*  Gets involved, starts selling cocaine, starts selling a lot of cocaine. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1791.32s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1794.1200000000001s)]
*  Doesn't know how he's so successful because he's working with the CIA. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1795.1200000000001s)]
*  The CIA is helping him. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1797.04s)]
*  Goes to jail, learns how to read when he's in jail, becomes a lawyer in jail, gets himself [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1798.12s)]
*  off because they tried him on three strikes but they did it for one incident. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1803.72s)]
*  So they did it incorrectly and so he gets out of jail. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1808.3999999999999s)]
*  So incarceration educated him to the point where he got himself out. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1811.8s)]
*  But is there origins or as a tennis player? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1815.6s)]
*  As a tennis player. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1817.1599999999999s)]
*  He's a tennis player. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1818.1599999999999s)]
*  Like a really good tennis player. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1819.1599999999999s)]
*  You know Menendez brothers, excellent tennis players. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1820.3999999999999s)]
*  One of them played at UCLA. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1823.36s)]
*  Maybe not the best example. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1824.36s)]
*  I'm talking about a guy from South Central LA who can't read. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1827.44s)]
*  Just to say it's not necessarily an elite sport. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1832.0s)]
*  It doesn't have to be. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1834.84s)]
*  It's just a sport. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1835.84s)]
*  I agree. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1836.84s)]
*  And all you need is a court. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1837.84s)]
*  You mean it seems pretty cheap. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1838.84s)]
*  You need a flat surface, a tennis racket and a ball. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1839.84s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1843.28s)]
*  The kids that were beating me when I was a pro played on a dirt court with a rope tied [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1844.28s)]
*  between two sticks. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1849.6s)]
*  These South American and Russian players, it was not a money sport. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1851.84s)]
*  It was not a sport of money. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1855.94s)]
*  It was a sport of movement and competition. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1857.64s)]
*  And because there's no clock, you can have as much time as you want to figure out and [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1860.18s)]
*  beat down your opponent. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1866.54s)]
*  So that gets a certain type of athlete. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1868.22s)]
*  I think it was Jimmy Connors who said, I didn't lose. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1871.3s)]
*  I just ran out of time in that match. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1874.66s)]
*  I would have figured it out. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1876.8200000000002s)]
*  But unfortunately he beat me. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1878.14s)]
*  What happened with me, I was trying to be a standup comic so badly that I was trying [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1881.42s)]
*  to remove the athletic stigma. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1890.22s)]
*  Even now, you sometimes say tennis and people kind of back up. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1893.5s)]
*  But as I got better at comedy and more confident in my abilities, I said, why am I shying away [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1897.14s)]
*  from the sport that I love and that is such a foundational part of me? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1901.4s)]
*  Isn't that weird that you felt like you had to move away from athletics in order to fit [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1904.8200000000002s)]
*  in in comedy? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1909.3s)]
*  That's probably a more succinct way to say it. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1911.4199999999998s)]
*  And the new book that's out right now, Lucky Loser, is all about how I'm now embracing [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1912.9199999999998s)]
*  this tennis because it gave me all the skills to actually be good in comedy. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1919.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1922.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1923.48s)]
*  Discipline, realizing like the tennis player that you were talking about, that if you do [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1924.48s)]
*  put in the work over time, the results will pay off and you'll see it. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1927.44s)]
*  And you're alone. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1931.52s)]
*  Figure that shit out by yourself. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1933.96s)]
*  You're alone and you're going to have no teammates. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1935.68s)]
*  Success and failure. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1937.9199999999998s)]
*  When I was eight years old, I lost in the finals of the Ann Arbor Junior Open and I [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1939.8s)]
*  realized I was going to lose and I started crying on the court. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1944.68s)]
*  And my older brother runs on the court and holds me like a child. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1948.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm crying. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1953.6399999999999s)]
*  There's a picture of that in the book. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1955.36s)]
*  Now as a parent, I'm going, who the fuck took that picture? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1957.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1960.36s)]
*  I'm just a kid crying and my brother's holding me because my parents taking that picture. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1961.36s)]
*  They did it for the gram. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1965.0s)]
*  Man, as a comic, holy shit, we've all felt like that. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1968.12s)]
*  Oh man, it's so personal when you fail as a comic. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1970.8799999999999s)]
*  It's important to learn how to lose at things, at everything. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1974.7199999999998s)]
*  If you marry your high school sweetheart and you guys never broke up and that's the... [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1978.32s)]
*  You probably missed out on me. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1982.2399999999998s)]
*  Congratulations on achieving the most difficult thing humanly possible that everybody admires. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1984.76s)]
*  When you meet a couple, and I have two friends of mine that have actually been dating since [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1990.28s)]
*  they were like 16 years old and now they're married with kids in their 40s. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=1995.72s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2000.0400000000002s)]
*  But I think there's some value in getting your ass kicked. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2001.0400000000002s)]
*  I think there's some value in a girl saying, no, I don't even like you. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2004.4s)]
*  Like, no, you don't like me? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2008.76s)]
*  I think it's good getting dumped is good. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2011.6000000000001s)]
*  I think all that's valuable. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2013.92s)]
*  I think you have to learn. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2015.44s)]
*  And I don't think you learn by winning all the time and I don't think you learn if something's [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2016.96s)]
*  easy. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2020.92s)]
*  Which is why really handsome and really beautiful people are often ridiculous in the way they [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2021.92s)]
*  behave because they have five aces and they didn't earn them. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2027.1200000000001s)]
*  They were just born with five aces. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2031.96s)]
*  So how do you instill grit, toughness in a generation? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2033.88s)]
*  As a parent, I see my five-year-old struggling. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2038.8400000000001s)]
*  I oftentimes pop in, let me get that for you. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2042.52s)]
*  She's trying to do the little things, trying to do the buttons on her shirt. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2044.88s)]
*  I do it for her and I think, I shouldn't do it for her. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2048.32s)]
*  She should be struggling to do this. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2050.56s)]
*  But this is a big issue right now, right? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2052.4s)]
*  The younger generation, you hear that word grit. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2054.0s)]
*  How do we instill that? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2056.12s)]
*  Well sports is a great way to do it. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2057.24s)]
*  It doesn't work with everybody because some people play sports and they come out even [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2058.7999999999997s)]
*  cunty or yeah, they come out more aggressive or more competitive or more psychotic in their [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2061.56s)]
*  pursuits and it just like alienates everything else in their life. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2067.18s)]
*  Or it creates trauma for them. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2070.58s)]
*  Not real trauma, but. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2071.7999999999997s)]
*  Or real trauma. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2073.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2074.16s)]
*  Fucking head trauma if you're playing football. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2075.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2076.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2077.16s)]
*  There's, I think difficult things are important for kids. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2078.16s)]
*  Because it doesn't necessarily have to be that. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2080.28s)]
*  It could be art. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2082.2400000000002s)]
*  It could be music. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2083.2400000000002s)]
*  It could be something. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2084.2400000000002s)]
*  But I think there's something when you put your attention to something and realize you [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2085.2400000000002s)]
*  can get better at this thing and you find yourself in that thing and you find your potential [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2088.8s)]
*  in that thing that you focus on. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2092.6800000000003s)]
*  It doesn't have to, it's not necessarily that it has to define you because oftentimes it [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2094.96s)]
*  does unfortunately. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2099.28s)]
*  When people are really good at a thing, it becomes the whole essence of who they are [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2100.7000000000003s)]
*  as a person. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2104.4s)]
*  It's a valuable tool for elevating your human potential. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2106.44s)]
*  And it's also a way that you can quantify effort versus results. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2110.48s)]
*  And you can do that in sports and games and in think chess and art and things that are [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2116.1600000000003s)]
*  difficult. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2121.28s)]
*  Like you can say like, I am so much better at playing guitar now because I've been playing [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2122.28s)]
*  three hours a day for six months. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2124.84s)]
*  And look at what I can do now. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2127.1600000000003s)]
*  So I know that there's a thing. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2129.08s)]
*  It teaches you that if there's a thing that you really love and you focus on it, that [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2131.0s)]
*  thing, if someone does it for a living, why can't you? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2135.88s)]
*  Why can't you? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2139.96s)]
*  Why do I have to be in this fucking bullshit office in this cubicle with these stupid papers [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2140.96s)]
*  that I don't give a shit about that I have to fill out for this company that I don't [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2145.48s)]

*  I obsessed over it. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2253.5s)]
*  I fucking sucked at it, dude. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2255.2s)]
*  I couldn't do it. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2256.44s)]

*  And then I'm thinking, I pick up this tennis racket and it all kind of clicks very quickly. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2260.44s)]
*  Well, you have a good frame for tennis, first of all. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2265.52s)]

*  I saw that in Pretty Woman. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2297.08s)]
*  But I mean, Pete had like extra length. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2302.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2305.08s)]
*  And people go, how did he get the pop on the serve? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2306.08s)]
*  It's like, you know, those torque. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2307.08s)]
*  Like Tommy Hearns with his punches. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2308.08s)]
*  Tommy Hearns was so long and tall. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2310.08s)]
*  Like Deontay Wilder is another example. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2312.6800000000003s)]
*  Those long, tall guys, when you have this torque, like you ever see Deontay Wilder? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2314.72s)]
*  No. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2320.12s)]
*  He's arguably the greatest one punch knockout artist in the history of the heavyweight division. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2321.12s)]
*  At one point in time, he was like, what is Deontay's record? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2326.7599999999998s)]
*  I think it's like 40 and he's had a few losses recently. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2331.52s)]
*  But at one point in time, he had like 39 knockouts out of 40 fights. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2334.8399999999997s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2341.2799999999997s)]
*  Which is insane. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2342.2799999999997s)]
*  And these are professional fighters he's knocking out. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2344.36s)]
*  It's not me. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2346.4s)]
*  And he's undersized for the heavyweight division. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2347.4s)]
*  When he fought Tyson Fury, Tyson Fury was like 260. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2349.52s)]
*  He was 209. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2352.34s)]
*  209. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2353.34s)]
*  He made it to 40 and 0. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2354.34s)]
*  40 and 0 and 39 of those 40 were knockouts. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2356.84s)]
*  Look at everybody. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2361.86s)]
*  Knockout, TKO, KO. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2362.86s)]
*  He knocked out everybody. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2366.7400000000002s)]
*  Get the Louis Ortiz fight. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2369.02s)]
*  Show him the Louis Ortiz fight. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2371.46s)]
*  I have this extremely ignorant question. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2373.18s)]
*  When you say knockout, that means like the guy's done. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2374.96s)]
*  That's not like the ref calls it. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2378.8599999999997s)]
*  TKO is the ref calls it. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2380.58s)]
*  Knockout is like, it's over. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2382.96s)]
*  You got flatlined. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2384.74s)]
*  And these are guys that know how to take hits. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2385.74s)]
*  Elite guys. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2387.9s)]
*  Well, this guy, Louis Ortiz was on the Cuban Olympic team. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2388.9s)]
*  He's a fucking elite fighter and he was really durable. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2391.44s)]
*  And Deontay, he's the one with his back to us. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2394.3799999999997s)]
*  He's long and tall, but he's not giant. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2397.74s)]
*  He's not a big guy in comparison to a lot of these guys. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2400.84s)]
*  But he catches him with a right hand and flattens him. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2404.38s)]
*  I think this is the first time they fought, Jamie. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2408.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the second one is the KO with one punch. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2410.52s)]
*  So he beat him up in the first fight too. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2414.1000000000004s)]
*  But Ortiz is an elite boxer and Deontay is not the best boxer. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2415.96s)]
*  He's just a hitter. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2421.4s)]
*  Got a hitter. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2422.4s)]
*  And he's just waiting, waiting, waiting. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2423.4s)]
*  Blam! [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2425.6000000000004s)]
*  And he hits guys and they're like, what the fuck? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2426.6000000000004s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2428.28s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2429.28s)]
*  Wow, that didn't even seem like it was that hard of a hit. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2431.28s)]
*  And this is an elite heavyweight. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2436.0400000000004s)]
*  Show it again. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2438.4s)]
*  Show it again. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2439.4s)]
*  Because it's so crazy. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2440.4s)]
*  It's just one punch. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2441.4s)]
*  It's just black. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2442.4s)]
*  Jeez. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2443.4s)]
*  So Wilder just waits, waits, waits. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2444.4s)]
*  It's all waiting. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2448.52s)]
*  It's not boxing. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2449.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2450.52s)]
*  He's just waiting. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2451.52s)]
*  Waiting for his chance. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2452.52s)]
*  Look at that record. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2453.52s)]
*  Look at that record. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2454.7599999999998s)]
*  Right here. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2459.7599999999998s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2462.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, you got that kind of power. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2463.7599999999998s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2467.88s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2468.88s)]
*  That's hard for us to, it's hard for me to even wrap my head around. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2469.88s)]
*  See if they show it in the replay. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2472.32s)]
*  Because he hits him on the forehead, which is so crazy. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2474.06s)]
*  Just before that. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2477.14s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2478.14s)]
*  Right there. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2479.14s)]
*  Just before it, Jamie. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2480.14s)]
*  Okay, here it is. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2481.14s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2482.14s)]
*  Not punching, waiting. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2483.7599999999998s)]
*  He's just waiting. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2485.7599999999998s)]
*  He's just waiting. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2486.7599999999998s)]
*  He's just pawing at him with his left hand and bang. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2487.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2490.3599999999997s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2491.8599999999997s)]
*  Bro. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2492.8599999999997s)]
*  But it's all that torque and length and leverage and just God given power like nobody has. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2493.8599999999997s)]
*  Jeez. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2501.46s)]
*  And the fucking slow motion. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2502.46s)]
*  Bro, that is so crazy. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2503.46s)]
*  The slow motion camera. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2504.46s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2505.46s)]
*  And look at the torque. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2506.46s)]
*  Look at the wide shoulders and the timing and the speed and watch just straightens out [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2507.46s)]
*  right on his fucking noggin. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2512.7599999999998s)]
*  Boom. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2515.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, and these. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2516.7599999999998s)]
*  And the follow through with the shoulder. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2518.46s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2520.18s)]
*  In these sports like mixed martial arts too, these sports aren't for me because one punch [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2521.98s)]
*  it's done. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2530.4199999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2531.4199999999996s)]
*  Meaning, meaning I like watching that. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2532.4199999999996s)]
*  Meaning I wouldn't have been a good athlete in that sport. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2533.66s)]
*  Why do you think that? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2538.58s)]
*  Well, like in tennis what I love is if you're just bombing aces after the first set, clean [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2540.02s)]
*  slate we start all over again. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2547.54s)]
*  And in boxing you make one mistake like that and it's done. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2549.86s)]
*  Well against that guy. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2555.1800000000003s)]
*  Against that guy. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2556.1800000000003s)]
*  But that's very unusual. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2557.1800000000003s)]
*  Most guys can't do that. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2558.1800000000003s)]
*  They can't do that. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2559.1800000000003s)]
*  Most guys can hit you pretty hard. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2560.1800000000003s)]
*  You would take a hard hit but you could recover. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2561.1800000000003s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2562.98s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2563.98s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2564.98s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2565.98s)]
*  And he's also in a world of his own again because he's not big. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2567.1s)]
*  Like there's Daniel Dubois who is the, I forget which division he's the champion of right [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2570.54s)]
*  now but he's a giant heavyweight who knocks everybody out. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2576.34s)]
*  But he's 255, 260, built like a tank. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2580.02s)]
*  Deontay is literally 40 plus pounds lighter than that. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2583.78s)]
*  And just one punch. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2588.42s)]
*  I liked how we watched a lot of that and he hadn't even thrown a punch. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2590.62s)]
*  He's a hitter. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2594.7400000000002s)]
*  He's a hitter. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2595.7400000000002s)]
*  He's not going to out box you and be slick. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2597.5s)]
*  In fact his movement is sometimes awkward. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2599.4599999999996s)]
*  He's criticized for having bad footwork. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2602.54s)]
*  His legs look like sticks. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2604.8999999999996s)]
*  He has the skinniest legs you've ever seen in your life. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2606.54s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2609.02s)]
*  You look at his legs like how? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2610.02s)]
*  But the power this guy generates is out of this world. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2612.8599999999997s)]
*  So his software during a fight is just constantly trying to find the open for one of these huge [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2615.7s)]
*  punches. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2621.14s)]
*  That's the whole time he's doing it. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2622.14s)]
*  He's not boxing you. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2623.2999999999997s)]
*  He's boxing kind of but he's really looking for the big one. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2624.86s)]
*  And you know if that big one lands it's nighty night for everybody. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2628.46s)]
*  The only one who's able to survive it is Tyson Fury because he's a fucking animal. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2631.66s)]
*  And he rose from the dead in the 12th round of their fight where it looked like Deontay [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2636.7799999999997s)]
*  had knocked him out cold. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2640.82s)]
*  Deontay even went like that at the end of it because he hit him with a right hand and [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2641.82s)]
*  then a left hook as he was going down. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2644.94s)]
*  And he went flat out on his back and Tyson Fury rose like the Undertaker and got right [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2647.06s)]
*  back and won the rest of the round. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2650.98s)]
*  But that's just because he's a, that's another very very rare human being, Tyson Fury, just [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2652.94s)]
*  an animal. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2657.7000000000003s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2658.7000000000003s)]
*  Just an animal. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2659.7000000000003s)]
*  One of the greatest boxers of all time. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2660.7000000000003s)]
*  And one of the greatest heavyweights without a doubt of all time. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2661.7000000000003s)]
*  When you get hit like that there's got to be an enormous physical pain, duh. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2664.78s)]
*  But then there also is like, don't you get scared then after a big hit like that? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2671.34s)]
*  Well you get super confused. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2675.34s)]
*  You get confused. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2676.94s)]
*  Because I would get scared. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2677.94s)]
*  You know you got to kind of shake off the cobwebs, your ears are ringing, your legs [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2678.94s)]
*  don't work right anymore. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2682.7s)]
*  When you get knocked down, I only got TKO'd once in a kickboxing fight and ironically [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2684.4199999999996s)]
*  it didn't hurt. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2689.7s)]
*  The punch that hit me just twisted my jaw. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2690.7s)]
*  He hit me with a left hook and my legs just gave out. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2693.22s)]
*  Like weep, like gone. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2695.8999999999996s)]
*  It's the craziest feeling. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2697.4199999999996s)]
*  It's not like you got hurt, it's like your legs just shut off. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2699.74s)]
*  Like he clipped me with a left hook that I didn't see in an exchange and when you get [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2703.4199999999996s)]
*  something happens in the jaw and I don't know what it is with the nerves behind your neck [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2709.7s)]
*  but it just shuts everything off. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2713.8599999999997s)]
*  And you're conscious, which is weird. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2716.06s)]
*  So it was completely conscious but my legs just disconnected and went down but they reconnected [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2718.5s)]
*  right away and I got up and I was like, oh no, I'm in trouble. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2723.8599999999997s)]
*  They weren't working good. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2727.22s)]
*  Like everything wasn't working good. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2728.22s)]
*  And then I got dropped again and he hit me with an uppercut and dropped me and then the [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2729.22s)]
*  referee stopped the fight. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2731.46s)]
*  But totally conscious the whole time. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2732.9399999999996s)]
*  But the feeling that you get when you get hit real hard is real weird. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2735.18s)]
*  It's like nothing works right anymore. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2739.98s)]
*  And you got to get on your bike and try to move around and get everything working again [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2742.14s)]
*  and it might take 30 seconds before. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2745.2200000000003s)]
*  And that's that 30 seconds when he's also trained to kill you. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2746.9s)]
*  Now in the UFC it's way more accurate because when you get knocked down they climb on top [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2750.34s)]
*  of you and beat your fucking brains in or strangle you. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2755.46s)]
*  Which is really what's supposed to happen. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2758.3s)]
*  The whole thing of letting someone get up, what you're really doing is giving them a [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2760.18s)]
*  chance to get more damage. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2763.94s)]
*  Because they can recover but not all the way, you know, sometimes. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2766.2200000000003s)]
*  Sometimes a guy gets rocked early in a fight and you can tell for the whole rest of the [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2770.1s)]
*  fight they're still fucked up and they're very defensive. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2773.62s)]
*  So it's safer in your opinion the way UFC does it where if you start wobbling I'm immediately [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2776.42s)]
*  on you trying to kill you and then it's like as opposed to boxing where they would get [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2782.54s)]
*  you up and you can maybe. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2787.54s)]
*  I don't think either one is safe. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2788.54s)]
*  I think it's an unsafe sport. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2790.7000000000003s)]
*  It's as safe as we can make it. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2793.02s)]
*  We have laws when you can hit someone you can't hit them in the back of the head. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2794.86s)]
*  But it's not safe. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2799.7s)]
*  It's a very dangerous, very scary sport. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2800.7s)]
*  But I think realistically when someone gets hurt and someone finishes them off on the [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2803.62s)]
*  ground that's probably less damage than they would have taken if you gave them a standing [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2809.98s)]
*  eight count, dusted their gloves off, made them move forward and let them go back again [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2814.98s)]
*  and get really mollywalloped. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2819.48s)]
*  Because a lot of times those were where the real bad chaos come from is when a guy's hurt [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2822.2999999999997s)]
*  and then he stands up. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2826.2999999999997s)]
*  The only thing I can even closely compare this to is being in a car accident. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2828.7s)]
*  Let me show you one of the greatest examples of that. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2834.02s)]
*  Alex Pereira who was a two division glory world champion. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2836.18s)]
*  Pull up Alex Pereira, KOs Jason Willness. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2841.3399999999997s)]
*  So he's like the most destructive kickboxer in the history of the sport. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2844.68s)]
*  He went over to the UFC, became a two division UFC champion. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2850.74s)]
*  Just lost his title last weekend in a really close fight, great fight. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2854.52s)]
*  But he hits this guy with a head kick and drops him and you can tell this guy's fucked. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2857.9s)]
*  But they give him the standing eight because he's in kickboxing not in MMA. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2864.14s)]
*  They give him the standing eight count, dust his gloves off, you okay, come forward and [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2866.74s)]
*  then he gets hit with a flying knee on the chin and just sent into the shadow realm. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2870.62s)]
*  And it didn't need to happen this way. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2876.66s)]
*  And this is what happens when you take a guy who's like really rocked and kind of fucked. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2879.38s)]
*  So watch this. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2883.94s)]
*  So he catches him with a head kick. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2884.94s)]
*  So he's, by the way, Jason Willness had beaten him twice before so he drops him with the [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2887.6400000000003s)]
*  left hand. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2891.86s)]
*  Is this the first fight? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2892.86s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2893.86s)]
*  Or is this the head kick? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2894.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2896.62s)]
*  I'm the full fight. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2897.62s)]
*  I don't know if this is the one. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2898.86s)]
*  I think this is the one when they went back and forth. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2900.3s)]
*  I don't think this is the one where he KOs him. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2902.7000000000003s)]
*  I think this is the one where he drops him. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2904.1800000000003s)]
*  65, maybe I guess that's later. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2905.86s)]
*  Yeah, try to find the later one. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2907.94s)]
*  This is it. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2910.34s)]
*  This is the one. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2911.34s)]
*  Because I can tell by his haircut. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2912.34s)]
*  So Pereira at this time was the champion and he was getting revenge on Willness who had [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2913.34s)]
*  beaten him before and stopped him with low kicks in one of their fights. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2918.2200000000003s)]
*  So he head kicks him. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2920.98s)]
*  Boom! [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2921.98s)]
*  So right now he's fucked. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2922.98s)]
*  Then on MMA he would follow up, beat him a couple times, that would be it. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2923.98s)]
*  But Willness is like, they're giving him a chance to clear his head. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2927.66s)]
*  Your coach to like get up immediately, show that you're okay. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2930.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2933.54s)]
*  And he's like, move forward, then watch this. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2934.54s)]
*  Boom! [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2936.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh my god! [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2937.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's the kind of shit that happens when you're really already fucked. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2938.8999999999996s)]
*  So he can hit you with this flying scissor knee right on the chin. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2943.02s)]
*  What the fuck is that, dude? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2947.1s)]
*  He's the most ferocious knockout artist literally in the history of the sport. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2948.9399999999996s)]
*  Look at this, on the chin. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2951.98s)]
*  And that's like legal and everything. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2953.46s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's encouraged. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2955.66s)]
*  It's not just legal, that's celebrated. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2959.46s)]
*  That's one of the greatest techniques in the history of the sport. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2961.7599999999998s)]
*  And Alex Pereira, that's how he won his first UFC fight. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2963.98s)]
*  You're the nasty one with that. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2967.52s)]
*  Want to see another nasty one? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2968.52s)]
*  Pull up Pereira, Kaos, Michaelitis. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2970.08s)]
*  You want to see another nasty one? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2972.6s)]
*  This is Pereira's first entrance into the UFC. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2974.92s)]
*  And I'm a giant fan of kickboxing. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2978.32s)]
*  So I watch Muay Thai, I watch Dutch kickboxing, I watch Glory, I watch everything I can about [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2981.24s)]
*  kickboxing. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2987.04s)]
*  And I knew this guy was really special. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2988.04s)]
*  So I was completely hyping him up in this first UFC fight. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2989.96s)]
*  I'm like, just watch. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2993.84s)]
*  And he came through in flying colors. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2996.36s)]
*  And he came through with that flying knee. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=2999.12s)]
*  It's so nuts, the amount of power this guy can generate. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3001.44s)]
*  With punches and with kicks, but with a flying knee. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3005.66s)]
*  You have so much torque. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3008.7400000000002s)]
*  You're literally throwing your body weight up into the air. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3010.68s)]
*  So how do you avoid a flying knee? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3014.08s)]
*  Just step out of the way? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3015.6s)]
*  It's in the second round, Jamie, so it's right after this. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3016.6s)]
*  Right at the beginning of the second round. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3020.12s)]
*  So they start the second round and he's like, fuck this dude. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3022.08s)]
*  I'm just going to catch him coming in and flatline him. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3025.84s)]
*  This is, watch this. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3030.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, this is nutty. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3032.24s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3035.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3036.68s)]
*  That is so fast. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3050.2s)]
*  He's such a fucking animal. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3051.3199999999997s)]
*  He's such a monster, dude. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3053.68s)]
*  So how would you even, you can't block that. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3054.9199999999996s)]
*  You just try to get out of the way of that? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3057.68s)]
*  Well, you have to get the fuck out of the way of that. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3058.68s)]
*  You don't want to block that because if you're, well, you certainly should block it rather [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3060.3599999999997s)]
*  than take it on the chin. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3063.9199999999996s)]
*  But once he's in the air like that, if that catches your arms, you can break your forearm. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3065.2s)]
*  I mean, the amount of power that's involved in that particular technique is fucking extraordinary [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3070.64s)]
*  because it's a natural movement of your hips. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3076.8799999999997s)]
*  It's a thing that you do your whole life, running and jumping. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3081.08s)]
*  So you can explode very quickly and you're hitting someone with your knee, which is the [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3085.04s)]
*  most immobile part. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3089.3199999999997s)]
*  If you want to hit someone with a joint, it's elbows and knees, but the knees preferable. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3091.52s)]
*  But aren't you putting yourself in a vulnerable position to throw a flying knee? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3096.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you got to wait till the guy's fucked and that's what he does. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3099.6s)]
*  He waits till you're fucked. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3102.4s)]
*  Because you are jumping in the air and exposing yourself. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3104.0s)]
*  So what I would do is I would move out of the way, Joe, and then I would pop him. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3106.72s)]
*  But some guys are just really good. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3111.56s)]
*  Like John Jones, when he won the light heavyweight title, one of the craziest things that John [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3112.56s)]
*  did, he was 22 years old and he's fighting Mauricio Shogunhua, who is a legend. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3116.64s)]
*  He was a light heavyweight champion. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3121.6s)]
*  He was a legend of this organization called Pride in Japan where they sold out like 90,000 [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3122.6s)]
*  seat arenas. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3127.96s)]
*  I mean, he's a real legend of the sport and John opens with a flying knee. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3128.96s)]
*  Opens, first move, flying knee, catches him. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3133.24s)]
*  And then just beats the shit out of him and wins the title and becomes the youngest ever [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3136.2s)]
*  UFC champion. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3139.6s)]
*  That's a great name. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3140.6s)]
*  This is the beginning of the fight. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3141.6s)]
*  Now, Shogun is, like I said, he's a fucking legend and a knockout artist. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3143.08s)]
*  And John starts right away. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3148.72s)]
*  Boom, flying knee to open up the fight. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3150.72s)]
*  And just put on a clinic, put on a clinic and won the title at 22 years of age. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3156.68s)]
*  That's a ballsy move to start with that. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3160.7599999999998s)]
*  He's a ballsy motherfucker. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3162.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3163.2s)]
*  That's a big swing right out of the gate. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3164.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3165.2s)]
*  The flying knee. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3166.2s)]
*  Crazy move. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3167.2s)]
*  And then you pull it off and it helps being tall. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3168.7999999999997s)]
*  Like Alex is very tall. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3170.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3171.3199999999997s)]
*  John's tall. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3172.3199999999997s)]
*  So it's hard to hit their chin. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3173.3199999999997s)]
*  But you know, it doesn't always work. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3174.3199999999997s)]
*  Like sometimes guys do it and they get knocked out cold. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3177.16s)]
*  How does your fucking kneecap not break too? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3179.52s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3181.4399999999996s)]
*  No, your kneecap versus chin. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3182.4399999999996s)]
*  I'll take kneecap all day long. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3183.52s)]
*  Especially when your knees are bent and you're hitting them with this part right here. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3185.0s)]
*  You can hit that pretty hard on things. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3188.08s)]
*  You'd be surprised. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3189.8399999999997s)]
*  I have so much respect for these athletes and I'm also, I can't be far enough away [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3191.04s)]
*  from it. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3196.7s)]
*  I want to show you the flying kneecap. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3198.2s)]
*  Let's go wrong. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3199.2s)]
*  Pull up Fedor Emelianenko versus, oh, Andrei Orlovsky. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3200.2s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3208.18s)]
*  You want to see a flying kneecap wrong. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3209.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3210.18s)]
*  Andrei Orlovsky, Fedor Emelianenko. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3211.18s)]
*  So this is, Andrei Orlovsky was actually winning this fight and he actually was kind of tuning [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3212.3799999999997s)]
*  Fedor up and he was hitting him with some big shots and he got a little crazy. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3216.58s)]
*  And he leapt in with a flying knee and got flat lined. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3220.52s)]
*  Well that's what I'm, that's, that's what I was thinking. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3222.74s)]
*  This is what I would do. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3225.98s)]
*  I was thinking, this is a vulnerable position. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3227.26s)]
*  You don't want to be in the air. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3228.26s)]
*  True. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3229.9s)]
*  So he's fighting the guy with the bald head. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3230.9s)]
*  That's Fedor Emelianenko who's a legend. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3233.86s)]
*  So watch Orlovsky. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3235.58s)]
*  He catches him with a kick. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3236.94s)]
*  He's feeling cocky, tries to flying knee. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3237.94s)]
*  Boom. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3239.86s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3240.86s)]
*  Flat lined. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3241.86s)]
*  But he's fighting and Fedor, that's literally the greatest heavyweight of all time. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3242.86s)]
*  If not one of the greatest, like there's the argument that he's the greatest. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3246.1s)]
*  So he catches him on the chin as he's leaping in. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3249.9s)]
*  Like perfect punch. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3252.9s)]
*  So the guy with the beard thought. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3254.5400000000004s)]
*  He thought he was vulnerable. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3255.98s)]
*  He was beating his ass a little bit. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3258.1400000000003s)]
*  And he made a mistake. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3259.42s)]
*  And he tried to come in cocky with a flying knee and he got clipped on the jaw. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3260.42s)]
*  And as soon as he gets hit, you just see that his flying knee knee just dropped. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3264.34s)]
*  Also you got to think where Fedor threw that punch because Fedor knew he was going in the [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3268.1000000000004s)]
*  air. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3271.5600000000004s)]
*  This is like the reads this guy's able to get. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3272.5600000000004s)]
*  He sees Orlovsky make a motion, like bend at the knees. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3274.7400000000002s)]
*  Like he's going to launch himself. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3278.5800000000004s)]
*  If you look at where he punches him, he punches him so high up in the air. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3281.06s)]
*  So he knew where his head was going to be. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3284.6600000000003s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3286.26s)]
*  Look how high he is. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3287.26s)]
*  See it? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3288.26s)]
*  He's ducked down and Orlovsky's way up in the air and he catches him perfectly on the [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3289.26s)]
*  chin. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3292.7000000000003s)]
*  Like that is just an understanding of positioning and where a guy's going to be and what the [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3293.7000000000003s)]
*  timing of your punches. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3298.78s)]
*  This is reminding me of the way Roger Federer would notice his opponent would quarter of [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3300.1000000000004s)]
*  an inch, open up his grip on the run and Roger would know forehand slice is coming, I'll [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3307.26s)]
*  sneak in and pop. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3311.98s)]
*  And now it's much different sport obviously. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3312.98s)]
*  But it's reading... [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3315.2200000000003s)]
*  Just the grip. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3316.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah dude, if you just typically he does it like this and this time he's doing it tiny, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3317.2200000000003s)]
*  boom, they go. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3320.78s)]
*  What's so different about tennis obviously is then you just volleyball for a winner. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3322.94s)]
*  It's 15 love. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3326.6600000000003s)]
*  You don't get head kicked. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3327.6600000000003s)]
*  You don't get fucking knocked out. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3328.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean this is why this shit fascinates me. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3329.6600000000003s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3334.0600000000004s)]
*  The consequences are so great that people look at it as a barbaric, horrific thing which [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3335.86s)]
*  is valid. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3341.02s)]
*  I understand why pacifists and people are very peaceful, don't want to have anything [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3342.02s)]
*  to do with violence. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3345.2999999999997s)]
*  I get it. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3346.62s)]
*  But what it is to me is the ultimate problem solving. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3348.02s)]
*  It's problem solving. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3352.82s)]
*  You have a person in front of you that is doing all of these things to try to throw [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3353.82s)]
*  you off. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3358.7s)]
*  They're fainting you, they're moving, they're switching stances, they're shooting in for [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3359.7s)]
*  takedowns that they don't want so they can catch you with a punch on the way in. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3363.02s)]
*  There's so many variables you have to think about. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3366.42s)]
*  So it's just like high level problem solving with dire physical consequences. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3368.66s)]
*  I love sport because it teaches life lessons with very low stakes. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3373.62s)]
*  But in these sports there's high stakes. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3381.18s)]
*  That's very interesting for me because I would much rather my kid play soccer or tennis, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3384.54s)]
*  learn some important lessons with low stakes. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3389.02s)]
*  But this type of thing, that is serious stakes. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3391.54s)]
*  It is serious stakes. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3395.46s)]
*  I think kids, especially boys, should all learn how to fight so they don't ever fight. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3396.66s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3401.94s)]
*  I as a 45 year old grown man, I wish I would have learned how to fight. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3402.94s)]
*  And I think it's probably not too late. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3406.82s)]
*  It's not too late. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3408.3s)]
*  You know you got a gym over here. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3409.3s)]
*  Yeah I was telling you, you could get into jujitsu, you'd be great at it. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3410.3s)]
*  You have long limbs, you're athletic. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3412.5s)]
*  Long limbs are huge for jujitsu because there's certain things that you'll be able to catch [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3415.18s)]
*  that other people can't catch with shorter limbs like a Darce choke. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3420.1s)]
*  So a Darce choke is, so say if you come to grab me and you have your head here and your [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3423.2400000000002s)]
*  arm wraps around me like this, I can shove my arm under like this, go off the side of [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3428.5s)]
*  your neck and clamp it like this and I've got you in a wicked choke. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3436.62s)]
*  It's called a Darce choke. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3440.9s)]
*  Oh shit, the Darce choke. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3441.9s)]
*  You will be way better at that than me because you have an extra six inches that you could [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3442.9s)]
*  seal this thing up. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3447.52s)]
*  So your hand will go further than mine, you'll be able to grab it deeper than I can. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3449.24s)]
*  Dude I'm writing down Darce choke. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3453.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3455.3999999999996s)]
*  And what I'll do tonight on my YouTube is I'll watch some Darce chokes. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3456.3999999999996s)]
*  And then you do it the other way, it's an anaconda. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3460.08s)]
*  So you either go armpit this way, it's a Darce, or you go head this way, armpit that way, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3463.24s)]
*  it's an anaconda. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3469.24s)]
*  And with the anaconda you roll like an anaconda and you squeeze them deeper into the choke. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3470.3399999999997s)]
*  And I just squeeze until the referee says it's over. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3474.7s)]
*  And your long legs, you could wrap around their body to secure them in place. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3477.16s)]
*  You could grab a hold of one of their legs so they can't turn away from you. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3481.2599999999998s)]
*  You can turn into them and fucking keep the squeeze on. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3484.56s)]
*  Dude you'd be wicked at it. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3487.68s)]
*  And in a competition that happens until the ref calls it or do I go? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3489.0s)]
*  Or the person taps out most of the time. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3493.08s)]
*  Most of the time you tap out because you know it's over. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3495.04s)]
*  You know it's over. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3497.44s)]
*  If you're a psycho you go to sleep. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3498.5s)]
*  And there are a lot of psychos just like people choke them unconscious. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3500.42s)]
*  That happens all the time. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3503.3199999999997s)]
*  Guys just say fuck it, I'm gonna get choked unconscious and they just go out. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3504.3199999999997s)]
*  And then the referee stops you. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3507.24s)]
*  Hopefully. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3509.48s)]
*  Hopefully. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3510.48s)]
*  Hopefully. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3511.48s)]
*  But sometimes the referees miss it and sometimes someone's out for like seconds while someone's [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3512.48s)]
*  still fucking squeezing the shit out of their neck. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3515.2s)]
*  And then the referee finally figures it out. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3517.7599999999998s)]
*  The person's like in the shadow realm. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3519.7999999999997s)]
*  I do absolutely love that in these sports there's this extreme violence, high stakes [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3522.2s)]
*  but then also a simple tap is a mutual agreement. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3529.2799999999997s)]
*  100%. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3533.6s)]
*  That's fucking awesome. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3534.6s)]
*  If you don't stop when someone taps you will get kicked out of the sport. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3535.6s)]
*  There's a guy named Hussamar Paul Harris who is one of the scariest motherfuckers to ever [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3539.44s)]
*  fight because he was a leg lock specialist. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3543.36s)]
*  And what he would do is rip your knees apart. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3546.08s)]
*  And he wouldn't let go when he tapped. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3548.68s)]
*  And he got kicked out of the UFC for it. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3550.88s)]
*  Because he did it to so many people. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3552.36s)]
*  He was known for not letting go. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3553.7599999999998s)]
*  And these guys would be screaming in agony and slapping and tapping. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3556.12s)]
*  And he would be still twisting. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3560.8399999999997s)]
*  He was built like a human pit bull. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3562.64s)]
*  He was like 5'7", 185 pounds of solid muscle. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3565.48s)]
*  And he would just dive on your legs and roll into these positions and rip your knees apart. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3569.96s)]
*  Like with a heel hook, a heel hook is so terrible because your knee has a lot of strength going [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3576.28s)]
*  forward and backwards but it has almost none going side to side. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3582.2s)]
*  So they isolate the top of it with their legs. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3585.58s)]
*  They wrap the heel into the crook of their elbow and then they wrench that motherfucker [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3588.28s)]
*  apart. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3593.8s)]
*  He's literally twisting your knee apart and it's terrifying. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3595.1200000000003s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3597.7200000000003s)]
*  And he cripples people. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3598.7200000000003s)]
*  Like you are fucked. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3600.1600000000003s)]
*  He'll tear your ACL, your MCL, your meniscus. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3601.4s)]
*  You're going to go a whole year before you can fight again. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3604.8s)]
*  You're going to have to get surgery to reconstruct your knee. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3607.2200000000003s)]
*  And then your knee is never going to be the same because your meniscus is shot now. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3609.84s)]
*  And maybe some of your cartilage. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3612.96s)]
*  So this is him. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3613.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3614.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3615.96s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3616.96s)]
*  So this is a fight that he had against David Avalon. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3617.96s)]
*  And this is fucked because they stop the motion and they put him back into the same position. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3620.6s)]
*  And when they put him back into the same position, he doesn't let go. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3626.48s)]
*  So he holds on to the heel hook and just wrenches the fucking shit out. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3630.2s)]
*  Like this right here. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3634.2999999999997s)]
*  Ah! [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3635.2999999999997s)]
*  He let go there. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3636.2999999999997s)]
*  He let go there because I think they were like chastising him to make sure. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3637.2999999999997s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3640.0s)]
*  Look at what he does. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3641.0s)]
*  I don't want to look. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3642.0s)]
*  Look at the build on this guy. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3643.0s)]
*  Paul Horace was a fucking specimen. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3644.0s)]
*  And he's trying to turn the knee sideways. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3646.68s)]
*  He's ripping this shit apart right here, man. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3648.64s)]
*  He's pulling it backwards. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3651.08s)]
*  It's backwards and at a slight angle. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3653.12s)]
*  I mean, this is horrific. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3655.2s)]
*  And look at the build on Paul Horace. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3656.2s)]
*  Imagine the fucking force, the size of this guy's legs, the size of his torso and perfect [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3658.92s)]
*  technique. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3664.16s)]
*  And he's just ripping his fucking knee apart. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3665.16s)]
*  That's a nasty knee bar right there. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3668.04s)]
*  That's so horrible to watch. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3669.88s)]
*  But in MMA, he wound up getting kicked out of the UFC because I think it was Mike Pierce. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3672.04s)]
*  See if you can find the Mike Pierce fight. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3677.96s)]
*  It might not have been Pierce. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3679.48s)]
*  I love that the tap. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3682.2799999999997s)]
*  Generally speaking, it does. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3685.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3686.0s)]
*  But in this case, the Mike Pierce one, he's screaming and tapping and Paul Horace is still [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3687.0s)]
*  ripping it apart. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3691.0s)]
*  I mean, one of my favorite parts of tennis is how they'll battle for five and a half [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3692.0s)]
*  hours and then they calmly walk through. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3695.16s)]
*  So here it is. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3697.12s)]
*  Look. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3698.12s)]
*  He's tapping. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3699.12s)]
*  Watch. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3700.12s)]
*  So he gets it. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3701.12s)]
*  He's tapping and he won't let go. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3702.12s)]
*  And he's still, when the referee's on him, he's still yanked on it. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3703.12s)]
*  So that extra second will just rip your shit apart. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3706.12s)]
*  So he taps immediately. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3710.8199999999997s)]
*  See none of this has to happen. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3712.04s)]
*  He was tapping immediately. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3713.94s)]
*  I feel like the ref was on that. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3715.44s)]
*  I know, but it's like Paul Horace doesn't give a fuck. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3717.24s)]
*  He's out for blood. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3719.6s)]
*  I mean, he had like a crazy childhood. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3720.6s)]
*  He grew up on a farm with like no food. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3723.68s)]
*  Like he's feral. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3725.96s)]
*  He's feral. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3728.96s)]
*  And he's super technical. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3729.96s)]
*  Which would serve you, I'm sure. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3731.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3732.7999999999997s)]
*  Until you get kicked out of the sport. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3733.8s)]
*  You know, unfortunately. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3735.92s)]
*  It's incredibly violent, but also systematic in its understanding of the human body. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3737.52s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3747.5600000000004s)]
*  We're going to know that the knee doesn't go this way. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3748.5600000000004s)]
*  No, it's really, really technical. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3750.28s)]
*  All sports are like this actually. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3751.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3753.28s)]
*  I think all sports at the highest levels, they have to be like that because you only [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3754.28s)]
*  get so far with genetics and so far with natural speed and endurance. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3757.48s)]
*  There's certain aspects of it that require a careful, considered study. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3761.36s)]
*  And wouldn't you, if you know your opponent is a guy that likes to do the, wouldn't you [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3766.2400000000002s)]
*  then in your training work on defending that and also like making sure your knee can withstand [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3771.7200000000003s)]
*  more of that than normal? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3776.76s)]
*  You know, you're not going to be able to do that. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3778.08s)]
*  There's no special knee pill you can take. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3779.84s)]
*  You got to tap when you get into those positions and then you got to make sure that you don't [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3782.44s)]
*  get into those positions, which is the most important thing. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3785.8s)]
*  The tapping must be so humbling as a fighter because you've trained so hard, you want to [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3788.04s)]
*  win so badly and yet you have to do this thing. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3793.36s)]
*  You have to press the eject button. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3796.16s)]
*  Well hopefully you will tap because guys haven't tapped and they've gotten their arms broken [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3797.48s)]
*  in half and I've seen quite a few of those, including legends. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3800.98s)]
*  Like Frank Meir one time he tapped. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3804.7799999999997s)]
*  Too much pride you mean to tap? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3806.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3808.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3809.2799999999997s)]
*  Because he fought Antonio Nogueira who was another legend who was former heavyweight [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3810.2799999999997s)]
*  champion of pride and he caught him in a camora and snapped his upper arm and we watched his [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3813.48s)]
*  arm crack and then go limp and you could see where it was cracked up here. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3818.0s)]
*  Oh it was horrific. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3822.12s)]
*  That's terrible. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3823.68s)]
*  So hard to watch. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3824.68s)]
*  When you're commentating, are you present moment completely? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3825.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3831.32s)]
*  100%. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3832.32s)]
*  Locked in. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3833.32s)]
*  You're not thinking like, it's not like these baseball commentators were like I got a story [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3834.32s)]
*  I'll tell later. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3837.64s)]
*  No. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3838.64s)]
*  No. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3839.64s)]
*  Because it is that. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3840.64s)]
*  No. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3841.64s)]
*  Great. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3842.64s)]
*  Great. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3843.64s)]
*  Especially not while the actual fight is going on. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3844.64s)]
*  The actual fight is life and death. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3845.64s)]
*  You have to be locked in. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3846.64s)]
*  But Daniel Cormier, so there's like two color commentators, me and Daniel Cormier and there's [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3848.2799999999997s)]
*  John Anik who's the play by play guy. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3852.8799999999997s)]
*  Me and Daniel fuck around a lot. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3854.7599999999998s)]
*  We joke around a lot about stuff because he's like a fun guy. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3856.08s)]
*  But when things are serious, we're serious. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3859.74s)]
*  You have to be like, you know, this is like you're representing these people's hard work. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3862.2s)]
*  You're trying to like put words to. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3867.48s)]
*  I love that. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3869.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3870.3599999999997s)]
*  You have to be very serious about it. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3871.3599999999997s)]
*  Because the stakes are so high and it's wild though that people might know you if they're [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3873.26s)]
*  just being introduced to you as the commentator for that and maybe don't know the other stuff. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3878.98s)]
*  And what's confusing for sure. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3883.9s)]
*  But it's also like it's one of the things that I'm most impressed with by what you do [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3886.1000000000004s)]
*  is as someone that has this passion for tennis, I'm like, it's so cool how you dive into a [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3891.5800000000004s)]
*  completely different world. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3896.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3897.82s)]
*  And just can't apologize for it. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3898.82s)]
*  You can't wonder what other people think about it. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3900.2200000000003s)]
*  You just have to be yourself. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3902.66s)]
*  And I grew up a martial artist. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3904.3s)]
*  Martial arts is an enormous part of my life. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3907.1s)]
*  It's an enormous part of like how I became who I am. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3909.78s)]
*  So for me, like commentating on martial arts is normal. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3912.92s)]
*  You're not a comedian who then switched over to martial arts because it served you. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3916.14s)]
*  It's your foundation of who you are and you also happen to be a comedian and podcast host. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3920.7s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm not interested in being funny. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3924.74s)]
*  I'm just trying to do that. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3926.9s)]
*  Like I've done commentary on Professional Pool too. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3928.26s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3930.42s)]
*  Because I play pool. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3931.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3932.62s)]
*  And I play pretty good. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3933.62s)]
*  So I really understand the game and I know what's going on. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3934.62s)]
*  So I've done commentary on that too. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3936.7400000000002s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3938.1s)]
*  What's your favorite pool movie? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3939.26s)]
*  The Hustler. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3940.7000000000003s)]
*  The Hustler. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3941.7000000000003s)]
*  The only answer to that question is the Hustler. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3942.7000000000003s)]
*  I thought the Color of Money had a run. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3944.94s)]
*  It's okay. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3947.42s)]
*  It's okay. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3948.42s)]
*  The Color of Money is good. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3949.42s)]
*  It's a good tournament movie. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3950.42s)]
*  It's a good movie. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3951.42s)]
*  But it's, you know, there's some things in it and because Paul Newman was in it, you [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3952.42s)]
*  kind of gave it some validity because it was the same Walter Tevis novel as The Hustler. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3956.2999999999997s)]
*  The Color of Money was very different. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3962.54s)]
*  The book was very different though. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3964.14s)]
*  But yeah, The Color of Money was great because it got a lot of people playing pool again. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3966.02s)]
*  But The Hustler is just an amazing film. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3969.42s)]
*  Like the actual film itself is amazing. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3973.12s)]
*  It's like Piper Laurie is incredible in it. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3975.62s)]
*  It's just, George C. Scott is in it. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3979.02s)]
*  Jackie Gleason plays Minnesota Fats. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3982.7799999999997s)]
*  By the way, Jackie Gleason was a real pool player. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3984.74s)]
*  He's probably the only guy that's ever played a pool player in a movie that really could [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3988.22s)]
*  play. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3991.62s)]
*  My brother once got a book for Christmas called How to Hustle Your Friends a Pool. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3992.7s)]
*  It was in our basement. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3998.14s)]
*  We had a pool table. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=3999.14s)]
*  But it was one of those things, same, that I worked at it. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4000.14s)]
*  I could never get it right. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4003.7799999999997s)]
*  And eventually other things came more naturally to me. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4005.7799999999997s)]
*  But it is fun. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4008.04s)]
*  Pool is something if you really want to play right, you have to get coached. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4009.14s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4012.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4013.18s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4014.2599999999998s)]
*  It's like you can develop some bad habits and bad fundamentals that you're never going [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4015.2599999999998s)]
*  to pass a certain level of play. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4020.2599999999998s)]
*  But I think it's like everything. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4023.5s)]
*  I think it's like chess, it's like tennis, it's like, you know, Schultz was in here the [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4024.74s)]
*  other day and he's into the sport paddle. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4028.52s)]
*  Have you seen paddle? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4030.18s)]
*  Is this P-A-D-E-L? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4031.54s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4032.54s)]
*  Padel? [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4033.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4034.54s)]
*  Oh, is it Padel? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4035.54s)]
*  Well, I've heard Padel. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4036.54s)]
*  It depends on how pretentious you want to be. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4037.54s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4038.54s)]
*  Of course. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4039.54s)]
*  Or if you're Spanish. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4040.54s)]
*  Oh, if you're Spanish. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4041.54s)]
*  Oh, did they say Padel? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4042.54s)]
*  Oh, well, why don't we call it Padel then? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4043.9s)]
*  Because Schultz said that's what it's called. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4045.9s)]
*  He said paddle. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4047.9s)]
*  Like he's from fucking, like a New Yorker. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4048.9s)]
*  Yeah, so, you know, tennis has had this great historical run on elite racket sports and [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4050.9s)]
*  then pickleball has been this counter response to tennis. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4057.46s)]
*  Silly ball, loud noise, don't really have to move much. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4063.74s)]
*  And pickleball has been taking off. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4069.98s)]
*  I don't know if you've played or if you've seen this. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4071.42s)]
*  Rock plays every day. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4073.74s)]
*  Okay, perfect. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4074.74s)]
*  He gets up at eight in the morning and plays pickleball with his trainer. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4075.74s)]
*  That is exactly my point. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4077.8199999999997s)]
*  Okay? [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4080.06s)]
*  I was in Scottsdale, Arizona recently. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4081.06s)]
*  I did an hour of pickleball. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4082.58s)]
*  The community there had music going, cracking beers. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4085.06s)]
*  Costa, come over, play with us. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4087.7799999999997s)]
*  Very, very fun. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4089.2999999999997s)]
*  Very fun. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4090.2999999999997s)]
*  I then go over to the other side and play tennis, which is my sport. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4091.2999999999997s)]
*  And no joke, this older couple says, you're talking too loudly on the courts, right? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4094.5s)]
*  It's this beautiful dichotomy of these two sports. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4098.74s)]
*  I don't know if pickleball is a sport. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4101.7s)]
*  But, padel comes along and seems to be this middle ground. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4103.42s)]
*  What I don't like about pickleball is you get to what they call the kitchen line and [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4109.9800000000005s)]
*  you can't move anymore. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4114.78s)]
*  You're frozen. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4115.82s)]
*  So you just stand there frozen and you knock the ball around. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4116.82s)]
*  I like a sport, I want 360 degree movement. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4120.46s)]
*  I don't want the dimensions of the court to restrict my movement or the rules of the game. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4124.18s)]
*  Padel seems to be both. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4128.74s)]
*  It's tennis, but it's in this box and they sometimes run outside of the box. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4130.02s)]
*  It's fucking insane. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4135.1s)]
*  I've actually never played, but the points never end because you're on this. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4136.660000000001s)]
*  I just see people blowing their ACOs out. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4144.02s)]
*  He's going outside the box. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4146.02s)]
*  I know, that's nuts. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4147.02s)]
*  That is nuts. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4148.02s)]
*  So it almost seems gimmicky to me. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4150.18s)]
*  That's funny that Andrew plays, but I would like to play this. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4152.02s)]
*  Also, one of the best things that happened for racket sports is HDTV. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4157.94s)]
*  When you were a kid watching Jimmy Connors, John Mackey, you never even see the fucking [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4161.54s)]
*  ball. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4166.74s)]
*  It was the same color as the court. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4167.74s)]
*  This shit now is unbelievable to watch. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4169.54s)]
*  That's like what they've done with hockey where they highlight the puck. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4171.419999999999s)]
*  I love that shit. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4173.94s)]
*  That's a game changer. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4174.94s)]
*  Now I know what's going on. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4175.94s)]
*  At first people made fun of it. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4176.94s)]
*  I was like, I need to ... And in hockey with the substitutions on the fly, I never know [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4177.94s)]
*  who the fuck's on the ice. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4182.74s)]
*  I love that though. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4184.339999999999s)]
*  I love that they do that. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4185.379999999999s)]
*  That's so cool. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4186.54s)]
*  I've been watching professional lacrosse lately. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4187.54s)]
*  Once I realized they could beat the fuck out of each other. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4189.34s)]
*  I didn't know that they could fight like they do in hockey. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4191.54s)]
*  I didn't know they could fight. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4194.54s)]
*  They fight and they wear shoes, which is crazy because now you're bare knuckle boxing in [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4195.54s)]
*  the middle of a game. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4200.06s)]
*  What does the shoes have to do with it? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4201.06s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4202.06s)]
*  Get grip. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4203.06s)]
*  Oh, you mean like a cleated shoe. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4204.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4205.06s)]
*  Well, the difference between running around on ice skates, you're sliding around. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4206.06s)]
*  The fighting is like, yeah, they're fighting, but they're kind of compromised because they [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4208.34s)]
*  can't really ... Good skaters can kind of hold ... It's not like having grip with your [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4211.18s)]
*  shoes and being able to really ... You can really hurt people. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4216.42s)]
*  They're beating the shit out of each other. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4219.7s)]
*  I'm like, wow. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4220.9800000000005s)]
*  Lacrosse always kind of had the like douchey rich kid sport, but it is incredibly ... Yeah, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4222.9800000000005s)]
*  but this ... They stopped doing this in the 90s. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4229.14s)]
*  They did? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4230.66s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say, they stopped doing this. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4231.66s)]
*  I don't watch hockey. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4232.66s)]
*  But I like this. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4233.66s)]
*  My favorite was ... I love they put a circle around it when it flies around. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4234.86s)]
*  It got a lot of pushback, but I always enjoyed it. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4239.9s)]
*  They don't do that. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4242.42s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4243.42s)]
*  Sorry hockey people. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4244.42s)]
*  I was double checking. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4245.42s)]
*  I don't think they do. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4246.42s)]
*  I might show it sometimes for the highlight, but it doesn't do that. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4247.42s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4248.42s)]
*  I always avoided winter sports when I was a kid. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4249.42s)]
*  I didn't learn how to ski until I was in my 40s, and I never learned how to ice skate [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4251.7s)]
*  because I was fighting all the time. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4255.9s)]
*  I didn't want to do anything that would hurt myself doing it. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4257.66s)]
*  So everybody was like, we're going to go skiing. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4260.06s)]
*  I was like, uh-uh. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4261.86s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4262.86s)]
*  I need these. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4263.86s)]
*  These are super important to me. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4264.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4265.86s)]
*  This got everybody excited though a few weeks ago though. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4266.86s)]
*  What are they doing? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4267.86s)]

*  There's nine fights in three points for five seconds. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4270.66s)]
*  They just started squaring off. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4273.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4274.42s)]
*  Why are we upset at Canada? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4275.42s)]
*  This is stupid. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4276.42s)]
*  Is this over tariffs? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4277.42s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4278.42s)]
*  100%. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4279.42s)]
*  They booed us over tariffs. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4280.42s)]
*  They were also trying to get, I mean, it worked. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4281.42s)]
*  They got a ton of attention. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4283.14s)]
*  So everyone was. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4284.14s)]
*  Who's red and who's blue? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4285.14s)]
*  Well, Canada's red. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4286.42s)]
*  There you go. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4287.42s)]
*  Who's winning this exchange? [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4288.42s)]
*  Red, white, and blue is America. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4289.42s)]
*  One dude keeps his helmet on. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4292.42s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4293.7s)]
*  That helmet's a problem. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4294.7s)]
*  Yeah, they punch through it. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4295.7s)]
*  I do love when you hear their microphones during a fight and they fight and then they go like, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4296.7s)]
*  you ready to be done? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4299.42s)]
*  Yeah, I'm ready to be done. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4300.42s)]
*  I love that. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4301.42s)]
*  I was at the comic strip in Edmonton years ago when Canada played US in the gold medal [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4302.42s)]
*  game. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4308.58s)]
*  Someone sent me the country's water usage during that game. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4310.42s)]
*  And at every period end, the water usage would go up because everyone would go to the bathroom. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4317.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4321.42s)]
*  And it was like the whole fucking country went to the bathroom at the same time. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4322.42s)]
*  And Canada won. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4326.7s)]
*  I think it was an overtime. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4327.9400000000005s)]
*  I was the only American there. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4328.9400000000005s)]
*  Man, do they love a good winter sport up there. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4330.46s)]
*  We got to become friends with Canada again. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4333.179999999999s)]
*  We have to like, you know, I'm down. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4334.919999999999s)]
*  This is so ridiculous. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4337.299999999999s)]
*  I can't believe that there's like anti-American and anti-Canadian sentiment going on. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4338.299999999999s)]
*  It's a dumbest fucking feud. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4342.98s)]
*  Is there anti? [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4343.98s)]
*  There it is. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4344.98s)]
*  That's nuts. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4345.98s)]
*  Look at the water consumption. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4346.98s)]
*  Is there? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4347.98s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4348.98s)]
*  Right when the bathrooms go. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4349.98s)]
*  I love on this pod where if I say something, I got to be ready for you guys to fact check [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4350.98s)]
*  my ass. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4353.62s)]
*  Jamie's ready. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4354.62s)]
*  Is there anti-Canadian sentiment? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4356.74s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of idiots that now think that they're our fucking enemy. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4358.54s)]
*  Why are we subsidizing Canada? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4362.42s)]
*  Welcome, they don't have their own military. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4364.38s)]
*  Well they don't. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4367.38s)]
*  So let's just like deal with it as it is. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4368.38s)]
*  You know, Trudeau is out, right? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4372.26s)]
*  He's already leaving. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4374.26s)]
*  I feel like... [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4375.26s)]
*  Yeah, they got a new guy who's just as bad. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4376.26s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4378.26s)]
*  But they got a new party. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4379.26s)]
*  150 people voted. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4380.26s)]
*  Now they have a new guy running the country. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4381.26s)]
*  But their whole election system is so different. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4383.9s)]
*  They don't have like a specific time when they have elections. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4386.82s)]
*  They can call an election and I think it happens within three weeks. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4389.98s)]
*  The whole thing is so crazy. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4393.34s)]
*  And so I don't know what's happening with their politics, but I just want America and [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4394.54s)]
*  Canada to get along. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4397.94s)]
*  I think it's ridiculous. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4398.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4399.94s)]
*  It's a good... [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4400.94s)]
*  As someone who's from Ann Arbor, Michigan, you know... [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4401.94s)]
*  I don't really think they should be our 51st state. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4403.3s)]
*  There I said it. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4405.74s)]
*  There you said it? [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4406.74s)]
*  It's on record. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4407.74s)]
*  It would be fun if it happened. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4408.74s)]
*  It would be fun. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4410.74s)]
*  I think Greenland's more accessible. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4411.74s)]
*  You could probably buy that. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4412.74s)]
*  If you want a 51st state, it's Greenland. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4413.74s)]
*  Plus, if global warming is real because of all the digging and oil and all that shit, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4415.7s)]
*  you know, it'd be good to have a cold spot to eventually warm up. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4421.3s)]
*  I just read this crazy book called Power Metals by Vince Beiser, possibly. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4424.7s)]
*  We had him on the show, Daily Show. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4431.3s)]
*  And it's all about like minerals and metals and what we need for our batteries and cobalt [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4433.0599999999995s)]
*  mining in Africa. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4437.5s)]
*  And I went down to all this YouTube shit with like the child labor and all. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4438.5s)]
*  But I was very ignorant to how much we need and use metals. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4444.98s)]
*  Nickel, copper, you know, wild batteries, EVs, everything. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4448.58s)]
*  And so then when the news came out that Trump wanted Greenland, I was like, oh, this is [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4454.379999999999s)]
*  starting to make more sense to me now. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4458.259999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff up there. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4459.62s)]
*  There's also a lot of stuff in the sky. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4461.0199999999995s)]
*  If they can mine asteroids, if they can successfully figure out how to mine asteroids, they can [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4463.639999999999s)]
*  get a lot of precious minerals. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4467.179999999999s)]
*  Let's fucking do that. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4469.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's a few decades away. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4470.179999999999s)]
*  But they'll figure it out eventually. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4473.22s)]
*  They've been able to get samples from asteroids and they know like what the composites are. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4474.9400000000005s)]
*  And, you know, there's asteroids out there that are filled with trillions of dollars [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4480.26s)]
*  in minerals. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4483.18s)]
*  That is fucking nuts. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4484.66s)]
*  I know it's nuts. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4485.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4486.66s)]
*  And they can figure it out. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4487.66s)]
*  They will. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4488.66s)]
*  They'll eventually figure it out. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4489.66s)]
*  But I had said Darth Kara on who has done he's done some pretty brilliant and brave investigative [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4490.66s)]
*  work on the cobalt mines. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4497.54s)]
*  He took video of these what they call artisanal mines. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4500.219999999999s)]
*  It's essentially slaves digging this stuff out of the ground with their babies on their [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4503.82s)]
*  back. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4508.66s)]
*  This is from Siddharth's book. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4509.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4510.66s)]
*  I mean, this is fucking crazy. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4511.66s)]
*  And they're digging the cobalt out of the ground with like literally with sticks. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4513.179999999999s)]
*  Everybody's breathing it in. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4517.58s)]
*  It's all toxic. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4518.58s)]
*  These women have babies on their back. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4519.58s)]
*  The babies are breathing it in. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4521.0199999999995s)]
*  And then there's these pools, right, that you put the water and it's toxic water and [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4522.58s)]
*  the pools are different colors. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4528.74s)]
*  And we don't know where this goes and the water seeps in. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4530.98s)]
*  And is this also I can get the new iPhone 14 Max or whatever the fuck it is? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4533.78s)]
*  100 percent. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4537.82s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4538.82s)]
*  It's terrible. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4539.82s)]
*  It's the only way we're getting that stuff. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4540.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4542.34s)]
*  That's most of the cobalt's coming from that area. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4543.34s)]
*  And it's it's also then you go to the actual construction of the phone itself and you see [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4544.98s)]
*  those factories, those Foxconn factories, or they have nets around them to keep people [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4550.28s)]
*  from jumping off the roofs. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4554.32s)]

*  So why have a company like Apple that's worth more than any corporation ever? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4571.38s)]
*  Like Apple's insanely profitable. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4576.02s)]

*  All of the fertilization goes down to Lake Okeechobee then goes out to the oceans where [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4592.08s)]

*  I chew it all the time. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4819.68s)]

*  What's the goal? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4825.56s)]
*  Just to keep the brain energy high? [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4827.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4829.76s)]
*  You want to provide your brain with the nutrients your brain needs to produce human neurotransmitters. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4830.76s)]
*  I'm going to take this. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4835.92s)]
*  Maybe we'll do a before-after. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4837.72s)]
*  That's mine. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4839.52s)]
*  I usually take two when I take the mints. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4840.52s)]
*  They're legit. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4843.8s)]
*  This is one. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4844.8s)]
*  Neuro gum is another one. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4845.8s)]
*  True brain is another one that I've tried. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4847.0s)]
*  It's really good. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4848.72s)]
*  It's like little packets you drink. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4849.72s)]
*  I just assumed it was kids and age and getting older that I'll lose my train of thought more [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4852.72s)]

*  Writing a joke. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4862.0s)]
*  It's not fun. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4863.0s)]
*  Everything I read says keep exercising, get blood flow in your body, maybe sauna helps. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4865.84s)]
*  Sleep is a big one. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4871.64s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4878.2s)]

*  would get in because he wanted a float tank situation. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4887.24s)]

*  Sleep is a big problem. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4911.34s)]
*  You really need to get a solid seven, eight hours of sleep every night. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4913.1s)]

*  I take it every day. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4927.24s)]
*  I took it in college. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4928.24s)]
*  The strength team coach made me take it and it bothered my stomach. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4929.48s)]
*  Well, there's different forms of creatine. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4933.36s)]
*  I take it in gummy form, which doesn't seem to bother me at all. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4936.32s)]
*  I've had people that take it like liquid, they pour it into water and they get diarrhea. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=4939.2s)]

*  She also helped foster an environment of creativity and of collaboration. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5195.4s)]
*  It was a home for a lot of road comics. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5203.6s)]
*  There was this thing that you knew that you would go home and on Tuesday and Wednesday [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5209.64s)]
*  nights we would be at the store having the time of our lives. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5213.200000000001s)]

*  We would be doing sets. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5219.6s)]
*  We would be laughing together. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5220.6s)]
*  Everybody's cracking jokes in the parking lot. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5221.6s)]
*  It was so much fun. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5223.52s)]
*  It was that home environment that we wanted to recreate as much as possible. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5225.68s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5230.8s)]
*  I think it's as comic friendly as public. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5232.0s)]
*  What have you ever wanted in a club that they didn't have? [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5234.68s)]
*  Okay, let's get that. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5236.76s)]
*  How do you want this to be ... How do you want to get to the stage? [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5238.400000000001s)]
*  What do you think we need to do the best? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5240.92s)]
*  I asked everybody and Louis CK gave me some of the best advice. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5241.92s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5244.360000000001s)]
*  Louis told me to lower the ceilings. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5245.360000000001s)]
*  I shortened the stage in the smaller room. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5246.360000000001s)]
*  He told me to deaden the sound as much as possible. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5248.96s)]
*  Everybody wants that echo because it makes it sound like people are killing more. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5252.360000000001s)]
*  You want clear sound. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5255.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5256.16s)]
*  He was dead right on everything. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5257.16s)]
*  Wow. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5258.16s)]
*  Because he has a production mind. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5259.16s)]
*  He doesn't just have a mind of a comic. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5260.36s)]
*  He also has a mind of what's the best way to set things up for a film or set the environment. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5262.44s)]
*  You feel and notice all that stuff on stage. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5270.12s)]
*  I was performing recently, ceilings tall, crowd is full, but where's the laughs going? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5272.719999999999s)]
*  Am I killing? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5280.719999999999s)]
*  I feel like I'm doing well, but I'm not hearing it. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5281.719999999999s)]
*  Now I'm in my head a little bit. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5284.44s)]
*  That's changed my order. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5286.5599999999995s)]
*  Now I'm doing the bit that I know is going to kill instead of just letting things and [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5288.2s)]
*  it's like all of that matters. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5291.84s)]
*  All of that matters. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5294.16s)]
*  High ceilings is a big thing. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5295.16s)]
*  It's a problem. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5296.16s)]
*  You want to be locked in. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5297.16s)]
*  I want everybody to be locked in. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5298.16s)]
*  The Comedy Store, the way you just described that, really became my clubhouse. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5300.16s)]
*  I got past there when you were gone for a little while. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5306.08s)]
*  I remember when you came back, it changed dramatically. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5313.12s)]
*  LA was really, really tough for me initially upon moving there. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5317.04s)]
*  All of a sudden you get into a place like that. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5320.32s)]
*  There's a place to drink. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5322.16s)]
*  There's a place to talk shit. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5323.68s)]
*  There's a place to, oh my God, even just parking. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5324.68s)]
*  Park here and then just hang. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5329.12s)]
*  It changed the game. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5331.58s)]
*  It changed the game for me. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5332.78s)]
*  It changed the game for all of us. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5333.78s)]
*  The improv was always a great club to perform at. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5337.04s)]
*  I always performed there. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5338.92s)]
*  Laugh Factory's fun. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5340.08s)]
*  But there's something about the store that was home base. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5341.4s)]
*  The idea of doing something like that in Texas, Ron White was the first guy to open my eyes [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5345.2s)]
*  to it because Ron had moved here before the pandemic. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5350.16s)]
*  Ron's like, it's in the middle of country. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5353.76s)]
*  I don't have to fucking fly for six hours. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5355.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like the place is great. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5357.8s)]
*  Food's nice. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5359.48s)]
*  People are cool. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5360.48s)]
*  I'm like, fuck, can I live in Texas? [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5361.48s)]
*  I always wanted to get out of LA. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5362.48s)]
*  Especially when my kids were young, I was like, I've been through this with my older [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5363.48s)]
*  daughter. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5367.36s)]
*  I was like, I don't think LA's a good place for children. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5368.36s)]
*  I don't think it's a good place for young people. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5370.04s)]
*  I think it's just filled with too many bizarre ambitions and creeps. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5371.88s)]
*  People are devalued because there's so many of them. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5379.56s)]
*  It's too overwhelming. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5382.2s)]
*  I'd always thought about getting out. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5384.84s)]
*  Then the pandemic hit. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5386.84s)]
*  Then Ron White was the one who talked me into opening up the club. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5388.04s)]
*  We were doing local shows at the Vulcan. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5390.84s)]
*  We had talked about maybe opening up a club. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5393.12s)]
*  Maybe we should buy a club here. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5395.4800000000005s)]
*  Ron White got off stage. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5397.72s)]
*  He hadn't been on stage in seven or eight months. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5399.0s)]

*  Turned out he was playing it off. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5404.6s)]
*  He had practiced all day, gone over his notes. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5406.040000000001s)]
*  He's just fucking professional. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5408.040000000001s)]
*  Just murdered. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5409.64s)]
*  Then he grabs me by the shoulders. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5410.64s)]
*  He goes, whatever the fuck we have to do, we're going to keep doing this. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5411.64s)]
*  You're going to open up that goddamn club. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5414.84s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5416.6s)]
*  Always a great hang. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5419.52s)]
*  He's the best. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5420.52s)]
*  At the Comedy Store, he didn't know me. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5421.52s)]
*  He would just hang. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5422.64s)]

*  He's the elder statesman of the Austin comedy scene. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5425.400000000001s)]
*  He's the best. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5428.52s)]
*  He's such a good guy. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5429.52s)]
*  He's always around. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5430.68s)]
*  With Ron, we had Ron, we had Tony Hinchcliffe, and then Tom Segura moved here, and Christina [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5431.68s)]

*  The Comedy Store had to lose guys like Adam. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5455.96s)]
*  They had to fire everybody. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5458.4400000000005s)]

*  Does nobody ever do anything unusual? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5505.4800000000005s)]
*  We just fucking do it. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5506.4800000000005s)]
*  Everyone just always either goes to New York or LA and that's it forever. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5507.4800000000005s)]
*  It was also, we had so many people like Brian Simpson. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5510.4800000000005s)]
*  He moved out here early. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5513.4800000000005s)]
*  Derek Post and Asana Ma. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5514.4800000000005s)]
*  They all moved out here early. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5515.4800000000005s)]
*  We had so many killers that were already here. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5517.24s)]
*  We were already doing shows, sold out shows at the Vulcan. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5520.799999999999s)]
*  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday nights. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5523.4s)]
*  Kill Tony was there on Mondays. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5525.16s)]
*  We were already doing weekend shows. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5526.16s)]
*  It was a no-brainer. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5529.0s)]
*  We knew we could do it. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5530.799999999999s)]
*  But it was a little scary. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5532.48s)]
*  It was a little scary. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5534.5199999999995s)]
*  Dump a bunch of money, buy a building, renovate the whole thing for a year and a half. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5535.919999999999s)]
*  The decisions alone? [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5540.679999999999s)]
*  It's a lot of decisions. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5541.959999999999s)]
*  A lot of decisions. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5543.719999999999s)]
*  Knob, carpets, lights, ceiling, drywall. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5544.96s)]
*  We had a really good architect that helped too. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5548.360000000001s)]
*  Shout out to Richard. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5549.84s)]
*  Richard Wise. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5550.84s)]
*  But at the end of the day, really what it was all about was a lot of great timing. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5551.84s)]
*  Great opportunity and great timing. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5556.64s)]
*  And then doing it the right way from the beginning. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5558.64s)]
*  Make it as comedy friendly as possible. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5561.400000000001s)]
*  And just make an environment where people like to be there. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5563.4800000000005s)]

*  Everybody's real supportive. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5571.2s)]
*  I love that. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5573.04s)]
*  In comics, to their credit, I think naturally are non-conformists and I love that they'll [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5574.36s)]
*  jump at a new opportunity. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5580.4s)]
*  They're not all tied. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5582.04s)]
*  So yeah, Joe's opening a club. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5584.12s)]
*  We'll go. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5587.68s)]
*  Boom. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5588.68s)]
*  Done. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5589.68s)]
*  And people move here. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5590.68s)]
*  It's nuts to hear. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5591.68s)]
*  I can't believe how often. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5592.68s)]
*  I was texting with Adam. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5593.68s)]
*  He said, who do you want to be opening for you this weekend? [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5594.68s)]
*  I said, send me some names. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5596.04s)]
*  Send me all the names. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5597.04s)]
*  I'm like, this feels like all comedy store names. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5598.04s)]
*  Holtzman lives there all the time. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5601.2s)]
*  He's here all the time. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5604.56s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5605.56s)]
*  He was fucking killing the other night. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5606.56s)]
*  Now Holtzman has a crowd here now. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5608.64s)]
*  So instead of Holtzman going up at two o'clock in the morning in the main room when there [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5611.16s)]
*  was no one there and the comics in the back of the room and laugh. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5614.64s)]
*  Now he's got sold out shows and people come to see Holtzman. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5617.8s)]
*  And he's doing different material like every nightmare. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5622.62s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5625.6s)]
*  He's got a crowd now and he can make money in town, which is huge. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5627.04s)]
*  He doesn't have to travel. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5632.16s)]
*  He doesn't have to do the road. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5633.16s)]
*  And he is doing the road a little bit too now, which is unique for Brian too. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5634.16s)]
*  It's really funny because he puts up these videos of people getting offended. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5638.16s)]
*  He does? [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5640.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5641.96s)]
*  On his Instagram is people getting offended and screaming him walking out of a show because [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5642.96s)]
*  they don't get it. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5646.280000000001s)]
*  But once you see him a couple of times and you get what he's doing, then we have what [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5648.320000000001s)]
*  we have in Austin now where people, you know, when Holtzman is there it sells out. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5652.12s)]
*  They're coming to see Holtzman. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5655.6s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5656.88s)]
*  There's nothing more beautiful than a person talking into a microphone, causing a reaction [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5657.88s)]
*  to a group. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5664.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5665.56s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5666.56s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5667.56s)]
*  It shows how powerful words and energy and communication can be. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5668.56s)]
*  It's like you let that person make you that mad. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5672.4400000000005s)]
*  This person didn't touch you or hit you. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5677.2s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5680.4800000000005s)]
*  That is wild to think that we have that ability. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5682.08s)]
*  Especially with Holtzman because he lets you in on it every now and then. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5685.6s)]
*  What he's doing. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5688.04s)]
*  Then he comes back to it. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5689.04s)]
*  He does this very beautiful dance of letting you in on it and then going right back to [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5691.84s)]
*  the fucking guy. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5696.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5697.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5698.320000000001s)]
*  Well, it's fucking great. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5699.320000000001s)]
*  I'm looking forward to performing there. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5700.320000000001s)]
*  So that's sweet. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5701.64s)]
*  You're going to have a good time, man. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5702.64s)]
*  Did you bring people to open with you or you got local people? [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5703.64s)]
*  I think we got local. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5705.96s)]
*  I'm not 100% sure but I didn't bring people with me. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5706.96s)]
*  We have a lot of good local people. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5709.400000000001s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5711.080000000001s)]
*  It's like you could bring somebody or you're in a community where there's great comedy. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5712.08s)]
*  So I'd much rather do that. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5716.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5718.32s)]
*  And you'll have a great hang. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5719.32s)]
*  The green room is really great. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5721.5199999999995s)]
*  It's a great hang. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5722.8s)]
*  We have Mae West's couch in there that Peter Schor gave me. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5724.16s)]
*  It's Mitsy's. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5728.48s)]
*  She had it in her house. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5729.48s)]
*  So we had it reupholstered. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5731.04s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5732.04s)]
*  So in the green room, this beautiful pink couch, that's Mae West's couch. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5733.04s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5736.44s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5737.44s)]
*  So the bones of it are Mae West's couch. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5738.44s)]
*  That's great. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5740.36s)]
*  And so we have Rodney Dangerfield's handwritten notes on the wall from his last Tonight Show [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5741.639999999999s)]
*  special. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5746.2s)]
*  So it's all the different bits that he wanted to hit and all the different things that he [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5747.2s)]
*  wanted to talk about. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5750.5599999999995s)]
*  And then Patrick Bette David gave me one of Lenny Bruce's microphones. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5751.599999999999s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5755.2s)]
*  So we have Lenny Bruce's microphone framed on the wall above the monitors. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5756.2s)]
*  I feel like Lenny Bruce, not enough comics understand the road he paved for everybody [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5761.599999999999s)]
*  else. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5771.639999999999s)]
*  It's known that he did that, but he was the OG. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5772.639999999999s)]
*  He's the OG. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5776.839999999999s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to say. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5777.839999999999s)]
*  He was the first guy to go to jail. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5779.679999999999s)]
*  He was going to jail. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5781.0s)]
*  He fucking arrested him. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5782.0s)]
*  A bunch of times. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5783.12s)]
*  That is insane. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5784.36s)]
*  For stuff that is nothing. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5785.48s)]
*  Today it would even get you kicked off TikTok. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5787.919999999999s)]
*  But we still had the First Amendment at that time. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5790.48s)]
*  So that's what's so interesting to me. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5792.32s)]
*  The interpretation of or the enforcement of has...that's wild. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5794.24s)]
*  This is the role... [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5798.959999999999s)]
*  Same constitution. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5799.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah, same constitution. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5800.959999999999s)]
*  Well, this is the role that comedy plays in free speech because we are really one of the [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5801.959999999999s)]
*  only countries that has the kind of free speech that we have, the declaration. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5808.5199999999995s)]
*  When we have the First Amendment, it talks very specifically, the very first one, about [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5813.32s)]
*  our ability to express ourselves, how important that is. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5819.44s)]
*  But if you're a comedian and you can't do that, like if someone's deciding what you [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5822.24s)]
*  get, well, that sets the boundaries for everything else. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5827.28s)]
*  If he didn't do that, if he wasn't doing that in the 50s and the 60s and getting arrested, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5829.679999999999s)]
*  like who knows where free speech would be today. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5835.44s)]
*  What was he arrested on? [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5839.08s)]
*  Profanity. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5840.679999999999s)]
*  You could be arrested on profanity? [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5841.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he was arrested on profanity charges. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5843.32s)]
*  Yeah, they had profanity laws back then. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5846.36s)]
*  In public places, you couldn't have...different places and different districts had different [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5849.08s)]
*  regulations. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5856.24s)]
*  But I'm sure in San Francisco, where he started, he probably could do whatever he wanted. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5857.24s)]
*  And then as you travel and you start...and then he became more and more popular. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5862.28s)]
*  Obscenity. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5866.4s)]
*  Obscenity. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5867.4s)]
*  This reminds me of... [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5868.4s)]
*  Profanity, obscenity. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5869.8s)]
*  So here it is. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5871.72s)]
*  He was arrested at the jazz workshop in San Francisco, which is even crazier, in 1961, [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5875.4s)]
*  where he used the word cocksucker and said that two is a preposition, cum is a verb, [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5879.5199999999995s)]
*  that the sexual context of cum was so common that it bore no weight and that if someone [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5887.2s)]
*  hearing it became upset, he probably can't cum. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5891.719999999999s)]
*  Although the jury acquitted him, other law enforcement agencies began monitoring his [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5894.799999999999s)]
*  appearances resulting in frequent arrests under obscenity charges. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5899.16s)]
*  Yeah, but Joe, see there, although a jury acquitted him, I'm just wondering, like, was [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5902.44s)]
*  he actually breaking a law or are they just hassling him by arresting him because he can't... [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5907.08s)]
*  Dude, they've arrested him for saying schmuck. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5911.759999999999s)]
*  Go back to that real quick. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5916.04s)]
*  But I'm saying, there's no...what do you charge somebody with? [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5917.04s)]
*  Well, this was the obscenity charges. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5920.4s)]
*  Like they said, if you go back to that Wikipedia page, look at that. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5923.32s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5926.839999999999s)]
*  He said, Sherman Block later became the county sheriff. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5927.88s)]
*  The charge this time was that the community used the word schmuck, an insulting Yiddish [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5931.84s)]
*  word that was also considered a term for penis. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5936.2s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5938.6s)]
*  The Hollywood charges were later dismissed. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5939.6s)]
*  So this was in Philadelphia and then Los Angeles and then West Hollywood. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5941.56s)]
*  In West Hollywood, he was arrested. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5946.96s)]
*  Imagine, the place where the Comedy Store resides right now. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5948.8s)]
*  He was arrested just 10 years before Richard Pryor was performing live in the Sunset Strip. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5951.52s)]
*  I mean, what about the... [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5956.64s)]
*  The one in Philly is legit. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5957.64s)]
*  The gay... [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5959.08s)]
*  What's that, Jamie? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5960.08s)]
*  The gay drug possession. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5961.08s)]
*  Yeah, he did a lot of drugs. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5962.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, I would do a lot of drugs if I got arrested every time I said schmuck. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5963.08s)]
*  So live in the Sunset Strip, I think was 81 or 82. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5966.72s)]
*  Is that correct? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5970.320000000001s)]
*  What year was live in the Sunset Strip? [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5971.400000000001s)]
*  Because I was in high school. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5973.52s)]
*  I remember that. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5974.76s)]
*  66. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5976.0s)]
*  I have that poster, that Lenny Bruce poster. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5977.0s)]
*  There's a lot of Lenny Bruce love out in that... [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5980.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5981.76s)]
*  Which is so cool. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5982.76s)]
*  Yeah, I have a lot of Lenny Bruce stuff out there. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5983.76s)]
*  Look, he was the guy. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5985.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's hard when you listen to his stuff today because most of it, it's kind of trite. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5987.0s)]
*  We've heard all the premises before. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5992.639999999999s)]
*  Because he broke the ground. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5994.32s)]
*  You have to remember, people were so innocent in 1961. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5995.679999999999s)]
*  The culture was so different that what he was saying was groundbreaking. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=5999.2s)]
*  I fell into that trap. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6002.679999999999s)]
*  I was like, I'm not really digging it. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6004.16s)]
*  I'm not enjoying it. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6006.5199999999995s)]
*  But it's like, you have to really think about where we were then. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6007.5199999999995s)]
*  Sure. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6010.96s)]
*  If you listen to Shakespeare talk, you'd probably... [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6011.96s)]
*  This guy's a retard. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6013.36s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6014.4s)]
*  What thou dost not. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6015.4s)]
*  Like, shut up. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6016.4s)]
*  But it's like, in the context of 1961, what he was doing was, it was akin to a lot of [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6017.839999999999s)]
*  things that were to come, like the anti-war movement, the civil rights movement. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6024.44s)]
*  All these things were bubbling up about this freedom of exploring ideas and expressing [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6028.32s)]
*  yourself. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6035.24s)]
*  But in comedy, it had just been two Jews walking to a bar. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6036.24s)]
*  It'd been jokes. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6039.04s)]
*  It was set up punchline. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6040.04s)]
*  The Italian says the Polish guy. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6041.16s)]
*  It would have been a lot of that stuff. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6042.92s)]
*  And so he came along and was like, why do we have these words that are forbidden? [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6044.4800000000005s)]
*  Why do we have this? [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6049.04s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6050.08s)]
*  Why can't people be in love this way? [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6051.08s)]
*  Why can't that happen? [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6053.04s)]
*  And it was like, people were like, Jesus, why can't we? [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6054.68s)]
*  And he changed the way people thought about life, not just about comedy. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6057.28s)]
*  And then I think Richard Pryor came along and made it way better. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6062.4s)]
*  Yeah, made it funnier. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6065.88s)]
*  But also what fascinates me so much about that with Lenny Bruce is it's the same first [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6066.92s)]
*  amendment that we have right today. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6072.76s)]
*  And those words have not changed, but society has or its interpretation has or its enforcement [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6076.08s)]
*  has. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6081.320000000001s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6082.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6083.320000000001s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6084.320000000001s)]
*  The enforcement is the thing. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6085.320000000001s)]
*  And then the concept of obscenity charges. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6086.320000000001s)]
*  Obscenity charges are very subjective. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6088.56s)]
*  Who's to decide what's obscene? [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6090.64s)]
*  To me, schmuck is not obscene. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6092.12s)]
*  It's kind of cute. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6093.360000000001s)]
*  If someone calls you a schmuck, it's probably a friend of yours. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6094.360000000001s)]
*  You fucking schmuck. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6097.68s)]
*  It's not a... [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6100.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, you get arrested for schmuck? [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6101.48s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6103.5199999999995s)]
*  What is this, Jamie? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6104.5199999999995s)]
*  This is where the obscenity law came from, a court case. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6105.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, this is 73, though. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6108.44s)]
*  This is what I typed in. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6109.44s)]
*  Where did the obscenity laws in San Francisco come from? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6110.44s)]
*  No, I understand. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6112.44s)]
*  But this is 73 because, you know, he was 61. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6113.44s)]
*  So what does it say there? [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6116.5s)]
*  The ruling? [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6117.5199999999995s)]
*  Scroll up by the top a little bit. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6118.5199999999995s)]
*  It says a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court clarifying the legal definition of obscenity [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6119.5599999999995s)]
*  as material that lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6123.679999999999s)]
*  The ruling was the origin of three-part judicial tests for determining obscene media content [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6129.36s)]
*  that could be banned by government authorities, which is now known as the Miller test. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6134.679999999999s)]
*  So here's the thing to think about this. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6138.24s)]
*  The Miller test is actually quite relevant right now. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6139.24s)]
*  It's coming up a lot. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6141.36s)]
*  Oh, is it? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6142.36s)]
*  Miller test, yes. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6143.36s)]
*  For what? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6144.36s)]
*  First Amendment stuff. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6145.36s)]
*  I just heard something about it. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6146.36s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6147.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it is interesting because the thing about this is this is probably all in response [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6148.799999999999s)]
*  to all the anti-war activists and all of the whole hippie freedom of speech flower child movement. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6154.02s)]
*  I did a piece for The Daily Show after Biden won and this woman in New Jersey had up 10, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6162.02s)]
*  15 flags. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6173.02s)]
*  Fuck Biden. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6174.02s)]
*  Fuck Joe Biden. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6175.02s)]
*  Fuck Joe Biden flags. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6176.02s)]
*  was on a path to a school and a lot of parents said, take down the flag. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6179.02s)]
*  She said, it's my First Amendment right. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6185.240000000001s)]
*  Got all messy. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6188.1s)]
*  The city made her take it down. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6189.68s)]
*  She refused. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6191.18s)]
*  NAACP popped in to defend her saying it was her right as a, Biden was a political figure, [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6192.18s)]
*  but then it became an obscenity. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6199.700000000001s)]
*  It was a very interesting piece. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6200.700000000001s)]
*  I spoke to her and she was very outspoken and my whole take was like, hey, just maybe let's [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6204.02s)]
*  say legally you can put those flags up, but it's just kind of shitty right. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6209.660000000001s)]
*  And she was like, fuck you, I'm gonna put my flags up. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6213.26s)]
*  But interesting when obscenity mixes in with school, kid. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6215.580000000001s)]
*  What is that now? [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6220.540000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6221.540000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6222.540000000001s)]
*  It's a public figure. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6223.540000000001s)]
*  Public figure. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6224.540000000001s)]
*  If it says fuck Tony, fuck Michael, that's different than fuck Joe Biden, the sitting [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6225.540000000001s)]
*  president of the United States. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6230.0s)]
*  All fascinating. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6231.620000000001s)]
*  It's also, it's like, what do you want to see in your neighborhood? [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6233.22s)]
*  I don't like people putting those fucking stupid signs on their lawns. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6237.14s)]
*  My parents, who are diehard liberals, they were living in Florida at the time. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6241.78s)]
*  And this is during 2016. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6246.66s)]
*  And my mom was complaining, every time I put my Hillary Clinton sign, someone takes it [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6249.34s)]
*  down. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6253.26s)]
*  I'm like, you're in Florida. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6254.26s)]
*  Why are you putting Hillary Clinton signs on your lawn? [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6255.26s)]
*  To my mom, it might as well be like she was supporting the Miami Dolphins. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6259.139999999999s)]
*  That was her team. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6263.099999999999s)]
*  Her team was the Democrats. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6264.099999999999s)]
*  Well, I was just going to say, I don't like when a kid is wearing a Dolphins hat or a [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6265.099999999999s)]
*  Yankees hat. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6270.38s)]
*  Because I'm like, we as adults have put that on the kid. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6271.38s)]
*  Well, maybe the kid is just a fan of the sport. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6274.82s)]
*  It's possible, but that probably made him do it. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6277.22s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6280.3s)]
*  Maybe the kid just likes it. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6281.3s)]
*  That doesn't bother me at all. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6282.3s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with supporting teams. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6283.3s)]
*  There's a real problem when it's how the whole country's run and you're thinking about it [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6285.679999999999s)]
*  like a team. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6289.44s)]
*  That's kind of ridiculous. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6290.44s)]
*  People that put those fucking signs on their lawn, settle down. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6293.0s)]
*  Just why? [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6296.44s)]
*  Why? [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6297.44s)]
*  Why are you doing it? [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6298.44s)]
*  It's just like you're like, right in the yard, right in the front of your house, reach a [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6299.44s)]
*  point. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6305.96s)]

*  Love is love. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6310.0s)]
*  Black lives matter. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6311.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6312.48s)]
*  Who was the Supreme Court Justice with the flags? [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6313.919999999999s)]
*  Got in the whole fucking neighborhood fight with the flags. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6316.04s)]
*  Had the white flag with the green pine tree on it. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6319.16s)]
*  And that was Christian nationalism or had ties to it, whatever. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6325.0s)]
*  But I'm saying- [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6328.219999999999s)]
*  A white flag with a green pine tree is Christian nationalism? [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6329.219999999999s)]
*  Wasn't it? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6332.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6333.16s)]
*  I don't know about this. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6334.16s)]
*  Do you know what I'm talking about? [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6335.16s)]
*  No. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6336.16s)]
*  What was this? [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6337.16s)]
*  Do you remember, Jimmy? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6338.16s)]
*  Samuel Alito, I think? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6339.16s)]
*  It was, I thought it was maybe Robert's, but his white, and then he's, and then, there [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6340.16s)]
*  it is. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6346.8s)]
*  An appeal to heaven. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6347.8s)]
*  So that flag was flying, and you can see there the Boston Globe, that's his New Jersey, the [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6348.8s)]
*  one right underneath that, Jamie. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6354.96s)]
*  That's his New Jersey house, beach house, and that got put up. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6356.48s)]
*  But this was all because neighbors started fighting about their signs. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6360.32s)]
*  What is that an appeal to heaven? [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6363.2s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6364.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6365.88s)]
*  What's that flag supposed to represent, Jamie? [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6367.4s)]
*  Huh. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6370.6s)]
*  But, interesting that our Supreme Court justice got involved in one of these sign fights. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6373.12s)]
*  And then they called him out on it, and he said, it's my wife. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6380.64s)]
*  It's just fucking hilarious, right? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6384.12s)]
*  It's my wife. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6386.64s)]
*  My wife did it. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6387.64s)]
*  My wife's a Christian nationalist. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6388.64s)]
*  Is that a Christian nationalist thing? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6389.64s)]
*  What? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6391.64s)]
*  A call to heaven? [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6392.64s)]
*  I don't know what that, I, we'll find out. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6393.64s)]
*  I've never even heard of it until just now. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6396.2s)]
*  Took it down from in front of San Francisco City Hall, probably part of the same issue. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6398.16s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6402.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, what does it mean? [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6403.5599999999995s)]
*  It has to do with the colonies, it said. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6404.5599999999995s)]
*  What? [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6405.5599999999995s)]
*  Revolutionary War. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6406.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6407.5599999999995s)]
*  The flag was originally used during the American Revolutionary War, flown by George Washington's [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6408.5599999999995s)]
*  cruisers and is associated with the early quest for American independence. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6412.88s)]
*  It's since been adopted by a different group, one that doesn't represent the city's values. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6417.12s)]
*  So we made the decision to swap it with an American flag. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6420.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, you probably should have the American flag there anyway. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6423.0s)]
*  You shouldn't have to swap it. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6426.36s)]
*  How about have the American flag everywhere, you motherfuckers? [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6428.719999999999s)]
*  America! [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6431.24s)]
*  But January 6, 2022, videos and photos show that some supporters of former President Donald [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6432.24s)]

*  Oh, they ruined it. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6439.96s)]
*  Just like the Nazis ruined the swastika. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6441.5599999999995s)]
*  Which was a Buddhist thing. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6444.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6445.5199999999995s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6446.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah, an appeal to heaven. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6447.5199999999995s)]
*  So what is it? [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6449.24s)]
*  So it's because it's Trump supporters now? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6450.24s)]
*  Is that why? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6452.0s)]
*  That's why? [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6453.92s)]
*  I don't know why Alito put it up, but I remember it being something to do with the homeowners' [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6455.6s)]
*  associations all were mad at each other and they put the flag up. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6460.96s)]
*  He threw his wife right under the bus. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6463.84s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6465.4800000000005s)]
*  My wife is fond of flying flags. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6466.4800000000005s)]
*  I am not. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6467.88s)]
*  My wife was solely responsible for having flagpoles put up at our residence and our [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6469.92s)]
*  vacation home and has flown a wide variety of flags over the years. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6473.92s)]
*  How many Palestine flags do you fly? [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6477.52s)]
*  Wide variety? [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6480.16s)]
*  Got a lot of Ukraine flags flying in the air house? [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6481.16s)]
*  What kind of flags you got? [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6483.16s)]
*  It just makes me laugh that look, this is the petty shit that normal Americans get in. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6484.4s)]
*  Supreme Court justice, just get out of it. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6491.24s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know about that flag. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6492.88s)]
*  This is the first time I've ever seen that. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6494.5599999999995s)]
*  But it's the thing that people do. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6496.48s)]
*  They want to let you know what they support and what they don't. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6498.5199999999995s)]
*  We love telling people what we believe. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6503.32s)]
*  And it's very important that we feel like we have beliefs and it's when we start sharing [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6506.28s)]
*  them that you find out other people might not agree with you. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6513.5599999999995s)]
*  This gets back to grit and toughness. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6519.04s)]
*  Well, this also gets back to the importance of your show, The Daily Show. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6521.48s)]
*  The Daily Show, especially under the tutelage of Jon Stewart when he's running the helm, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6525.88s)]
*  it's so balanced at pointing out ridiculous shit all over the place, which I think is [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6530.36s)]
*  so important. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6535.16s)]
*  That's the goal. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6536.16s)]
*  That's the aim. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6537.16s)]
*  So smart. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6538.16s)]
*  And when we do it right, I love it. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6539.639999999999s)]
*  And it is every day. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6541.84s)]
*  So sometimes you do it right and you're thankful, you pat yourself on the back, but guess what? [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6544.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a show tomorrow. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6549.12s)]
*  And I think we benefit men. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6550.76s)]
*  So many, I'll take, when I host so many questions, I'll take questions from the audience and [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6553.8s)]
*  so many people go like, Michael, how do you hold yourself to journalistic integrity? [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6558.5599999999995s)]
*  And I go, what? [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6564.28s)]
*  I'm a fucking comedian. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6565.28s)]
*  This is on Comedy Central. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6566.68s)]
*  I'm not a journalist. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6568.88s)]
*  The fact that you, just because you see us as informative, which I'm thankful for, and [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6570.12s)]
*  the fact that you come to us for information, which I'm thankful for, but I'm- [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6575.320000000001s)]
*  It's a little terrifying though, right? [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6578.52s)]
*  Don't ever forget, lady, I'm not a journalist. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6579.76s)]
*  I'm not in the war zone. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6582.8s)]
*  I'm a clown. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6584.96s)]
*  My job is to put all this shit into a comedy machine and crank out some type of sausage [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6586.4800000000005s)]
*  and feed it to you. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6590.92s)]
*  But it's nuts that- Comedy Central, Daily Show is considered [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6591.92s)]
*  journalism. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6597.360000000001s)]
*  And I'm sure people will stop me on the subway and go like, thank you for what you're doing. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6598.36s)]
*  And I'm going, I'm trying to just make you laugh. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6601.96s)]
*  Is that what you mean? [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6604.58s)]
*  It's not what they mean though. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6605.58s)]
*  They mean like- Fighting the good fight. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6606.599999999999s)]
*  Fighting the fight. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6608.32s)]
*  Decompressing the- Fascists. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6609.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6610.32s)]
*  And also, comedy, as we've talked about, is one of the only places that can challenge [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6611.32s)]
*  and speak to power truthfully. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6617.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6619.799999999999s)]
*  And comedy also can make you consider something. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6620.799999999999s)]
*  So like, if you have an opinion and you go out there and state your opinion eloquently, [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6623.96s)]
*  I could be there. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6628.16s)]
*  Well, I disagree. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6629.16s)]
*  I have a different opinion. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6630.16s)]
*  But if you go out there with that opinion, you make me laugh with something I don't even [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6631.16s)]
*  necessarily agree with. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6635.12s)]
*  Dude, that's the best. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6636.88s)]
*  And then you go, oh, he's got a fucking point. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6638.16s)]
*  He's got a fucking point. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6642.2s)]
*  I mean, that is the magic trick. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6643.2s)]
*  That's the magic trick of comedy. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6645.12s)]
*  And Daily Show does that great. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6646.8s)]
*  But I remember one time sitting with my wife at the comedy store. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6648.48s)]
*  Tiger Woods had just like, you know, all of that shit came out, the cheating, the voicemails. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6651.84s)]
*  I mean, he was like, you know, maybe arguably one of the more promiscuous husbands of all [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6656.24s)]
*  time. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6662.16s)]
*  And Burr goes up and he starts defending Tiger. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6663.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6666.599999999999s)]
*  And I'm watching, I'm feeling my wife's energy. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6667.599999999999s)]
*  Like, I'm like, Bill, don't do this, dude. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6670.08s)]
*  You're defending this guy who is in the heat of all the hatred. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6673.28s)]
*  And as I watch the joke, I feel her relax. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6679.12s)]
*  Now at the end, she's laughing. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6682.88s)]
*  And I'm like, you just did the fucking magic trick. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6685.12s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6687.5599999999995s)]
*  You did the trick. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6688.5599999999995s)]
*  He's one of the best at it. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6689.5599999999995s)]
*  You took the level of difficulty at its highest. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6690.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6692.64s)]
*  We were, all of us were against you. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6693.64s)]
*  You did it. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6695.16s)]
*  And that's, that's the shit. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6696.16s)]
*  That's as close to magic as there is now. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6697.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6699.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, it's a beautiful thing if you could turn a controversial subject into something [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6700.5199999999995s)]
*  hilarious. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6703.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6704.76s)]
*  That at least puts people's guard down for a second. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6705.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6708.08s)]
*  I think they'll see through it if they feel like it's just, you're truly trying to trick [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6709.08s)]
*  him into a message. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6711.64s)]
*  If your real goal is to entertain and laugh that, yeah, that's, you know, I, I heard, [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6712.88s)]
*  I was researching sauna stuff a lot because I was building this sauna last summer and [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6719.52s)]
*  I read that in Finnish culture, a lot of the politicians won't even start negotiating or [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6724.200000000001s)]
*  talking until they're like fucking scorched in the sauna. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6730.52s)]
*  And I thought that was really interesting because comedy, you know, I don't know how [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6735.04s)]
*  truthful it is, but I know there is a lot of pictures of, of, [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6737.96s)]
*  It's a good move. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6741.8s)]
*  I just, you all suffer together. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6743.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6744.88s)]
*  And it's like, comedy kind of does that too. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6745.88s)]
*  It's like, if we're all laughing, we at least have that in common. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6747.5599999999995s)]
*  If we're all sweating and having a hard time with this moment, we're human. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6751.0s)]
*  I love that. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6755.84s)]
*  I think that's pretty cool. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6756.84s)]
*  It's a human moment. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6757.84s)]
*  It's a human moment. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6758.84s)]
*  I mean, you're literally dying. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6759.84s)]
*  You're dying in there and [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6760.84s)]
*  You can't stay there forever. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6761.84s)]
*  You got about 20 minutes and then you got to get the fuck out and you're like, oh, yeah. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6762.84s)]
*  And now you can all be human together. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6766.92s)]
*  There's something really [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6768.639999999999s)]
*  That's a good move. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6769.639999999999s)]
*  It's really nuts to me about that, the dry heat of a sauna that I don't understand completely, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6771.04s)]
*  but it really fixes a lot of shit in me. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6776.280000000001s)]
*  You know another good thing about the, having the politicians go in the sauna? [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6778.4800000000005s)]
*  We can kill off a lot of the old ones. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6781.52s)]
*  Mitch McConnell ain't gonna make it. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6784.4800000000005s)]
*  There's no fucking way. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6785.64s)]
*  If you want, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6786.64s)]
*  There used to be a world sauna championships and then a guy died. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6787.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6791.04s)]
*  Well they kept pouring water on it. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6792.04s)]
*  If you can't, [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6794.320000000001s)]
*  On the rocks? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6795.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6796.320000000001s)]
*  Like they were pouring like a liter of water on every, I don't know what the time, but [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6797.320000000001s)]
*  I heard that. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6800.08s)]
*  I was like, oh my God. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6801.08s)]
*  And it was like 200 plus degrees and [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6802.08s)]
*  What's your, what's your sauna? [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6803.84s)]
*  How like, how would you advise me to get the most out of my sauna? [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6807.8s)]
*  20 minutes? [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6812.6s)]
*  Yeah, 20 minutes is good. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6813.6s)]
*  Cool off and come back in? [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6815.6s)]
*  You can if you like. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6816.92s)]
*  I don't necessarily do that all the time. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6817.92s)]
*  I'll do like one day a week. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6819.76s)]
*  I go cold plunge sauna, cold plunge sauna. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6821.16s)]
*  I go back and forth. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6823.44s)]
*  Usually I start with sauna. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6824.44s)]
*  I always end with cold plunge. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6826.0s)]
*  If I do three cycles, whatever it is, you end with cold plunge. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6827.32s)]
*  Because you want your body to fight to warm it back up. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6829.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6832.52s)]
*  So you just shock the shit out of your system. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6833.52s)]
*  But the finished studies that have showed the more people do it, the more effective [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6836.08s)]
*  it is in terms of what they studied was they found that when people over the course of [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6841.400000000001s)]
*  20 years use the sauna four times a week, they had a 40% decrease in all cause mortality. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6846.84s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6851.84s)]
*  Everything, strokes, cancer, heart attack, everything. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6852.84s)]
*  Because your body is becoming far more resilient and you're also developing all these heat [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6855.28s)]
*  shock proteins and eliminating inflammation, clearing out your system and then you're [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6859.52s)]
*  rehydrating afterwards. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6863.4800000000005s)]
*  Very very good for you. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6865.52s)]
*  You're also not on the phone. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6866.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6867.52s)]
*  You're also not on the phone. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6868.52s)]
*  Although I do have a Bluetooth speaker in there. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6869.52s)]
*  You can get some Bluetooth speakers. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6871.84s)]
*  I got one called Not A Brick. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6873.52s)]
*  It's a really good one. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6874.92s)]
*  You can take the heat of a sauna. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6875.92s)]
*  So I listen to like books on tape when I'm stretching, sweating my brains out. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6877.8s)]
*  I was in my sauna all by myself and it's very quiet. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6883.0s)]
*  I'm in the woods in Pennsylvania and this fucking buck just walks right in front. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6886.92s)]
*  It was just me and him. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6891.360000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you saw her or smelled or whatever but it was like crazy. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6894.12s)]
*  Oh that's cool. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6897.68s)]
*  Just to watch. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6898.68s)]
*  You know what? [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6899.68s)]
*  That's like, what's it called? [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6900.68s)]
*  I'm not a hunter. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6902.88s)]
*  What's it called when you just kind of go to watch and see where they're going to be? [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6903.88s)]
*  Is that called something? [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6907.32s)]
*  Yeah, observation. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6908.32s)]
*  Nature. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6909.32s)]
*  Nature watcher. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6910.32s)]
*  It was like just opening your eyes. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6911.32s)]
*  But that's, it was wild to see that. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6912.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's cool, isn't it? [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6914.12s)]
*  Very cool. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6915.12s)]
*  Wildlife is wild and especially if you don't expect it. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6916.2s)]
*  Like you're sitting in the sauna and there are deers right there. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6918.5599999999995s)]
*  What's going on here? [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6920.84s)]
*  I'm really grateful about the government doing it there. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6921.84s)]
*  They apparently drink alcohol in the sauna. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6923.36s)]
*  It's not a great idea but they get drunk before they go in. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6925.4s)]
*  I like that too. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6931.2s)]
*  I love them. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6932.2s)]
*  A long drink, iconic Finnish gin mixed drink that's basically a Tom Collins in a can but [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6933.2s)]
*  way better because it's being sipped in a sauna with new found sauna friends. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6938.599999999999s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6942.76s)]
*  That is cool. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6943.76s)]
*  That's a great move. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6944.76s)]
*  It's something that makes you more human. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6945.8s)]
*  You suffer together. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6946.8s)]
*  Yeah, you're also, you're focusing on a thing that isn't this result that we need or want. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6947.8s)]
*  Yeah, this should probably take all the congress people and make them run a tough mudder together. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6952.84s)]
*  Go through the mud, fucking climb ropes and shit, go over obstacle courses. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6957.92s)]
*  I've actually found, my wife and I, when we do a sauna, there's always stuff you've got [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6962.16s)]
*  to talk about with the family, logistics, there's always things to argue about but we'll [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6967.16s)]
*  go in there and we should both start sweating and then it's kind of just like eases the [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6970.52s)]
*  tone, eases the conversation, which is helpful. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6974.0s)]
*  Yeah, no one's real loud in the sauna. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6977.28s)]
*  Yeah, and you just chill. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6979.08s)]
*  We're both suffering together. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6981.08s)]
*  Yeah, just suffering. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6982.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6983.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think it should be a part of everybody's life and there's, by the way, if you can't [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6985.28s)]
*  afford it, they make a sauna blanket that is one of our sponsors, it's really good. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6989.56s)]
*  I've used that thing before, it's great. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6994.56s)]
*  You just climb inside this fucking blanket and you can bring it on the road with you. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=6996.56s)]
*  And you sweat it off. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7000.2s)]
*  Yeah, you can carry it that much, carry it and it'll heat you the fuck up and it'll give [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7001.4s)]
*  you the heat shock proteins. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7004.4s)]
*  I like a dry sauna better, I like being in a sauna, but if you want to travel or if you [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7006.04s)]
*  don't have the resources or a place for it, those things are great. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7011.639999999999s)]
*  Hot baths are great too. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7015.12s)]
*  Hot baths after a workout, supposed to increase muscle. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7017.12s)]
*  It's tough to find sauna though in a lot of American cities. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7020.16s)]
*  When I go on the road, I'm always trying to find, cold tubs are more frequent now. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7024.8s)]
*  They're more frequent now. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7030.92s)]
*  You know the way to do the cold plunge is you do it before you workout. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7032.4800000000005s)]
*  That's the real move. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7037.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh no shit. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7038.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that really increases testosterone too. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7039.4800000000005s)]
*  And also it increases your workout put because your muscles are like pre-chilled. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7040.72s)]
*  I would think it would be easy to get injured after. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7044.4800000000005s)]
*  No, you just warm up. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7047.88s)]
*  You just warm up. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7048.88s)]
*  You warm up. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7049.88s)]
*  So I go through a series of things that I do that are like pretty low intensity. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7050.88s)]
*  I do 20 kettlebell swings and then I do 20 push-ups and then I do 20 bodyweight squats [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7055.88s)]
*  and I do a cycle of five. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7061.320000000001s)]
*  So I do 100 swings, 100 push-ups, 100 bodyweight squats. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7062.72s)]
*  By the time of that, that's like probably 15 minutes. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7066.64s)]
*  By the time that's over, I'm sweaty, I'm ready to go. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7069.240000000001s)]
*  And then I go into everything else. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7072.400000000001s)]
*  Dude, I want to show you this picture. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7073.52s)]
*  I know that this lake house I have. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7074.96s)]
*  Nice. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7079.360000000001s)]
*  New Year's Eve. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7081.0s)]
*  I don't want to kill our time with this, but when do you get to show Joe Rogan this pic? [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7082.0s)]
*  So let me find it. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7087.48s)]
*  This is New Year's Eve, dude. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7091.2s)]
*  Cut a hole in the lake with an axe. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7092.719999999999s)]
*  And I'm just in the lake. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7095.799999999999s)]
*  Try to do three minutes. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7098.28s)]
*  There's a safety rope, which I don't know if that could even help me if I fucking pass [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7099.28s)]
*  out. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7102.92s)]
*  That's nice. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7103.92s)]
*  Doing a cold plunge in nature. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7106.32s)]
*  Not just the tub. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7108.96s)]
*  I love it. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7110.56s)]
*  I feel amazing after that. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7111.56s)]
*  Utah, they had a creek running through a glacier creek freezing cold. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7114.24s)]
*  I climbed in that bitch in my underwear and got up to my neck. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7120.4s)]
*  That's fun. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7123.68s)]
*  It's nice. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7124.68s)]
*  It's like something about doing it in nature, too. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7125.68s)]
*  It's like you're even more connected to everything. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7127.16s)]
*  Oh, totally. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7129.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7130.12s)]
*  Very cool. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7131.12s)]
*  Just getting that cold water and breathe. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7132.12s)]
*  I get like a weird high after for sure. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7133.12s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7136.96s)]
*  It lasts for hours. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7137.96s)]
*  It increases your dopamine by 200%. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7138.96s)]
*  It lasts for hours. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7141.84s)]
*  So why is it that healthier than doing a drug that increases your dopamine? [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7142.84s)]
*  Well, because it's natural. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7147.8s)]
*  Natural. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7148.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's natural. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7149.8s)]
*  Also, it gives you something in terms of mental resilience. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7150.8s)]
*  It gives you like an exercise. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7154.8s)]
*  That exercise is very difficult, especially for the first minute. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7156.6s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7160.88s)]
*  First minute, your body's like, let's get the fuck out of here. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7161.88s)]
*  It keeps talking to you and you're like, shut up, bitch. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7164.68s)]
*  Then after a minute, that calms down and you can breathe clean. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7167.04s)]
*  You start getting those rhythmic breaths in and out and just keep your shit together for [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7170.56s)]
*  three minutes. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7175.0s)]
*  Then when you get out, you're like, ah. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7176.0s)]
*  That's what you do typically three minutes? [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7178.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7179.96s)]
*  One, there's the feeling like I did it, which feels great. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7180.96s)]
*  I didn't bitch out. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7184.2s)]
*  I actually did it three minutes. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7185.2s)]
*  But then there's this euphoric feeling as your body just, your norepinephrine, your [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7186.64s)]
*  dopamine, everything elevates. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7191.2s)]
*  You just feel wonderful. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7192.68s)]
*  Patience, too. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7194.04s)]
*  I feel great. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7195.04s)]
*  I'm smiling more. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7196.08s)]
*  Kids, I'm smiling more. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7197.08s)]
*  Oh, that's fine. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7198.08s)]
*  You can draw on the wall. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7199.08s)]
*  Yeah, whatever. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7200.08s)]
*  It's like that part of your brain got exhausted. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7201.08s)]
*  The part of your brain that's dealing with real adversity. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7204.24s)]
*  So little kids' adversity is nothing. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7206.88s)]
*  It's not. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7208.6s)]
*  Yeah, freezing to death. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7209.6s)]
*  They're just like, that's my crayon. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7210.6s)]
*  Come on, guys. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7211.6s)]
*  Let's get along. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7212.6s)]
*  It's been a super benefit to me. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7215.6s)]
*  The problem living in New York is I don't get to cold plunge as much as I want to. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7217.84s)]
*  Well, they have stuff that you can do. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7222.48s)]
*  You could do it in your tub if you can get ice. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7224.72s)]
*  Ice, do the ice thing. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7226.64s)]
*  And they also have these coolers that you can plug in and you could do like, if you [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7227.64s)]
*  have one of those big yeti coolers, you can climb in that and you'll put a hose in there [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7233.04s)]
*  and a cooler and it'll bring that down to like 40 degrees. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7239.16s)]
*  And you can just get in like a yeti cooler. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7241.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7244.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I bet you could do it in a bathtub, too. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7245.360000000001s)]
*  I bet they figured out how to attach an engine to that. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7247.240000000001s)]
*  Do they have one? [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7250.16s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7251.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7252.16s)]
*  Jamie knows it. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7253.16s)]
*  I'll show you, but there's just like a little motor thing you attach to. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7254.599999999999s)]
*  So that's perfect. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7257.5599999999995s)]
*  Like if you just have a bathtub, you're golden. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7258.5599999999995s)]
*  You can actually do that. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7260.12s)]
*  You know, if you live in an apartment that has a tub, you have a cold plunge now. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7261.12s)]
*  Or if you don't have that, get yourself a yeti cooler. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7265.0s)]
*  Yeti makes some giant ass coolers, like from people hunt caribou and shit. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7267.639999999999s)]
*  I just typed in bathtub cold plunge. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7270.92s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7272.48s)]
*  So you just have this thing, it plugs in, it cools everything off and you climb it. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7274.44s)]
*  How cold does that motherfucker get? [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7279.8s)]
*  39 degrees. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7281.92s)]
*  Perfect. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7282.92s)]
*  Never buy ice again. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7284.68s)]
*  Two-year warranty. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7285.68s)]
*  We're such comfort zones as humans now that we have to pay $800 to cool our water to get [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7286.68s)]
*  into it. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7292.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's a bit of an issue. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7293.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7294.4s)]
*  Yeah, we're pussies. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7295.4s)]
*  We're pussies now. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7296.4s)]
*  We've made life very easy, which is wonderful. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7297.4s)]
*  It's better than being hard. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7298.68s)]
*  I don't want to live in the fucking cloud in the 80s. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7299.68s)]
*  That's right. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7301.68s)]
*  What the point was is to make it easy. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7302.68s)]
*  Yeah, make it so you don't have to... [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7303.68s)]
*  That food and sugar and fat readily available at all times. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7304.68s)]
*  You don't have to carry a sword with you everywhere. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7306.72s)]
*  Dude, I love going to the Natural History Museum in New York and going to the armor. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7309.36s)]
*  Jesus Christ, it's like what these motherfuckers had to wear and use and carry to defend themselves [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7315.84s)]
*  is nuts. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7323.24s)]
*  I think it's Waterloo. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7325.0s)]
*  One of the battles, one of the French soldiers got hit with a cannonball in the chest and [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7327.12s)]
*  They have the armor that has the hole in the chest, like in the cannonball out the back [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7334.5199999999995s)]
*  exploding outward. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7339.28s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7340.28s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7341.28s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7342.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's from the Battle of Waterloo. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7343.28s)]
*  That guy got hit with a cannonball in the chest. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7346.04s)]
*  And I bet you his armor salesman was like, I'm going to upsell this guy. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7348.5199999999995s)]
*  And he's like, no, I don't want the upsell. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7352.08s)]
*  Then he should have. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7353.44s)]
*  Monsieur, I'm telling you, this armor, no cannonball. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7354.799999999999s)]
*  That is a great reminder of what society and life used to be. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7358.88s)]
*  Goddamn, man. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7365.28s)]
*  Look at that one on the other one, Jamie. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7366.28s)]
*  No, but the one to the left where you see the exit, right to the left of that. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7368.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right there. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7372.48s)]
*  You see the exit hole. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7373.599999999999s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7374.599999999999s)]
*  Boom. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7375.599999999999s)]
*  Blew right through this guy's body, his armor, his chest, out the back. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7376.599999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7381.28s)]
*  The size of a fucking softball. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7382.28s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7384.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty fucked up. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7386.08s)]
*  That's super fucked up. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7388.719999999999s)]
*  That was life back then. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7389.719999999999s)]
*  It's better. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7390.719999999999s)]
*  And that's a guy that could have had armor. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7391.719999999999s)]
*  That's probably a high, high ranking person. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7393.12s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7395.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7396.400000000001s)]
*  He got, he got hit. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7397.400000000001s)]
*  That's a wrap, son. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7398.400000000001s)]
*  But you got to think that those people would have much rather live today with all this [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7399.400000000001s)]
*  comfort. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7405.320000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7406.320000000001s)]
*  The problem is you just can't rely on it too much. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7407.320000000001s)]
*  You can't live for comfort. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7409.0s)]
*  That's stupid. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7410.68s)]
*  You got to have voluntary discomfort. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7411.88s)]
*  That'll help you get through this life. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7415.64s)]
*  That's a good way to put it that those people would pick today for sure. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7418.2s)]
*  Fuck, yeah. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7422.84s)]
*  I went, I remember like I went to the Museum of Medical Oddities in Philadelphia and they [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7423.84s)]
*  were doing a whole thing on dysentery. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7432.32s)]
*  And it was like, oh, most people in the Civil War died of that. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7435.759999999999s)]
*  They didn't die of like wounds. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7440.48s)]
*  And it was like wild that, of course, if you were a soldier today, you don't die of dysentery. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7442.48s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7449.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7450.04s)]
*  There was a place near the toilet and it was like, [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7451.08s)]
*  And what kind of water are you drinking? [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7453.04s)]
*  Water and all that shit. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7456.48s)]
*  There's no iodine tablets back then. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7457.92s)]
*  No Steri pens to clean your water. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7460.24s)]
*  What's the one I used? [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7462.96s)]
*  I did the Appalachian Trail last year. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7464.48s)]
*  Not all of it. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7466.4s)]
*  Just a few days. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7467.4s)]
*  And I forget the thing I would filter the water with. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7468.88s)]
*  It was great. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7471.24s)]
*  Man, there's such cool stuff like that. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7472.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, there's great stuff. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7473.48s)]
*  Millions of those things. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7474.48s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that will filter water and make it drinkable. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7475.48s)]
*  And there's all these cool Appalachian Trail communities that leave stuff for people along [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7479.04s)]
*  the trail. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7485.36s)]
*  So I remember I was just like dying. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7486.36s)]
*  I'm like no more snacks. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7487.84s)]
*  Blood sugar's dropping. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7490.32s)]
*  I have water, but I'm in it. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7491.32s)]
*  I'm doing the difficult thing. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7493.12s)]
*  And then you get to this cooler and it's like from this Appalachian Trail club and it's [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7494.24s)]
*  just like gummy bears in there. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7497.28s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7498.84s)]
*  Nice. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7499.84s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7502.36s)]
*  That's cool that they have that set up. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7503.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7504.36s)]
*  That's the only thing to choose to do. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7505.36s)]
*  To go for a long walk. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7506.36s)]
*  That doesn't feel like a trail filled with serial killers. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7507.36s)]
*  There are some famous murders that have happened on the Appalachian Trail, but I felt very [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7512.0s)]
*  safe. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7517.32s)]
*  Did you? [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7518.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7519.32s)]
*  I mean I loved the idea. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7520.32s)]
*  I was alone. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7521.32s)]
*  I loved the idea of finding a place to sleep that's in the middle of nowhere. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7522.32s)]
*  I love that shit. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7524.639999999999s)]
*  Dude, I'd be super nervous. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7525.639999999999s)]
*  Something about the woods. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7528.44s)]
*  Really? [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7529.44s)]
*  The woods are dangerous at night. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7530.44s)]
*  Here's what's crazy about the Appalachian Trail, at least where I was in Jersey. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7531.44s)]
*  Most of the time I had cell service. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7535.16s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7536.16s)]
*  So I'm like in my tent. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7537.16s)]
*  On Instagram. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7538.16s)]
*  That is kind of crazy. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7539.16s)]
*  You know what started that for me was during COVID, my wife got me this week with Jordan [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7544.16s)]
*  Jonas in the survival. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7553.4800000000005s)]
*  Jordan Jonas won alone. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7556.12s)]
*  He's been on the podcast. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7557.12s)]
*  Yeah, I've been on the podcast. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7558.12s)]
*  He's been on the podcast before. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7559.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7560.12s)]
*  One lost. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7561.12s)]
*  Shot a moose with a bow and arrow. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7562.12s)]
*  He killed a wolverine with a hatchet. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7563.48s)]
*  Stealing his meat. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7566.48s)]
*  So my wife bought me a week with the survival camp with him and a bunch of other people. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7567.48s)]
*  And it was just like one of the things, one of the conclusions I and we came to while [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7572.24s)]
*  we were up in the Bitterroot Mountains of Idaho was at least once a year, we all need [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7576.86s)]
*  to be doing something where we are embedded with nature. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7583.34s)]
*  And this might sound silly to somebody who goes hunting or somebody who's already doing [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7586.4s)]
*  this. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7589.28s)]
*  But it's not really life. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7590.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7591.44s)]
*  Going to the park is not really experiencing nature. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7592.44s)]
*  Well, it is a little. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7595.48s)]
*  It's a tiny bit. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7596.48s)]
*  It's nature. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7597.92s)]
*  I mean, it's contained nature, but it's real nature. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7598.92s)]
*  You see squirrels and birds. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7600.92s)]
*  It's good for you. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7602.24s)]
*  It's good for you to sit under a tree. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7603.24s)]
*  There's ticks. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7604.24s)]
*  There are ticks. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7605.24s)]
*  There are ticks, man. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7606.24s)]
*  Ticks are wild. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7607.24s)]
*  Your dog's going to get fleas. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7608.24s)]
*  Yeah, ticks are a bitch, especially on the East Coast because of Lyme disease, which [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7609.24s)]
*  turns out was manmade. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7615.44s)]
*  Turns out there's a lot of real evidence that Lyme disease was weaponized and that it leaked [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7618.16s)]
*  out of a lab and that came out of a lab called Plum Island, which was close to Lyme, Connecticut. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7625.320000000001s)]
*  And RFK Jr. firmly believes that this was a weapons program. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7632.16s)]
*  And what they were going to do is develop these fleas and ticks with a disease that [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7635.88s)]
*  spreads rapidly, wipes out the medical system of a community so you could dump them from [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7641.68s)]
*  a plane. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7647.08s)]
*  Everybody gets infected, overwhelms their medical system, and then they're more vulnerable [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7648.48s)]
*  if you want to attack them. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7653.32s)]
*  That just doesn't seem very thought through, though. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7655.04s)]
*  Well, there's some less thought through ones. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7657.48s)]
*  There's one that they were developing at one point in time. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7660.12s)]
*  I don't know where they got with it, but there was talk of them developing a bomb that they [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7661.92s)]
*  would detonate over cities that would blind everybody. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7665.72s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7668.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7670.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7671.5199999999995s)]
*  Imagine that. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7672.5199999999995s)]
*  You detonate that, and then you have 300,000 blind people. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7673.68s)]
*  Isn't it amazing what we can do in a positive light and also what we can do in a negative [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7678.280000000001s)]
*  light? [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7683.080000000001s)]
*  Oh, we're scary. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7684.080000000001s)]
*  And we're scary in our ability to justify these things. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7685.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7687.72s)]
*  You know, that's what's really crazy. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7688.72s)]
*  We're scary in our ability to decide that these people are the other, so we should bomb [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7690.52s)]
*  them into oblivion. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7696.120000000001s)]
*  And like, yeah, we're winning. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7697.120000000001s)]
*  Like, oh my God. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7698.88s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7699.88s)]
*  You don't even know those people. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7700.88s)]
*  The other is an effective strategy. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7702.2s)]
*  Well, it's built into our tribal mindset. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7706.5599999999995s)]
*  Our tribal brains. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7709.4s)]
*  Is that right? [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7710.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7711.4s)]
*  We had Darrell Cooper on the podcast yesterday who runs a podcast called Martyr Made. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7712.4s)]
*  And one of the things he talked about was oxytocin. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7717.599999999999s)]
*  And he was like, it's really interesting because oxytocin makes you really deeply love your [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7719.36s)]
*  family and your community. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7725.36s)]
*  And this is what women get when they have children and men get and when you're in love [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7727.3s)]
*  and this. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7730.72s)]
*  It also makes you very hostile to outsiders. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7731.8s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7735.16s)]
*  It's like it protects the people that you love and that are vulnerable, but it makes [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7736.16s)]
*  you very protective of the outside. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7741.68s)]
*  So like you are less likely to trust strangers, less likely to trust other people. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7744.900000000001s)]
*  And it probably served an enormous benefit. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7750.4400000000005s)]
*  It's probably very beneficial. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7754.4400000000005s)]
*  In the caveman days, you had to have it. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7755.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7757.76s)]
*  You had to have it. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7758.76s)]
*  I mean, there were so many people coming over with spears. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7759.8s)]
*  They found you and you had women and food. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7762.24s)]
*  Like you're fucked. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7765.24s)]
*  And that was most of our evolutionary existence. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7766.8s)]
*  Most of the time from leaving the savannas and experimenting with different foods and [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7770.12s)]
*  becoming human beings, we were fighting. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7775.52s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7786.68s)]
*  Well, slowly but surely. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7787.68s)]
*  If we just give in to our God AI, we will be fine. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7788.8s)]

*  Right. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7813.280000000001s)]

*  I have two phones. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7823.32s)]
*  I have an iPhone and I have a Galaxy phone. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7824.32s)]

*  websites and it gives me a summary. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7830.5599999999995s)]
*  So instead of reading this long winded blah blah blah, tell me what you figured out. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7833.04s)]
*  And then I can get a summary and then I can, oh, they realized that Earth is actually blah [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7838.5199999999995s)]

*  It transcribes things. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7848.24s)]
*  It translates things in other languages. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7849.76s)]
*  Translates it directly into your ear if you have the Galaxy earbuds. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7852.48s)]
*  Pretty fucking crazy. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7854.76s)]

*  And this is just the beginning of this stuff. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7859.32s)]
*  Essentially, when you have chat GBT or grok on your phone, you have access to the most [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7861.0s)]
*  insane amount of answering power that a human being's ever experienced. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7868.0s)]

*  Right. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7888.72s)]

*  That's crazy. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7910.92s)]
*  Nazis look like German men. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7911.92s)]

*  it's Google Gemini. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7929.4s)]

*  It makes perfect sense. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7967.24s)]
*  It fits with the ideology or the idea that, you know. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7968.4s)]
*  And somebody wrote an article once that I was Greek. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=7972.92s)]

*  Holy shit, man. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8004.76s)]
*  So much of what social media is is bots. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8005.76s)]
*  And I don't think people even really truly understand it. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8006.76s)]
*  But it's a lot of people who are like, oh, I'm a Greek. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8007.76s)]

*  We've covered it many times before. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8021.0s)]
*  But there was an FBI, former FBI agent who examined Twitter interactions. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8022.6s)]
*  He estimated as much as 80% of it is bots. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8028.08s)]
*  Fake bullshit. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8031.08s)]

*  Because there's no way it's 5%. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8035.24s)]
*  Because if you're an out-of-state actor, if you're a state actor from another country, [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8037.4s)]

*  Who knows? [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8051.32s)]
*  You're going to carpet bomb any sort of controversial subject with all sorts of propaganda. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8052.32s)]
*  Of course they're going to do that. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8056.72s)]
*  Of course. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8058.72s)]
*  And right now, that's totally doable until you all submit to AI. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8059.72s)]
*  Once you put the chip in your brain, then deception will be impossible. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8063.6s)]
*  We will eliminate one of the biggest problems in society. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8068.0s)]

*  AI is going to tell you that we can solve all the world's problems if we just eliminate [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8236.960000000001s)]

*  Yeah, I'm fearful that I don't even know the language to help my kids figure this shit [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8249.12s)]
*  out. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8257.480000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8258.480000000001s)]

*  It's not even spoken. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8260.480000000001s)]
*  I mean, I love to advocate for media literacy, push for that, teaching all of us what a more [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8261.480000000001s)]
*  reputable website is or a news source. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8271.16s)]
*  But that just feels cute compared to what's coming. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8273.4s)]
*  What the language of an AI president who offers all solutions. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8277.4s)]
*  I don't know how to combat that. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8282.72s)]
*  Not just that, but an AI that's attached to quantum computing. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8283.939999999999s)]
*  So once they figure out a way to actually program quantum computing to run AI, you're [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8287.74s)]
*  going to have a god. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8293.279999999999s)]
*  You are. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8297.56s)]
*  You're going to have a god. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8298.56s)]
*  And Mark Andreessen, and I've said this before, I apologize, but Mark Andreessen had a quote [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8300.32s)]
*  about an equation that quantum computing was able to solve that if you took the entire [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8305.76s)]
*  universe, every molecule, every atom in the universe, and you converted that into a supercomputer, [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8313.32s)]
*  the entire universe would die of heat death before it could solve this problem. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8319.72s)]
*  And quantum computing solved it in minutes. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8325.6s)]
*  The only thing that makes sense to them is that quantum computing is somehow or another [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8328.88s)]
*  tapping into the multiverse and it's solving this equation using multiple universes and [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8333.48s)]
*  the information available in multiple universes simultaneously. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8341.439999999999s)]
*  What? [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8345.72s)]
*  I know. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8346.72s)]
*  It's hard to even like track. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8347.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8349.92s)]
*  And this is just the version of it that we have in 2025. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8350.92s)]
*  That we have right now. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8352.8s)]
*  And so this is an actual thing that's happened. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8353.8s)]
*  And so most people aren't even aware of what quantum computing means. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8357.800000000001s)]
*  So once this becomes not just one of these, but hundreds of these, and then they're scalable [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8362.0s)]
*  and they're attached to nuclear reactors, which is what they're proposing, they're going [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8368.12s)]
*  to have their own nuclear reactors, multiple nuclear reactors as power sources because [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8372.04s)]
*  these things require insane amounts of power to run. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8377.44s)]
*  Then the quantum computing, once it becomes sentient, is going to develop a much better [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8380.68s)]
*  version of itself. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8384.48s)]
*  Of course. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8385.48s)]

*  And then he takes me to the back to this enormous dumpster and it's just filled with these little [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8539.119999999999s)]

*  I don't know why they would do that, but maybe because we subsidize soybean farmers? [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8551.96s)]
*  Probably. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8557.52s)]
*  How weird. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8558.52s)]
*  That the rats know that it's food. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8559.6s)]
*  Or that they figured it out that it's food. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8561.44s)]
*  Or it isn't really food, but it smells like food and they bite into it and they realize [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8563.84s)]

*  They can eat everything though. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8569.560000000001s)]
*  They eat each other. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8570.560000000001s)]
*  I had a rat problem in my house once when I lived in Encino. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8571.560000000001s)]
*  And I set a rat trap in my garage and I killed this big fat rat and I was tired. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8575.640000000001s)]

*  And I heard the snap and I went out there. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8585.08s)]
*  He's a big fucker. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8586.880000000001s)]
*  The rat traps are no joke. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8588.24s)]
*  So I got up in the morning and went out to clean the rat trap and he was gone. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8590.439999999999s)]
*  The only thing that was left was his tail. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8594.96s)]

*  It was like some skin and hair, but his entire body the rats consumed. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8597.96s)]

*  And it made me realize like, oh God, this is the reality of what this is. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8608.72s)]
*  These aren't just rodents. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8612.679999999998s)]
*  These are fucking cannibals. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8614.48s)]

*  Yeah, like eight per person or some shit. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8649.68s)]
*  Something crazy like that. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8651.8s)]
*  Like the biomass is similar. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8652.8s)]
*  Like the humans and rats, like the amount of humans there are. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8654.76s)]
*  The weight of the humans is very similar to them, roughly. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8657.08s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8659.56s)]

*  I mean, I remember before COVID, I would stand on the subway platform at my train stop and [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8668.32s)]
*  I would watch the rats on the tracks and then the train would come and they would scurry [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8673.92s)]
*  because they'd feel the train coming. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8679.16s)]
*  Now, they just step off like an inch and the train goes right past them, but they're close. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8680.76s)]

*  I don't know what, I don't know what went on, but it's, yeah, they're eating your car. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8696.72s)]

*  Just jumping all over the outside of my car. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8718.2s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck? [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8719.88s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8722.24s)]
*  And that's the 90s. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8723.24s)]
*  That's the 90s. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8724.24s)]
*  It's like, wait, how many, how many did they have then? [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8725.24s)]
*  And they've probably exponentially expanded. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8728.04s)]
*  Are they just so good at reproducing? [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8730.88s)]
*  They're just that good at it, huh? [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8732.96s)]
*  Well, they're really clever too. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8734.6s)]
*  One of the things they show in this documentary is when they put poison in these areas where [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8735.6s)]
*  these rats are, they send some young, stupid rat to go test it. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8739.96s)]
*  And they sit back and watch. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8743.8s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8744.96s)]
*  And this young, stupid rat eats it and you watch. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8745.96s)]
*  And I go, yeah, all right. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8747.96s)]
*  Then they go eat that rat that died. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8750.119999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8752.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8753.64s)]
*  They're clever little fuckers. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8754.64s)]
*  I remember, I thought that's how coyotes hunted. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8755.64s)]
*  I used to golf in Griffith Park in LA and you would see one coyote and I learned like [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8758.76s)]
*  the pack would send out one. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8763.6s)]
*  Go look. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8765.6s)]
*  Check it out. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8766.6s)]
*  They do it to get dogs. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8767.6s)]
*  That's how they get dogs. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8768.6s)]
*  And the dog will run and then a bunch of other ones will pile onto them. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8769.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8773.44s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8774.44s)]
*  Is this a horror movie? [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8775.44s)]
*  Sorry, I actually put it on screen on accident before. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8776.44s)]
*  Rats Night of Terror 1984. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8779.08s)]
*  That's so fucking good. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8780.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, it was a goofy ass shit. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8781.08s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8783.08s)]
*  It's a claw out of her mouth. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8784.08s)]
*  Oh, it's clawing out of her mouth. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8785.08s)]
*  It is a good one. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8786.08s)]

*  He he he he he. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8789.08s)]
*  Rats Night of Terror. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8791.08s)]
*  Yeah they've always been a fucking terrifying animal, man. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8793.08s)]
*  They've always been terrifying. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8795.88s)]
*  Actually roaches freak me out more, but rats I at least can sympathize with and understand [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8796.88s)]
*  that they're like living beings with families and shit. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8802.76s)]
*  But roaches though, I don't know, man. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8806.48s)]
*  That's just the way they fucking are so quiet. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8809.36s)]
*  You don't even know they're there. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8812.2s)]
*  Well, that's the thing about cities. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8813.56s)]
*  They're just infested by all these parasites that live off of the city. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8815.4s)]
*  You know, and essentially rats, you know, if the city didn't exist, there was no way [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8819.8s)]
*  there would be that many rats in an area. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8824.699999999999s)]
*  They only exist in a place that doesn't have anything that eats them. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8827.16s)]
*  They don't, you know, they've tunneled under so they protect themselves from raptors. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8830.24s)]
*  So there's no birds that fly down and snatch them up. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8833.76s)]
*  There are coyotes in New York City, but there's not nearly enough to deal with the amount [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8837.119999999999s)]
*  of fucking rats that are there. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8840.039999999999s)]
*  It's gross. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8843.16s)]
*  There's a movie, Dark Days, about the people that lived in the subway tunnels. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8844.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8847.36s)]
*  That's a fucking wild movie. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8848.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's like Vegas, right? [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8849.36s)]
*  It was in New York, I believe. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8850.68s)]
*  Oh right, right, right. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8852.16s)]
*  But some of these motherfuckers were like running an extension cord like 500 feet. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8853.16s)]
*  Yeah, they had like opened wires up and spliced into things. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8858.16s)]
*  And it's like, you know. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8862.8s)]
*  Yeah, they have generators down there. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8863.8s)]
*  Watching TV and shit. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8865.64s)]
*  Bizarre, man. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8866.64s)]
*  I mean, what a fuck, what keeps you going? [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8867.64s)]
*  You know, there's like wealthy people that are committing suicide. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8870.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8872.64s)]
*  These motherfuckers are like grinding. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8873.68s)]
*  I mean, this is like... [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8875.039999999999s)]
*  In the tunnels, man. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8876.039999999999s)]
*  This is deep in the tunnels. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8877.039999999999s)]
*  And you know, anyone who's lived in New York City, you look down those tunnels and you [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8878.84s)]
*  go, what's down there, man? [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8883.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8884.76s)]
*  And every now and then kids go, let's go look. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8885.76s)]
*  Oh, that's the only part of the trailer they show. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8887.24s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8889.84s)]
*  There's good monster movies that take place in tunnels too. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8890.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8893.279999999999s)]
*  Because that's always like, you wonder what's down there. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8894.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's be a good... [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8895.76s)]
*  Wasn't that like the strain? [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8897.279999999999s)]
*  Wasn't that part of the vampire lore that they lived in the tunnels? [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8898.279999999999s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8901.279999999999s)]
*  But tunnels are creepy, man. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8902.279999999999s)]
*  When you cross into complete darkness. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8903.92s)]
*  Cities are creepy. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8906.12s)]
*  You stack all those people on top of each other like that and everybody's just walking [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8907.12s)]
*  down the street together and going down alleyways. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8910.640000000001s)]
*  And then the cities today are so much safer than they ever were in the past. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8914.12s)]
*  Who the fuck wanted to live in the cities in like 1700s? [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8919.560000000001s)]
*  Dude, and like there was just like a trough for sewage and then people would die of the [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8922.28s)]
*  plague and they would just throw them in the street. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8926.92s)]
*  I know. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8928.640000000001s)]

*  I live in Brooklyn now, yeah. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8933.96s)]
*  So it's kind of like city... [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8935.68s)]
*  Well, no, it is the city, but it's not like Manhattan on top of each other. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8937.08s)]
*  Do you live in hipster Brooklyn? [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8940.16s)]
*  I live... [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8941.359999999999s)]
*  Is hipster Brooklyn existing anymore? [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8942.359999999999s)]
*  I live in Bed-Stuy Brooklyn, which is becoming hipster. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8943.359999999999s)]
*  Bed-Stuy do or die. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8945.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's becoming hipster Brooklyn. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8946.08s)]
*  That was when Mike Tyson grew up. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8947.08s)]
*  That's right. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8948.359999999999s)]

*  It's on its way and it's not full hipster. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8952.68s)]
*  Are there hipsters anymore? [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8957.519999999999s)]
*  I was just reading something like that about the people that dress. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8961.039999999999s)]
*  They were like a postal employee from the 1700s. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8965.119999999999s)]
*  My definition of a hipster was always like, dad's money dressed like they don't have money. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8971.56s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8977.199999999999s)]
*  But what's a hipster? [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8978.199999999999s)]
*  But there's also the hipsters that would dress with curly mustaches and bow ties. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8979.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, those guys. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8984.0s)]
*  Yeah, so that's not Bed-Stuy yet. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8985.0s)]
*  That's Williamsburg. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8987.359999999999s)]
*  That's kind of died off though. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8988.359999999999s)]
*  Hasn't that look kind of died off? [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8989.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=8991.2s)]

*  That's a big Brooklyn move. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9003.12s)]
*  But yeah, it's a great. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9006.6s)]
*  I mean, it's great for comedy. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9010.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9011.480000000001s)]
*  Walking around Brooklyn, the shit you see. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9012.480000000001s)]
*  January, our front door was broken. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9015.6s)]
*  Didn't lock all the way. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9019.16s)]
*  It was broken for 18 hours. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9020.92s)]
*  No one knows it's broken. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9024.720000000001s)]
*  Just our building. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9026.44s)]
*  It's only three apartments. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9027.44s)]
*  Somebody checks the door. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9029.800000000001s)]
*  It's not locked. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9032.52s)]
*  They go up to our hallway. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9033.52s)]
*  They steal all my family's winter coats, including mine. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9034.52s)]
*  This is the heart of January. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9037.320000000002s)]
*  So we were as a family, we wake up, let's go to the park, let's do whatever. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9039.560000000001s)]
*  We open the door where we kept our coats in the hallway. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9042.28s)]
*  Everything's gone. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9045.32s)]
*  So it's like, holy shit, it's the middle of January. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9047.16s)]
*  All our shit's gone. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9048.92s)]
*  I call the detective, the cops come, whatever. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9049.92s)]
*  He's like, these motherfuckers walk up and down the street every night checking for every [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9051.92s)]
*  door just to see if something is broken. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9055.64s)]
*  Year and a half later, I've been looking for this one coat that I love, the Scotch and [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9059.44s)]
*  Soda multi-color pattern coat. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9062.44s)]
*  I love it. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9067.08s)]
*  I just look it online for my coat, right? [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9068.36s)]
*  Someone's got to sell my coat. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9070.28s)]
*  So I find it on Poshmark. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9071.64s)]
*  The coat. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9074.24s)]
*  I don't know if it's my coat, but it's the exact same coat, which you can't find at [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9075.24s)]
*  the Scotch and Soda anymore. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9078.0s)]
*  I buy it. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9079.359999999999s)]
*  It comes from my neighborhood, from a woman. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9081.48s)]
*  She sends it to me. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9084.0s)]
*  I put it on. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9085.0s)]
*  My wife is like, that is your coat. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9086.0s)]
*  100% that's your coat. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9087.0s)]
*  So I fucking bought my coat back from the person that stole it, most likely. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9088.76s)]
*  Do you know who the lady is? [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9092.84s)]
*  I don't. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9093.84s)]
*  I did a Google search and nothing really came up. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9094.84s)]
*  I was just like, how hard do I want to fight this? [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9096.64s)]
*  At least you got your coat back. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9098.64s)]
*  I got my coat back. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9099.64s)]
*  That's just the price you pay for living in Brooklyn. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9100.64s)]
*  It's winter and I feel part of me is like, holy shit, someone had to steal our coats? [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9103.8s)]
*  That sucks. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9110.08s)]
*  I've never even thought about not having a coat. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9111.08s)]
*  I have a coat. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9116.279999999999s)]
*  I have multiple coats. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9117.279999999999s)]
*  So there's a part of me that was just like, come ask, I'll give you a fucking coat. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9119.0s)]
*  And the part of you was like, oh, they're selling them online. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9123.64s)]
*  Fuck you, that's my coat. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9126.0s)]
*  They're making a profit. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9127.359999999999s)]
*  That's the difference between the heartfelt, compassionate view, like, oh, these poor people, [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9129.2s)]
*  they have to steal coats. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9135.12s)]
*  Then you're like, oh, actually they're selling it, so they're fucking heroin money. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9136.12s)]
*  Well, if that's the case, that sucks. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9139.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it does suck. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9142.36s)]
*  Yeah, it does suck. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9143.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's a weird thing about living in large communities of people like that. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9144.36s)]
*  There's just too many variables. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9148.16s)]
*  A lot of variables that are not good. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9149.800000000001s)]
*  And one person affects so many. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9152.720000000001s)]
*  The one guy on my street that doesn't do a good job with the trash, it gets knocked [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9156.44s)]
*  over, the wind blows it, the rest of the street picks it up. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9161.52s)]
*  That's the shit that as you get older, the city starts to fuck you up. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9164.92s)]
*  I don't want to pick his trash up anymore. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9169.12s)]
*  My time is all I have. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9172.04s)]

*  That's the weirdest thing. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9202.68s)]
*  Somehow that got through the litter loophole. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9203.68s)]
*  Right. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9206.320000000002s)]

*  How long does it take for a cigarette filter to biodegrade? [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9225.0s)]
*  Let's take a guess. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9228.2s)]
*  I was thinking not the best reason for it, but if you just throw it in the trash, you [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9229.92s)]
*  could start a fire if you didn't put it out right. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9233.4s)]
*  So that could be. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9234.88s)]
*  No, you step on it, man. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9235.88s)]
*  And then you throw it in the trash. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9236.88s)]
*  People don't step on it right all the time. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9237.88s)]
*  I'm just telling you. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9238.88s)]
*  If you just, people are dumb. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9239.88s)]
*  So this is a dumb thing we're talking about. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9241.2s)]
*  Nah. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9242.84s)]
*  They're doing it where there's no trash anywhere near them. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9243.84s)]
*  They're throwing it down alleyways. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9245.48s)]
*  They used to do it in a lot of the comic stores all the time. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9246.48s)]
*  Comics would do it. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9249.039999999999s)]
*  I'm like, come on, man. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9250.039999999999s)]
*  Don't do that. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9251.039999999999s)]
*  I bet you it's 200 years for a filter to biodegrade. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9252.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I would say at least. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9257.84s)]
*  If it's like Styrofoam or some shit, it's like a thousand. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9258.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's like some fucking fiberglass or some shit. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9260.84s)]
*  By the way, is that even better for you? [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9263.28s)]
*  18 months to 10 years. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9264.56s)]
*  18 months to 10 years. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9266.32s)]
*  That's pretty vague. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9267.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9268.84s)]
*  Depends which one they're using. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9269.84s)]
*  That's AI. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9270.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9271.84s)]
*  Oh, it depends on which one. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9272.84s)]
*  I'm sure they don't all use the same one. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9273.84s)]
*  I'm sure it's probably hemp or something like that. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9275.44s)]
*  Yeah, those fucking. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9276.44s)]
*  Yeah, hippie smokes. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9277.44s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9278.44s)]
*  Now, cellulose. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9279.44s)]
*  Huh. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9280.44s)]
*  Wait, what? [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9281.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9282.44s)]
*  This is where we're getting to this weird spot of AI. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9283.44s)]
*  I was going to bring that up. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9287.44s)]
*  Google AI stuff fucks up all the time. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9288.8s)]
*  Look on the screen. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9290.84s)]
*  It says 18 months to 10 years here. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9291.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9293.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9294.52s)]
*  I go right here. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9295.52s)]
*  Are cigarettes biodegradable? [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9296.52s)]
*  No, they're not biodegradable. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9297.52s)]
*  They're made of plastic called cellulose acetate, which can take up to 10 years to break down, [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9298.72s)]
*  and it can also leach toxic chemicals into the environment. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9302.8s)]
*  But it does break down. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9304.8s)]
*  It's not biodegradable. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9305.8s)]
*  So it breaks down. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9306.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9307.8s)]
*  Or I don't. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9308.8s)]
*  It's poison. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9309.8s)]
*  It just breaks into smaller toxic pieces. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9310.8s)]
*  Yeah, it breaks into poison. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9313.8s)]
*  Also, if you're smoking a filter and the filter's got toxic chemicals. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9314.8s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9318.8s)]
*  And you're heating it up. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9319.8s)]
*  Photodegradable. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9320.8s)]
*  That seems like a nice, fun term they found. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9321.8s)]
*  Photodegradable. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9323.8s)]
*  But not biodegradable. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9324.8s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9325.8s)]
*  Trap residues from smoking, including arsenic, cadmium, and toluene. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9326.8s)]
*  Toleune? [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9330.8s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9331.88s)]
*  Toluene? [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9332.88s)]
*  Toluene? [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9333.88s)]
*  This is the issue with AI. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9334.88s)]
*  I try not to even, but it's contradicting itself. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9335.88s)]
*  I was reading a thing where a professor was talking about the issues that he's having, [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9338.88s)]
*  grading papers and accusing people of using AI. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9342.88s)]
*  And then it's like, it's just opened up this whole door that they don't know exactly how [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9345.88s)]
*  to deal with. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9350.88s)]
*  Because you could get AI and write something, and then you could write something similar. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9351.88s)]
*  You just kind of like twist it around a little bit like a joke thief would do. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9355.88s)]
*  And then you're basically using AI to write your papers. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9358.96s)]
*  But I think AI will sell that professor AI detection software. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9361.96s)]
*  Yeah, but if you do a good job of spinning the words around a little bit, especially if [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9365.96s)]
*  you're dealing with historical facts or something that's true, AI is going to lay it out for [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9370.96s)]
*  you. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9375.96s)]
*  You have to do zero research. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9376.96s)]
*  And if it's like, you just print it in that order slightly differently. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9377.96s)]
*  I guess the bigger question is, does writing the term paper serve a value at this point [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9383.039999999999s)]
*  if AI can just do it? [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9389.039999999999s)]
*  I spent a lot of time learning cursive. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9391.039999999999s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9394.039999999999s)]
*  It's useless. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9395.039999999999s)]
*  It's like, if you're a student though, if you're really trying to get the most out of [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9398.039999999999s)]
*  your education, it's like, what are you trying to do? [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9402.039999999999s)]
*  Are you trying to get good grades? [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9403.039999999999s)]
*  Are you really trying to get educated? [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9404.039999999999s)]
*  If you're trying to get educated, don't cheat. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9406.039999999999s)]
*  Just actually figure it out. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9408.039999999999s)]
*  You have to actually absorb the information and learn. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9410.12s)]
*  But if you're not really into that subject and that's not really your thing, and you [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9413.12s)]
*  really want to get a degree in this, but you have to take a course in that, like, ehhhh. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9417.12s)]
*  And you could spend an hour working on something instead of 16 hours. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9422.12s)]
*  Yeah, or if you want to be a skateboarder and you've got a half pipe outside, have AI [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9426.12s)]
*  do the term paper and go fucking go crazy. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9430.12s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have to read that fucking giant 1,400 page book. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9432.12s)]
*  This is also a bigger question about our education and public schools and like... [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9436.2s)]
*  Dude, you're going to be in the matrix. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9442.2s)]
*  You don't need education. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9443.2s)]
*  They're going to plaque it in, press a button, you're going to be like, me, oh. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9444.2s)]
*  Joe is fully... [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9447.2s)]
*  I know Kung Fu. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9448.2s)]
*  That's what it's going to be. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9449.2s)]
*  Yeah, I really firmly believe that. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9451.2s)]
*  I also believe it's going to be genetic engineering, so people are going to be unrecognizable. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9454.2s)]
*  I think whatever we have coming over the next hundred years is going to make the last hundred [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9458.2s)]
*  years look like a joke. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9462.2s)]
*  The change of 1925 to 2025 is pretty extraordinary. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9464.28s)]
*  It's going to be nothing compared to the change that we experienced by 2125. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9469.28s)]
*  Do you think humans will always elevate themselves and speak to a crowd for laughs? [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9474.28s)]
*  That might be the only thing we have left. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9482.28s)]
*  Because they've always said it's prostitution and comedy where the court jester and the [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9484.28s)]
*  prostitute, I'm curious if we think in the future that will remain as well. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9491.36s)]
*  I hope so. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9495.36s)]
*  I hope so. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9496.36s)]
*  Yeah, it would suck. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9497.36s)]
*  Well, definitely memes. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9498.36s)]
*  Memes will probably get better. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9499.36s)]
*  That's a good form of comedy. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9500.36s)]
*  That's true. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9501.36s)]
*  There will be some kind of comedy. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9502.36s)]
*  There's always going to be human folly as long as there's humans. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9503.36s)]
*  I don't know how long that's going to last. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9506.36s)]
*  That's the real concern. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9508.36s)]
*  We might be obsolete. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9509.36s)]
*  We might be giving birth to this obsolete thing willingly, signing up for AI. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9512.36s)]
*  So if we become obsolete, then that means the machines will have to also figure out [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9517.44s)]
*  how to provide energy to itself. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9523.44s)]
*  That'll be easy. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9525.44s)]
*  But that'll be easy. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9526.44s)]
*  They'll learn. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9527.44s)]
*  They'll just plug this into this. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9528.44s)]
*  They'll do it way better than us. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9529.44s)]
*  Just mine the thing and then burn the thing. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9530.44s)]
*  Yeah, they'll probably harness some shit we didn't even think about. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9532.44s)]
*  It'll be far more efficient. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9535.44s)]
*  No carbon footprint. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9537.44s)]
*  No need to worry about things breaking down anymore. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9538.44s)]
*  And then we'll just slowly die off or whatever. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9540.44s)]
*  Then they'll put up a shield system to protect us from asteroids. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9542.44s)]
*  They'll figure that out. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9545.44s)]
*  Right. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9546.52s)]
*  What's that movie where Sylvester Stallone lives in the basement of the earth or whatever? [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9547.52s)]
*  Judge Dredd? [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9554.52s)]
*  Yeah, maybe it's Judge Dredd. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9555.52s)]
*  I am the Lord. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9556.52s)]
*  But I feel like it's all these people who refuse the advancement of technology. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9558.52s)]
*  There's going to be some of that. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9561.52s)]
*  Yeah, there'll be a lot of people living in the Amazon still eating monkeys. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9563.52s)]
*  The rest of the electrified world is going to be very strange. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9567.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9572.52s)]
*  But hopefully we'll still crack jokes. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9573.6s)]
*  Michael? [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9576.6s)]
*  That would be great. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9577.6s)]
*  Hopefully. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9578.6s)]
*  All right, should we wrap this up? [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9580.6s)]
*  Your book. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9581.6s)]
*  Tell everybody. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9582.6s)]
*  My book is called? [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9583.6s)]

*  The publisher's going to kill me. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9588.6s)]
*  I said I was going to present it to you on the show. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9589.6s)]
*  Whoopsies. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9590.6s)]
*  We got a photo of it. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9591.6s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9592.6s)]
*  Adventures in Tennis and Comedy. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9593.6s)]
*  Lucky Loser. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9594.6s)]
*  Get me a copy and I'll put it out there on the bookshelf. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9595.6s)]
*  We've got a lot of books out there. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9597.6s)]
*  We should have sent you one. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9598.6s)]
*  If you don't, I'll get you one. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9599.6s)]
*  Yeah, so the book starts when my brother gave me a tennis racket for Christmas when I was [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9602.68s)]
*  four. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9607.48s)]
*  Nice. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9608.48s)]
*  And my dream was to be a professional tennis player. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9609.48s)]
*  And we did it, but only to 864 in the world. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9612.12s)]
*  That's my highest world ranking. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9615.76s)]
*  It should have turned into a check. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9616.76s)]
*  It could have dominated. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9617.76s)]
*  That's the point of the book. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9618.76s)]
*  But the story is how I went from pro tennis to comedy and it's fascinating and silly and [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9623.04s)]
*  a lot of failure. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9630.32s)]
*  We're talking a lot about the struggles of being alone in both of those professions. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9631.32s)]
*  Tennis, you're alone, problem solving. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9636.88s)]
*  And comedy, you're alone and problem solving. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9639.119999999999s)]
*  Well, you're a great comic. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9641.16s)]
*  You're a very funny guy and you've always been very cool to hang out with. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9643.0s)]
*  And I'm really excited that you're at the club this weekend. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9646.36s)]
*  Are there any tickets available? [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9648.24s)]
*  I got an email yesterday from my management that all shows are sold out. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9650.16s)]
*  So if anybody wants to go, the best case thing is you go and wait at the front and sometimes [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9653.8s)]
*  people don't show up, which does happen, especially the South by Southwest. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9659.68s)]
*  It's crazy parking. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9662.720000000001s)]
*  But I'm psyched. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9665.24s)]
*  I'm psyched to see you at the club. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9666.6s)]
*  I'm coming this weekend. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9668.2s)]
*  I'll come hang out. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9669.2s)]
*  Dude, thank you. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9670.2s)]

*  And thanks for having me and congrats on the club and all that's happened. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9673.2s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9676.2s)]

*  All right. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9681.2s)]
*  Bye, everybody. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8&t=9682.2s)]
