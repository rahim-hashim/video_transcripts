# JRE MMA Show #86 with Josh Thomson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkXLwBnORg)
*  T... 2... 1... Joshua! What's happening my man? What's going on man?
*  So, I looked at your Instagram yesterday and you had that video of Stephen A Smith and immediately I was like, oh my goodness this explains so much.
*  Play this. Play this Jamie. Watch this. Watch this.
*  First of all, someone needs to explain to me what's happening here.
*  It looks like a dick punched to the left. I don't even think it's a dick. Unless that guy's got a two foot dick. Look how low he's punching.
*  No idea man. This guy should not be allowed to talk about fighting.
*  Yeah look, I'm going to cut him a little bit of slack. Only, I'm serious, we had this, here's the thing with Strikeforce, we had kind of a similar situation, not like this though by the way, with Gus Johnson.
*  I remember.
*  With Gus, was trying to talk him and I love Gus when he's talking basketball. I think he's got the energy and the voice that makes people like, oh wow, they're gripped to the TV.
*  This I can understand with Stephen A but this is not what you want to release after you just called someone who's a pioneer in the sport. You basically called him a quitter.
*  You called a guy a quitter. First of all, he had a broken orbital bone. Okay? You're saying he was a quitter? He got his face smashed.
*  He got cracked by one of the biggest punchers in the sport. He has the most wins in the sport. He has the most wins by finish. He has the most bonuses. I mean, come on. He has the most fights. Come on.
*  You're calling that guy a quitter? He got cracked. That's what happens. Look, fighting is the only sport that you could end it early. Right? You can't end a football game in 40 seconds.
*  Imagine if your front line was so strong, your quarterback was so badass, you could storm a football game in 40 seconds. It'd be a different sport.
*  My concern with him though was that he's fine. He just did the video. I get it. It's good that you're trying to learn the sport. But I got to tell you, DC sent me this video and he basically commented on it.
*  And I said, I said, D is trying to protect the DC is trying to protect him. I said, you cannot protect this guy. Not from this. You can't call someone like Cowboys, Serrani or any other, I'm sorry, any other top guy in any organization.
*  I don't care if it's UFC, Bellator, one, any of them, all the, all these organizations. You cannot do that to these guys. These guys lay it on the line every time. We're not slapping a puck or hitting a baseball. Okay?
*  We're really out there getting hurt. And when someone calls you a quitter like that, you better be, I'm not saying he should be careful, like watch his back, but don't expect these fighters to be very courteous to you next time you walk in the hall.
*  And that's the issue that I think we come across here with top fighters are very offensive when they get offended when things like this.
*  Rightly so. Yeah, it's a different thing. There's the, the emotional cost of losing a fight is so much different than losing a game. It's not the same. And there's a culture in sports broadcasting, whether it's radio or television, this just diminishing of people.
*  There's this shit talking that goes with sports, you know, he always falls apart. That guy, that motherfucker needs to give his money back. He sucks. He this and that. And the other guy's like, Oh, I can't believe you're saying that.
*  You could do that in sports radio and people love it. Because if you're on the job site and you're listening to the radio and you're fucking hammering nails, you're like, you're right. He does suck.
*  There's a mentality that goes along with that kind of sports radio sports guy talk. I hate that shit. I've resisted that from the beginning and I've shit on those guys from the beginning because it's not the same thing. You're not talking about the same thing. You're talking about fighting.
*  You're talking about unbelievable physical consequences, including knock on wood in our sports. Very rare, but death.
*  Yeah, no, it's true. But the other thing though, too, is that you're criticizing someone for being a quitter and someone who's been been there on every level of the game. Every level. But not only that, but then you look like you've never played basketball or baseball or any other sport in your life. Either hits like that. I'm sorry.
*  You cannot criticize people and to be on the talk show like you're saying those talk show radios. That's the energy you need to bring when you're going to get someone like Max Kellerman or any of the other or skip Bayless and those guys go ahead and have that conversation with them.
*  But you cannot can't look like that. I'm sorry, man. That culture, the culture of the sport. Max Kellerman is a different animal. Max Kellerman is incredibly knowledgeable when it comes to sports and really so when it comes to boxing. He's not a shit talk. He's just more honest about it. Yeah, that's true.
*  But there's a lot of currency in being a Stephen A Smith. You know, he's really entertaining. But that shit talking that he does. He's a he's you know, he's he's a guy that's fun to watch. He talks a lot of shit. He gets real loud and everybody disagrees with him. And look, it's made him a fantastic career. That's why and he carries that over to MMA. I think it's a bad idea.
*  Is it a stick though? That's my thought my process like you know how Chael has his stick like he did and I get the camera turns off Colby has his stick and when the camera turns off, they're not that person. Right? Is he that person in real life? I think it blends in, you know, is it he just now inherited that person. So that's who he is now in real life.
*  And you're clay and your ice clay. His real name is Andrew Silverstein and the dice man was a character that he used to do in his act. Dice clay is like one of the best impressionists ever. Yeah, he does like he does. John Travolta and all these different people. And it's amazing. And in his act, he would do all these impressions and he would do this guy, the dice man. And he would do these fucking rhymes and he put this jacket on and everybody loved that so much. He just became the dice man. And then after a few years, he was a dice man 24 seven.
*  He's wearing his leather jackets everywhere. Everywhere he goes got weightlifting gloves on every time you meet him. He's got weightlifting gloves. He became this guy. Right. And it's a thing that happens to people sometimes where people love one thing. You lean into your fans. And I think Stephen A. Smith, I don't know him as a human being. I've only met him a couple times. He's a nice guy. Nice guy to me. We had a nice conversation on air. We had a little weirdness because he was just saying we didn't learn anything about Connor. I'm like the fuck you didn't. Yeah, he just destroyed cowboy in 40 seconds. Like you look at him.
*  You learn something. You learn he can perform under the bright lights in a giant pay per view after more than a year and a half out of the game. Yeah, you learn something. You just don't know what you saw. Yeah, I agree with you 100 percent that he did learn something. I learned something from him like somebody who'd taken that amount of time off. And I'm going to say this to be frank. Obviously, I work for Bellator and I do a lot of work for them. But the thing is you can't have to give credit where credit is due. I give credit to all the fighters. It doesn't matter if you're in one. Look, Eddie to me is one of the best 55 pounders to ever walk the face of that.
*  The great Conor McGregor to me. I thought he did things in that fight against Khabib that no other guy has been able to do. First off, he won a round. Yeah, that's something no one's ever. People say, oh, well, could be took the round off. Yeah, because he's maybe he tried to finish him at the end of the second. But the bottom line is he still won the round. Yeah, okay. And there's not only that, but there was a lot of times and opportunities where could be had a hard time getting the takedown. We didn't see that against guys with wrestling backgrounds like Abel Trujillo and those other guys where he was flinging around winning records basically for the most takedowns of one fight. Yes.
*  There's tons of things that Connor does that people overlook and underestimate because he's such a knockout artist and he's so good and his stance and his style and things that he brought this to the next level. And you cannot discredit what he's done in the sport. What I learned from that is that from somebody who can take 15 months off and come back and perform the way that he did against someone like Donald Cerrone is absolutely amazing. That's why you need guys like you doing post fight commentary and discussing these things.
*  It's amazing not people who don't understand the sport and practice dick punches. Well, I want to ask you this though, because it was funny because I could see your face in the middle of it all. How awkward is that for you to stand between the two of them and go? What are you guys fucking talking about? Yeah, I mean, I would have preferred to talk to DC or Felder or you or anybody who understands the sport. I don't think it's the right way to do it. The one gentleman to my right, Michael.
*  Jamie, what is his last name? He was great. And Stephen Smith was very nice to me too. And he said he's going to get into podcasts. I have no problem with him as a human being. I just think, look, I don't know jack shit about baseball. I don't know jack shit about basketball. I literally don't even know the rules. I don't know what when people foul people. I'm not sure why. I don't know what's happening. I know MMA. I understand it. So if you want to talk about MMA, I'd like to talk to MMA about someone else who knows MMA. Like you were saying, though, I was watching the
*  one of your podcast the other day with Mike Baker. Okay. And he said, like, look, I don't agree with Bernie Sanders policies. Okay. But Bernie Sanders probably is a really nice guy. Yeah. It doesn't mean that I have to like what he does in front of the camera. Okay. For for him to call him. I don't have to like that. I can still like him as a person. Yeah, that's where we need to make sure that we differentiate between the two things. Like, look, he probably is a really good guy. And I actually have met him. I met him at the Floyd Mayweather and Connor fight and said, Hi, said, Hey, how's it going? Like, hey, what do you think? And that was the conversation was real quick, real brief, maybe two minutes. But he seemed like a nice person
*  at that time. But when when I was listening to him talk and calling ceremony, basically a quitter, to me, I just lost I lost respect in the avenue that you're not supposed to be working in our sport. Yes. Okay. And you need to make some sort of adjustment, whether it's dick punching or something else. You need to figure it out. You need to like I understand I get that it's a good idea for all people that have never covered the sport to try to get into it. Okay. Maybe hold off on the videos like that for a while. Before you post them. Yeah. But I like that he's trying
*  to be a good person. And I'm going to give him credit for that. And I think like with Gus, there was a lot of rumblings about Gus Johnson, the very beginning, but we gave him a run for a while. And I really like Gus. He's a great person. Always been great. Every time I've talked to him and met with him and worked with him side by side as well calling fights it was strike force. Great person. But his forte is basketball. And for him, whatever his forte is, Stephen A. Smith. Yeah, he's got I think he may have to stick with that. And I think I agree, they have to bring DC back in to work with you alongside. Yes. Well, he is phenomenal. Yeah, DC is phenomenal. And
*  DC and me having that conversation would have been a completely different conversation. And it would have been it would have been better for the sport. Because look, there's no there's no positive in downplaying the career of Donald Cironi or what he can do as a fighter. What that showed to me was how phenomenal Connor performed. That's what it showed me. And if if either you or I was talking about cricket, we're on TV doing commentary on cricket, we would look at a place we'd look for it would be fucked up and real cricket fans would
*  be upset at us. Right. Now that's nothing. That's just a sport. Right. Yeah, this is you are naked in the most literal sense of the word. You're you're naked physically, you're naked emotionally. When fighters lose, it's it's fucking devastating for Connor to smash cowboy like that in front of his wife, his kid, his grandma, and then the whole world. Like that is that's you got to have some respect for that man, you know, and this sport demands a different perspective. It's it's not the same thing as a
*  ball going into hoop. It's not the same thing as crossing the line with a football. It's different. It's very intense and very personal. And it's also very fucking dangerous. And to play it off like it's just a game. I just I don't agree with it. And I just think that we have plenty of fucking people out there that understand the sport. There's plenty of them. Yeah, there's but the thing about him is he's really popular. And Jamie, when you saying he just got a giant deal or something like that. Big top paid. I had his contract up. He's got like an extended
*  contract. He's got like a million a year now or something like that. Yeah. And that's because he's so his personality is so fun. It's he's a fun guy to watch. And people love shit talking. They love two people arguing about shit. One person's better at arguing. And Stephen A. Smith is really good at that stuff. But it's not the place for MMA. It's just not the place. It's not the same thing. It's not because because the guys themselves can fight. You know, when you see what happened last night at what Kansas and Kansas State or whatever, they started throwing
*  punches and it was like it looked like a bunch of girls throwing windmills. You know what I mean? Like that's really the reality of it's like, you know, if he wants to go out there and talk about it, go ahead and talk about it. He can say all the things he wants because these are college kids that can't fight. Obviously, we just saw. Right. You know, but we're talking about professional athletes. Their life has been around this craft. Yeah. And now you're going to say things like that. It's very disrespectful. It's just so common with sports to talk about a guy who can't show up on game day. Talk about a guy who keeps dropping the ball. Talk about a guy. And you shit on those guys. But
*  it's just a different thing with fighting. And it's also with fighting. You have to know it or no one's going to respect you if you don't know what you're talking about. And you're talking about in front of millions of people. Like, man, that's a bad look for everybody. It's a bad look for ESPN. It's a bad look for him. It's a bad look for the sport. It's like there's other people that can do this. Yeah, we got a lot of flack for Gus for a while. The strike force did like and then I think it trickled on up to CBS and that whole deal.
*  Mayhem brawl. Yes. These things happen in MMA. Yeah. That's definitely not the words you want to use in that situation. You know what I mean? But it does honestly, like you just said, it does reflect badly, not just on ESPN itself, but the UFC as well, because they're in business together. And it kind of looks bad for both. Like, hey, you guys, we need to monitor who's behind that microphone because we're representing our talent and our talent is what makes us the money. But what's funny is with Stephen A. Smith, he's his personality and his brand is based on his talent.
*  And he's not on that kind of shit talking. So this is all good for him. This is all good for him. Like the more people talk shit about him, the better it is for him. And then he just ramps it up even more and more people are paying attention. The ratings go up until he sees cowboy in an elevator. Go ride a fucking head, buddy. Who's quitting now, bitch? Yeah, you know, those are the things I got to tell you. You just don't know. Think about this. If he said something like that about a nader Nick Diaz and they saw him in a fucking elevator, they would fuck him up. They would fuck him up. Legitimately.
*  You got to be like those are scenarios where you just got to be careful. Cowboys never going to do that. Hey, man, kind of just watch what you say. Come on, man. I know my family's there. My grandmother's there. You know, my kids there. Right. You know, let's let's dial it back a little bit. That's cowboys a fucking he's just an amazing person. You know, overall. Yeah. So we're talking. Yeah. When you're talking about athletes and fighter like Nate Diaz, though, he is saying shit to you. He's just going to sock you. Look, everybody knows what happened. What happened is Connor had a spectacular performance. Cowboy got
*  caught off guard and he got finished quick. That's what happened. All the other stuff is unnecessary. The emotional devastation of a 42nd KO like that is we have as a respectful human being. You got to leave all that other stuff alone. All that shit talking. If you want to say it in the gym to one of your homies and you're just hanging out and maybe one of them doesn't like cowboy and you know, and someone talks trash and that's private and no one hears it. That's fine and good. But when you want to do that publicly, you want
*  to broadcast that and then also do it on ESPN. I think it's just it's just short sighted and I think it's foolish. Yeah. I'm going to go a little bit more hard on the paint on guys like DC who are on my post right there. The one that is defending him right now. That's defending. Well, hey, man, he's trying to learn the sport. I said, Dej, quit trying to tow the company line, son. That's what you're doing right now. And then I got Kendall Grove that goes on there to say, oh, you know what? I can respect the fact that he's trying to learn it. Look at this. I think it's fine. He's trying to better understand our sport.
*  It means he's a massive star who could talk from his perch and no one can touch him. Yet he chooses to try and learn the game. So there's some weight to his opinion. You're a little off base champ.
*  DC is a wonderful person. He's just I said, I told him, I said, look, just because Stephen A Smith might be good for business and the ESPN business for you later on. I said, that doesn't mean you got to tow that line, buddy. Yeah. I'd like to give him a hard time. But DC is one of my best friends, man. And he's absolutely hilarious and just fun.
*  He likes to do this to stir the pot because like you were just saying with Stephen A, he likes to do this type of stuff. So people keep talking. DC likes to try and make it like this. So we're here right now talking about DC in this whole situation. That's exactly what DC does. He's brilliant when it comes to this type of stuff.
*  Yeah. And I'm sure he really does love Stephen A as a person. Stephen A is a, he's a nice guy. Like I said, I've met him a couple of times. He's a nice guy. But just to like, there's a, there's a style of broadcasting that sports radio and sports broadcasting that they do this kind of stuff. But when it leaks over into fighting, fighting is just not a sport. You can call it a sport. It's kind of a sport, but it's, it's sport in its highest sense of expression where it's, you're literally using the word sport in its highest sense of expression.
*  And it's like, you're using your body to try to stop another man's body. And it is intense as it gets. And I think it deserves more respect. That's just my opinion. That's how I've always treated it. That's how I've, when I, when I talk about fighters or my, my concentration has always been to elevate. My concentration has never been to demean someone unless there's something that they did that's illegal. If there's some sort of, sort of blatant foul that should be stopped or something that's really dangerous that they're doing that should be chastised.
*  It's, it's, it's a higher level of consequence and risk and it needs to be respected that way.
*  Yeah, I feel, so I got, I listened to your show quite a bit and I like a lot of what you had talked about before when you first got into the comedy about talking about how some of the other comics was like kind of shit on other young comics, kind of up and coming.
*  And when you came in, it was like a different, you try to just ingrain in people like, Hey, I want to build you all, all of you guys up that are with me on the same set. If we're doing the show and we're all on the same night, let's all just fucking make each other look good. I feel like especially in fighting, whether it's boxing, MMA, anything along those lines, we got to be elevating each other to make each other better.
*  Like, Hey, this guy is good. This guy is good without talking shit. Cause we like yourself specifically, as well as like even myself and other guys that have shows and podcasts and start talking.
*  We're on a plot on a different level of platform that can really kind of either make or break some people's careers.
*  Yeah. It also with also the sport is confidence. Okay. MMA is a, a confident level. Anytime you do wrestling, it's a one-on-one combative sport. It's a wrestling MMA. Confidence is key. If my confidence is low, then that means that I'm not probably not going to perform my best.
*  And when you take a loss, it goes lower and lower. When you got to hear it from fucking people that don't know the business like this right here, it's just another thing added on.
*  And for other MMA guys to shit on other MMA guys, all that does is tear them down even more. And you could potentially, I'm not saying ruin their career, but you're, you're not helping them get to their goals and their levels.
*  It's better if everyone shines and we all handle ourselves with class and respect. And I feel like we just in general need to hold ourselves to a higher standard. If we're talking MMA and making sure that we showcase this guy is really good.
*  Like here, I'll give you an example. All I do when I talk about Frank Yeager is talk about how such an amazing person, even when he has a bad performance, he's still one of the best to ever do the game and all the things that he's done from the before in the past.
*  I say the same thing about BJ Penn, somebody who look, he exploded on the scene. I was training with him when he had that, that first run through Din Thomas, Uno, all those guys. He was training in AKA.
*  All the things that happen now to me, those are just bumps in the row as fighters get older, you know, and they just don't know how to react. Like this is it. I don't know what's going on.
*  They need somebody to step in, not shit on them. They need someone to step in and talk to him. I text and talk to him all the time. It's like, hey man, it might be time to move on. It might be not. Whatever the deal is, but they're good people at heart.
*  I know them personally and we should just be talking in general about lifting these guys up to the next level. And that's the way I think every sports should handle it.
*  The argument against that would be the massive success that Connors had shitting on people in press conferences and shitting on people and leading up to a fight. And the fact that that's built up so much animosity, but also so much attention.
*  Like the Aldo fight, he made that fight by talking so much shit. It's a big part of why that fight was so successful. And it was also like some serious psychological warfare.
*  When Aldo went into that cage with Connors, you could see the weight of all that shit talking was weighing heavy on him. You could see it. It was like he probably hadn't slept. He's probably really fucked up like that emotionally.
*  Because Aldo was super respected. He was the fucking king. He was the guy that had torn through the featherweight division for years and he had beaten everybody. Beaten the best of the best and widely regarded as the greatest featherweight of all time.
*  And then all of a sudden Connors is shitting on him and shitting on him and shitting on him and tearing his picture apart and stealing his belt at press conferences and all that craziness.
*  It made the fight way bigger, but it also fucked with Jose physically and emotionally. So when they actually fought, he had a diminished performance. He was too emotional. He lost his composure. He rushed forward.
*  He tried to hit him before everything was set up and he got cracked for it.
*  Yeah, I understand what you're saying in those terms. But when you're promoting a fight, promoting a fight to me is a separate thing.
*  Though I think Conor overstepped the boundary when he talked about Khabib and all the other family stuff, especially when he posted the picture with his wife.
*  That to me is, you're over the, like I understand, like Chael's done it a couple times when he talked about Jenna Jameson and Tito and that whole situation.
*  Like there's moments, I think the word guys have stepped over the line. But if I'm talking shit to you, taking your belt and doing those things, look, I'm marketing the fight. That's a separate issue than doing what some guys do.
*  And if you get a percentage of the pay-per-view, it actually benefits you and that guy shits on you, which is even more disturbing.
*  But the other thing is, well, look, always whether win or lose, Conor's never shown a disrespect after. I haven't seen that.
*  I haven't seen that afterwards as far as like in the cage when they see him, hey, great fight. Even when he lost to Nate the first time, he was very respectful.
*  Yes. Very respectful. And I think, look, there's a difference between marketing the fight and then you realize when the fight's done, shaking hands, be like, okay, look, let's do it again.
*  And that to me is that's a fighter's mentality. I want another crack at you, whether I won or I lost. I want another crack at you.
*  It's okay to market the fight, but once the fight is done, shake your hand. That's what this sport is about. That's what fighting is about.
*  That's what it's always been about. You know, from back in the days when guys would just put up their dukes. I mean, that was we would fight each other, okay, help you up off the ground, shake your hand and move on.
*  Well, people like that about it. It's one of the things you remember when Ronda Rousey beat Misha Tate and she wouldn't shake her hand after the fight and the fucking booze were so crazy.
*  I was interviewing her after the fight. You could barely hear her talk. It was just boo. People didn't like it. They didn't like it at all.
*  Yeah, no, that's that's you're going to always get that. I think when there's disres blatant disregard or disrespect for somebody, especially of that caliber, like Misha Tate.
*  And after the fights over. Yeah, like what people want to see is that it's resolved. They don't see these crazy endless wars where you're never happy. You just arm party fucked her arm up. Yeah, you're still upset.
*  Yeah, we got plenty of endless wars everywhere else. Exactly. Exactly. Man, when you see Connor at 170, you know, obviously he beat Donald really handily. But do you think he's a legit 170?
*  No, I don't think so. Because, um, we saw with Khabib, Khabib could potentially be a legit 170, but even him, he'll be a little bit too small for guys like Usman. Yeah, guys like Usman. Now, I think he could I think he could out wrestle Usman. He can out wrestle Colby.
*  I think, you know, I think so. 100%. I've seen him wrestle with DC. I've seen him wrestle with Olympic caliber wrestlers in our in our in our room. I'm telling you right now. Yes.
*  Did you train with Jordan Burrows at your place? I didn't see him train with Jordan, but I heard Jordan was come had came through. Yeah, I wasn't sure if they I wasn't there during that time. I would like to be a fly on the wall to watch those two guys go at it. But I can tell you this he trained with Ed Ruth. Yeah, how was that? And it was what it was what? Yeah.
*  Like, yeah, I mean, you don't want to say anything, but no, but there was moments that were, you know, Ed was able to get some stuff on him, but he was able to get some stuff on Ed as well. And Ed was able to get the tape or Khabib was able to get the takedowns as well on a three time and C2A national champ.
*  Wow. And you could tell look, Khabib's had more experience in terms of MMA, you know, like Samba was basically just MMA with a key top on and you know, occasionally were shingars with Ed, Ed was relatively new into the sport when they first started training and it was able to do a lot of good things to him.
*  And Khabib was able to do a lot of good things to him without saying too much. Both of them definitely benefit from their training together. And that's what's great about our gym is that there's no it's not a pissing match in our gym like sure guys want to one up each other when it comes to sparring. But I would say that Ed, he got the better of learning the most from that situation. Whereas Khabib realized that his stuff works on the top caliber guys in the world.
*  Well, you guys have it, aka you guys have one of the most top like wrestling heavy in terms of a high level wrestling like you have one of the most concentrated camps.
*  Yeah, what people need to remember is that that camp was ran by crazy Bob Cook and Javier first Javier crazy Bob Cook. But then also when they linked up with when Bob Cook linked up with Zincon Entertainment and Zincon and the Zincon family is very into wrestling.
*  All three brothers were all Americans at Fresno State, wrestled with Lorenzo Neal who is a professional football player in the NFL but also wrestled at Fresno State also an all American. Those guys all linked up and they're big big into wrestling.
*  So what they've done like literally could tell you this is he would the three brothers would if I brought up to a wrestler right now that I never heard of you probably never heard of. They could tell you all their stats. They could tell you what they did in high school.
*  They could tell you what they did in college. I could tell you how far they potentially will go in the Olympics. You know what I mean? Like that's how much ingrained that they are into this. So a lot of the reasons why we get we've gotten guys like Ed Ruth Aaron Pico was signed with them when he first started his career.
*  DC you know at Doron win all these guys that have come they've all they've all come through because of Dwayne Zincon. Aaron Pico is a crazy case right? It's he's such a talented guy and he's still very young. Yes. But there was so much hype on that kid right out of the gate and they put him in against real tough competition right out of the gate. Yeah look he had to fight he had to fight tough competition around the gate. There's a couple things what people need to understand is this is if I'm going to pay you to do this. I'm going to pay you to do this. I'm going to pay you to do this. I'm going to pay you to do this. I'm going to pay you to do this. I'm going to pay you to do this. I'm going to pay you to do this. I'm going to pay you to do this. I'm going to pay you to do this. I'm going to pay you to do this. I'm going to pay you
*  this amount of money because there's so much hype around you then you're going to have to fight this level of guy right. Okay. Now the problem with what happened with him he's not a 55 pounder he's tiny so he could potentially make 35. Really. Yeah he's not a big guy. So that's what people keep forgetting. So when they when he wanted to stay at 55 we said okay we'll give it a go let him get one or two fights you know in that position but no one wanted to fight him. No one. We were calling some of the best guys in Bellatoria you know at the time they're like
*  no let's we want to see a couple of fights is first before we go you know throwing our names out there to fight this guy. We'll see how he is. You know what I mean. And so when that happened and I'm not knocking them and that's smart on their part I mean every top guy's like yeah let's see what he is first and then we'll figure it out. But then as soon as he lost his Zach Freeman who was tall long lengthy you know good decent submissions not not a world be not a world beater but he was good. Aaron got exposed in the first fight got clipped and jumped in on a double leg got guillotine was out. Okay. Then he decided to make the loop down to one
*  forty five had a couple good performance. He's got big dogs. He's got big dogs in his hands. He's got heavy hands but he's a boxing base with wrestling background which works if you've already been around guys that have been done plenty of kickboxing if you're just a boxing base kicks come from angles you're not used to like different from punches. And so he just needed to get to a camp and stay focused on one area with one or two coaches that would groom him into that. Now is it Jackson Wink. I think it's perfect for him because
*  he's there with good really really good grapplers and really really good good guys. And so with with Jackson they're grooming him and telling him how the game Jackson's one of the best at game plan. I mean you can't deny that. And the fact is is that he just needed someone to get in there. Now I do know like he had a couple little issues like obviously he didn't he really didn't go to high school. I mean like as far as he was just traveling around and trying to become the best wrestler in the world. I mean at a young age he's you know he's he's winning everything and that's it's hard when you take
*  someone from school put him into that type of thing and have success and they think they're going to continue to have success on a world class level like like you know in any sport. And and he says he had such success at a young age. His dad and his family got really involved into doing that and pushing him in that direction. And that's not always the best scenario and situation. I think sometimes you need to have management and trainers guide you when you're talking about a sport that
*  other people have no idea what's going on. It doesn't work that way. You know like if people think like oh I think family members and I hear this all the time and I can speak from experience my family sometimes comes in and says yeah how come you know you don't make what Conor McGregor is making.
*  It's not the same. I'm like are you fucking kidding me. Like you know like those are it's not the same. You know what I mean. You don't have to explain the entire business. Yeah I don't. Yeah I'd have to explain everything. And so when you have someone like Pico's parent his dad and his you know his brother I think we're kind of helping with management and trying to get
*  sponsors and do this. They were expecting people to like to tell you know to bend over and be like hey you know like yeah this is Aaron Pico and this and that because he's had such success at a young age and how good and talented he was in the gym.
*  But like Alvin Iverson said man we're talking about practice. It doesn't it's not the same thing. You know and he's sure he's great. But when the lights turn on and the fight happens and we're sparring in little gloves not 16 ounce gloves.
*  Okay. It changes the dynamic of the game changes.
*  And you also have to take into consideration that yeah he's had a tremendous amount of success in wrestling and yes he's got very good hands but he has a small amount of MMA fights and this is MMA.
*  And that's the difference. There is a difference. And he's also a really young guy who's experienced some pretty high highs and pretty low lows very quickly.
*  I think guys need to be managed better. And what I mean by that is I mean the same way boxing handles it. Boxing you see guys get to 15 16 and 0 when you see a guy like Khabib was 28 and 0 you know how the fuck.
*  No one gets there. You got John Jones who's essentially undefeated. You know the Matt Hamill fight in my mind. He won that fight. He crushed him.
*  I mean there's never a moment in that fight where he isn't down. He just got disqualified. But and I don't even agree with the disqualification.
*  But he's a rarity. It's him and it's Khabib and maybe there's a couple other guys that are like elite high level guys that are undefeated.
*  They're the outliers. Most guys get thrown the wolves like really quickly.
*  But in boxing you see that all the time because managers slowly groom their fighters.
*  They go OK Josh you know what Josh you're a fucking great puncher but you know your inside game maybe should be tested.
*  We got this tough Mexican dude who likes to fight inside. So we're going to match you up with him. You should beat him but it's going to give you some seasoning and they'll move you along that way.
*  OK we're going to try against a long lanky striker. Sometimes you have problems with the jab and this guy's got a significant reach advantage.
*  And then boxing managers and coaches they'll think about this shit for days and weeks before they commit to a fight.
*  Whereas in the UFC the UFC calls you up. Hey you want to fight Khabib on three days notice. You're like what? And then all of a sudden you're there.
*  Well because boxing managers are usually in cahoots with the promoter. So the two of them work together.
*  That's not the case with any promotion in MMA. Like the promoter is the promoter and the manager is the manager.
*  And you take what we give you and if you don't then OK we'll put you on the shelf for six months.
*  Those type of things have been presented to me a couple of times.
*  And Joe was the manager trying to match make me when I was supposed to fight Anthony Pettis for the title.
*  And he called said hey Pettis is out. He's like yeah we want you to fight some tough Russian guy that I've never heard of.
*  And I was like I just knocked out Nate and I was supposed to fight for the title. I'm not going to fight some tough Russian guy from Dagestan I've never heard of. No thanks.
*  He's like fine I'm going to shelf you for six months. And I just told him hey man I'm pretty good with my money I'll wait.
*  So he just said OK. So the week later I got the Benson fight.
*  That's such a fucked up thing to even say to someone.
*  It is.
*  Yeah it is though. But you know in reality though like look here's the thing and I will say this and I will stick up for Joe even though I just said that.
*  I will stick up for Joe Silva. I met with him shortly after that and he's like look at my phone. You see this? This is your division.
*  He's like you see all these? These are all fighters in the division. He's like you see the ones at the top that you wanted to fight?
*  Yeah all those guys in red? They're hurt.
*  He only had two people to choose from. So and those two people were already matched up against each other.
*  So what do you do?
*  But that's the thing like do you just take a fight because you want to keep fighting.
*  But how does it move your career when you are literally one shot away from the title?
*  Because when you knocked out Nate Diaz first of all you're the first guy to do it.
*  But you did it spectacularly with a head kick. A lot of people forget that for some reason. People keep saying you've never been stopped.
*  It's alright.
*  Go back and watch the tape.
*  I like that you stick up for me. I appreciate that.
*  Always.
*  To make you.
*  Always.
*  But so you're in this crazy position where you're really knocking on the door for a title.
*  Yeah.
*  And then they're saying go fight some savage from the fucking mountains.
*  Yeah it was really good by the way.
*  Oh the fucking Dagestanians. They are the scariest fucking humans on the planet.
*  It's amazing how many tough guys come from that part of the country or the world.
*  They've exploded on the scene and I think it's amazing to see them grow.
*  I think I've seen when he first came in when Khabib first came into AKA I was like he's tough.
*  He's just a wrestler.
*  But he still had some submission defense. Good leg locks.
*  He was physically strong then.
*  He's just gained a lot more confidence now with anything in the gym.
*  Doesn't matter what it is.
*  Like I said I've seen him wrestle with DC. I've seen him wrestle with Luke Rockwell.
*  I've seen him wrestle obviously with myself.
*  He wrestled tons of times. Guys like Greymane and all those guys.
*  And he's phenomenal.
*  When people ask me when you said something about him.
*  Who were you saying?
*  We were talking about him at Lightweight.
*  Oh you were talking about with Joe Burrows.
*  Yeah with him. No him with Usman.
*  I think he out wrestles those guys.
*  Wow.
*  I think he out wrestles them.
*  Yeah 100% I think he out wrestles them.
*  The guy that I thought he would have had a hard time out wrestling would have been Ben Askren.
*  That would have been his guy.
*  I think that guy right there would have been the only guy that I think could have potentially out wrestled him.
*  Ben is hurting now man. You can see how he walks.
*  Yeah.
*  You can see his hip all fucked up. He needs a hip replacement.
*  Yeah he needs to get it done.
*  I mean like that's the thing.
*  But if he does he's never going to fight again.
*  Why? He's done.
*  I think isn't he done?
*  I think he's done because of the hip.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean I don't know what the recovery process is.
*  Is it a hip replacement?
*  Yeah.
*  Or is it just let's scope it all out.
*  Clean it out and see how it goes.
*  No.
*  And then see if he needs a hip replacement after.
*  No he and I discussed it.
*  It's a mess.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah there's a lot of these guys.
*  They're so tough. They're almost too tough for their own good.
*  And they're training on injuries and just pushing through the pain.
*  And they're just chewing up the cartilage and tearing up the labrum.
*  Yep.
*  And I want to.
*  And here's the thing like to go back to the Joe Silva thing.
*  But then a lot of it is because conversations like that.
*  It's the conversation like well fine we're just going to shelf you.
*  Well these guys when they when they get a call for a title.
*  Or they get a call for a fight.
*  Like on the main card or you know.
*  Their families are starving or they're hungry.
*  People think that everyone's making Conor McGregor money.
*  My whole family thought I was making Conor McGregor.
*  Like what's the point of that?
*  I mean I'm not going to be making that money.
*  Why are you not making that money?
*  And I'm like you guys.
*  I almost want to say shut up.
*  Shut up.
*  I don't want to hear it.
*  I've been getting punched in the face for 20 years.
*  I don't want to hear this shit right now.
*  Someone's got a gut and a beer.
*  Yeah.
*  Josh how come you're not making any more money.
*  It's the game man.
*  I never thought about it.
*  Yeah.
*  You know maybe next time I talk to these guys.
*  I'll definitely tell them to give me that Conor McGregor money.
*  Yeah.
*  You know but look what I wanted to talk to you about was like you had a you and Brendan had a talk.
*  In conversation about guys like Lima and other guys having you know competition with top guys.
*  I think Lima's a top guy.
*  I think Michael Chandler's a top guy.
*  I think Bellator has several guys that could compete with anybody in the world.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think the same thing about 1FC.
*  I still maintain to this day Mighty Mouse is probably the best pound for pound fighter on the planet.
*  Probably yes.
*  I mean John Jones has faced stiffer competition because there's stiffer competition in the light heavyweight division.
*  But the way Mighty Mouse was running through the division.
*  The way Mighty Mouse would just not get hit.
*  Yeah.
*  The expression of martial arts in my opinion when I watched him I've never seen anybody more impressive.
*  So what's your take on them him being traded then?
*  I think they offered him a tremendous amount of money at one.
*  And the flyweight division has never been a money maker for the UFC.
*  And Henry Cejudo beat him in a very close decision.
*  And I think they just came to a position where Mighty Mouse was like look I'm not going to make as much money in the next fight.
*  Because I lost.
*  But 1FC is going to pay me X amount of times more than that.
*  And they gave him a huge contract man.
*  Yeah.
*  And they have like Chotry is amazing and what they're doing over at 1FC.
*  I think it's great for everybody.
*  I think it's great for the sport.
*  I think it's great that the athletes have options.
*  I think the competition is great for the UFC.
*  When you see someone rise and someone starts smashing people over there and everybody goes hey that guy might be the best 170 pounder in the world.
*  That's good for everybody.
*  Because then you could set up potentially like a cross promotional fight if someone's that big.
*  And we get to find out.
*  We get to find out who's the number one in the world.
*  That's what it's supposed to be all about.
*  And the more competition there is the more big organizations there are and the more places that athletes go.
*  It's way better for the fighters.
*  And that has to be taken into consideration.
*  Yeah so I worked for one for a while and I work for Bellator now but I was doing case eye commentary for them.
*  And I called a couple of Timothée Nassukens fights.
*  Dude he's a fucking monster.
*  So if you were like I told Jamie I said before you came I said I'm going to call on you a couple of times.
*  When he stopped Alvarez I was like that guy is a fucking killer.
*  He's got dogs in his hands.
*  And I'm telling you right now he either loses by submission in the first round or he knocks you out in the first round.
*  I want to say up until like his 10th fight or 9th fight or something like that he had never gone outside the first round.
*  He either knocked you out or he lost.
*  And his record at the time was 9 or 10 and 1 when I was calling his fights.
*  He had only had one loss and I think he had lost by knockout.
*  But he's got heavy dogs, he's got good hips and takedown defense.
*  The kid is phenomenal.
*  And he's just fucking rock solid.
*  Rock solid everywhere.
*  Fucking super savage in his approach.
*  That guy is, he's elite man.
*  I mean he's elite in terms of you know he could fight anybody in the world that's his size.
*  I really believe, look that guy is a fucking animal man.
*  For him to beat down Eddie Alvarez like that.
*  You're talking about Eddie Alvarez, a guy who's like notoriously one of the toughest fucking guys in the sport period.
*  And that was a real wake up call for a lot of people.
*  There's some guys over there, just because you don't know their name.
*  Doesn't mean like look when fucking Zabik came over here, people didn't know his name.
*  And then they see that guy fight, you're like what the fuck, where'd you come from?
*  360 roundhouse kicks and crazy fucking scissor sweeps and taking people down, submitting them, headkicking them, doing everything.
*  There's hundreds of guys like that out there.
*  They're everywhere.
*  And that's the other thing, they're not just in Dagestan.
*  Sure I think right now that's a market that needs to be tapped into across for every promotion.
*  But they're also in Asia somewhere.
*  They're also in other countries everywhere else.
*  Like you know I do know that there's a lot of top talented guys like in Sweden and Switzerland.
*  They just never get the play because there's not an MMA market there really.
*  But they're great Jiu Jitsu guys, there's good MMA gyms out of all these places.
*  Like in Russia and Italy and all these other places, we're seeing talent come.
*  And when I heard that he was fighting, when I heard Eddie was fighting Nassau Yucca, I was like, oh shit.
*  I said either Eddie's going to be able to get him down and get on top.
*  Because he does tend to fade a little bit Nassau Yucca and gets into the second and third round.
*  But if he can't get him down on that first round, I said he's going to get knocked out.
*  Because Eddie's got, I love Eddie, but he's always, he got a little chinny at some points.
*  Not to the point where he gets knocked out, but you know he's always been rocked, comes back and then fucks people up.
*  But this is a guy that I'd seen him just starch guys.
*  I mean he fought this guy, what was his name, something full along.
*  And there was a talking conversation about this guy was going to knock out Timothy.
*  And I mean I don't think, it was almost like an Alistair Overing type knockout.
*  You know when Ingonen snapped his head back, I'm like oh God, he was out cold.
*  And so when I see guys like him and there's other guys that are in these organizations all around.
*  Like to me, Patricio Pitbull is probably the best 145 pounder in the world.
*  And I'm a big Max Holloway fan.
*  But I've talked about this before with Big John is that styles make matchups.
*  And Big John has talked to me about being in the cage, calling or roughing Max's fights.
*  And he said Volkanovsky will give him problems.
*  And sure enough Volkanovsky gave him problems.
*  He said that will let me know how good Patricio Pitbull would do against Max Holloway.
*  The speed, the wrestling, the power, all those things Patricio has.
*  And to me Patricio is better than Volkanovsky just from what I can see.
*  Not from the Max fight, but from a lead up to all the fights.
*  So I take guys like Lima, I take guys like Patricio who knocked out Michael Chandler at 155 pounds.
*  I take those guys and I'll put those guys against, not just UFC guys, one guys, all these guys all day long.
*  These guys are nasty and they're tough.
*  Who is this right here?
*  This is Patricio Pitbull.
*  So there's Patricio which is the older brother at 155.
*  And then there's Patricio who's at 145 and he's also now the 155 pound champ.
*  But to me look, to me he now, like when I'm talking, like you're talking about Henry Zudel,
*  guys attach themselves to guys because they can make themselves better.
*  I'm not going to go train and stake my claim with someone unless I know the two of us are making each other better.
*  That's his main training partner, Henry Zudel.
*  And that's Henry Zudel, his main training partner.
*  Juan Archuleta was on like a 19 fight win streak and then faced him.
*  Juan Archuleta didn't look like the same Juan Archuleta when he got in there.
*  And when guys are that good at that next level, that's what happens.
*  They make somebody look like they don't belong in there.
*  And that's what happened.
*  And I was like, man, because people keep giving MVP a ton of shit.
*  And I'm like, dude, this guy's that good.
*  Steven Thompson in the beginning wasn't getting any respect either.
*  And look at him.
*  Like he's got, they've got that style of like, oh, I could get him down.
*  I could take him down.
*  I could do this.
*  But guys are so good at their one craft that man, you just can't get to them.
*  And they make these guys look like that.
*  No, no, listen, I'm with you on this and I disagreed with Brendan.
*  Brendan thinks if you're not in the UFC, you're not shit.
*  And I don't, I don't think that's true.
*  Why did he get, I want to know why, why, why?
*  He's got a little Stephen A. Smith in him.
*  Just a touch.
*  Just a sprinkle.
*  Look, he's one of my best friends.
*  I just saw him last weekend in San Jose.
*  I went to his show.
*  But he likes to talk crazy shit too.
*  But he also believes what he's saying.
*  He really does.
*  He believes what he's saying.
*  I disagree.
*  I mean, the Michael Venom page thing is a perfect example.
*  He's so good that Paul Daly turned into a fucking wrestler.
*  Yeah.
*  How crazy is that?
*  I want to tell you a story on that real quick.
*  He goes, Paul Daly murks people.
*  Paul Daly turned to some of the guys at Bellator and go, hey, man, I just want to apologize before he walked out.
*  I just want to apologize.
*  It's going to be a boycott.
*  It's going to be a boring fight.
*  He straight up said that.
*  Really?
*  Straight up.
*  I just want to apologize.
*  This is going to be a boring fight.
*  Wow.
*  That's crazy.
*  But look, if you watch how well Michael Venom page moved in that fight, you almost understand it.
*  Because Paul, with that traditional Thai style.
*  Look, Paul knocked out Lorenz Larkin.
*  Lorenz Larkin is an evil man.
*  He's nasty.
*  He's so good.
*  When you watch him, you watch his style, his movement.
*  I mean, against Neil Magni, throwing those oblique kicks to the body.
*  Who the fuck does that?
*  That one that a lot of guys like to throw to the thigh.
*  He's hitting him in the body like a front kick with that.
*  Blah!
*  And I'm like, Jesus Christ.
*  He's so technical on his feet.
*  He's so sweet on his feet.
*  So you see him get knocked out by Paul Daly, you realize, God damn, that Paul Daly's a motherfucker.
*  That left hand of his is one of the best weapons in the sport.
*  Everybody goes to sleep.
*  And here it is.
*  You see Paul Daly taking him down.
*  And I was like, I can't believe this.
*  The fucking power that he has.
*  Paul Daly's power is, his left hand in particular, one of the scariest fucking weapons in the sport.
*  It really is.
*  He just, you know, probably 36 now.
*  He's not the same guy that he was when he was 25.
*  But the thing is, he's not bad though.
*  No, he's still good.
*  He's still really damn good.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  If we put him back, I'm just saying, if we put him back in the UFC, I'd still say he's probably in the top 20.
*  He's probably in the top five or six.
*  Well, he's always going to have a problem with real wrestlers.
*  Yeah, of course he is.
*  But I also think that his game has always been shaped like guys like John Fitch were able to just grind and grind and grind.
*  But guys like Usman and Kobe, they grind on you, sure.
*  But with John, when he fought him the last time, he just, John's at a different stage in his career where he's not letting go of the leg for anything.
*  Usman and Kobe will make space to throw punches, which could get them in trouble against somebody like him.
*  Because his power in his left hand is fucking nasty.
*  It's just so ridiculous.
*  Like if you see the fight with him when he wobbled or dropped Nick Diaz, Nick Diaz don't get dropped like that.
*  I know.
*  How crazy is Nick Diaz?
*  Nick Diaz forced him into a dog fight.
*  Forced him into a dog fight.
*  And that was one of the most freakish, weirdest knockouts.
*  It was amazing.
*  But the thing is, that was when UFC had first taken over Strikeforce and I was sitting there cage-sized and I'm thinking to myself, this is hands down the greatest MMA one round fight ever seen in my life.
*  It was amazing.
*  It was amazing.
*  Nick Diaz wore him out.
*  He just put that fucking Nick Diaz pace on him and wore him out.
*  But when he clipped him and rocked him and dropped him, I was like, oh my God, Paul Daly's going to stop Nick Diaz?
*  This is crazy.
*  But just the fact that Nick fought him that way.
*  Nick didn't try to take him down, Nick didn't try to submit him, he just went after him.
*  Just like, come on, let's do this.
*  But let's not forget the history of Nick Diaz, man.
*  It all started with Robbie Lawler.
*  The history of Nick Diaz started with Robbie Lawler.
*  Like, come on, motherfucker, I got this.
*  And that's what elevated him to that next level.
*  I called that fight, he walked into the octagon and started yelling, Stalk him, motherfucker, stalk him.
*  And Robbie Lawler's like, what is happening here?
*  What is this?
*  Robbie Lawler was this dark destroyer.
*  Everybody was scared of him.
*  He was a spooky dude.
*  He was flatlining people.
*  And Nick Diaz, not only was he not scared of him, he was talking mad shit to him.
*  He was fighting, he was like, what bitch?
*  What are we doing, bitch?
*  What are we doing, bitch?
*  And people don't understand this.
*  It's so funny, I was talking to Big John the other day on our show and I was saying, hey man,
*  guys, I didn't get so damn tired.
*  When guys talk to me, it stresses me the fuck out, man.
*  I'm like, I just start sweating and I'm like, this is, shut the fuck up, we're supposed to be fighting.
*  I couldn't believe it.
*  I was like, dude.
*  Do you remember when Nick Diaz did that to Frank Shamrock?
*  Yes.
*  And Frank Shamrock was like, I can't believe this is happening.
*  Because it's usually Frank that does it.
*  Yes.
*  I trained with Frank for years and I'm in his garden.
*  He's like, come on, Josh, get up, throw punches, do something, I'm going to fucking sub you.
*  I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that.
*  And you're just like, shut up, man.
*  Shatters want to punch you harder and it makes you more tired.
*  And the fact that Nick was doing it and out cardioing him.
*  Frank's thing was always being the best shape so you could put, like when he beat Tito.
*  Just put that pace on him and Tito couldn't keep up and then he finished him.
*  Yeah, Frank was not the same guy when he fought Nick at that time.
*  But let's be real, like at that time, it was just, it was awesome to see somebody like Nick do that.
*  Because Nick, though, if you can recall, at the end of the fight, he picks Frank up.
*  He's like, you're a fucking legend.
*  Do not sit down there like that.
*  You're a fucking legend.
*  And that's what people talk to me all the time about my fight with Nate.
*  And I say, look, man, I have nothing but respect for both those guys.
*  Those guys are fucking animals.
*  Not only are they animals, but what I love is I love people.
*  We were talking about Big John being a good guy before we came on the show.
*  And Big John McCarthy.
*  And I said, absolutely.
*  And when I think of guys that are good guys, I think of guys that stick by their friends no matter what.
*  You got to remember that brawl that happened on CBS, right?
*  We were talking about that as well.
*  That brawl with Mayhem Miller, Jake Shields, Nick Diaz.
*  But guess what?
*  That whole scrap pack, they die for each other.
*  And you can't knock friendship like that.
*  And I look at those guys and they're really good people.
*  From Gilbert Melendez, his wife, Carrie, Nick and Nate and Jake.
*  Jake's still one of my good, good buddies.
*  Gill is as well.
*  But even though I don't talk to Nate anymore, really.
*  But it's still, I have nothing but respect for those guys themselves.
*  They did it on their own and they're fucking amazing.
*  I will buy their pay-per-view every single time they fight no matter what.
*  Agreed.
*  And you know, Nick Diaz changed the game in terms of his elite cardio.
*  He did something that was a new thing.
*  And that new thing was, he's not going to hit you with 100% power.
*  He's going to hit you with 50%.
*  But he's going to hit you twice as much and you're never going to get to breathe.
*  And he's going to stay on top of you and he's going to talk to you the whole time.
*  So he's going to fuck with you psychologically.
*  He's going to disrupt your breathing by constantly hitting you.
*  And then once he realizes you're hurt, then he's digging to the body.
*  Then he's putting it on you.
*  And on top of that, black belt jiu-jitsu skills, really good wrestling takedown defense,
*  fucking chin made of iron, and an unstoppable will.
*  Like his will to beat you was just unstoppable.
*  When Nick was at the top in StrikeForce, to this day I think he's one of the best fighters that's ever done it.
*  To this day.
*  No, I agree. I think a lot of that unstoppable will though comes from him doing triathlons.
*  I was like, hey, I cannot stop otherwise I lose my time.
*  And I've only got five more miles or eight more miles until I get to the bike.
*  Or until I get to the run.
*  Or until I'm done with the swim.
*  Those are things in your mind as an athlete.
*  You're always thinking like, I'm almost there.
*  Okay, I'm only going to run until the two minute mark.
*  Okay, I'm only going to run until the five minute mark.
*  You set goals for yourself as you go.
*  Shit, I smashed a goal.
*  Okay, one more goal ahead.
*  Those are the things that top athletes do.
*  And I feel like that's what he's done with his career.
*  He used triathlons to help get him there.
*  He was always good, always nasty.
*  Like good jiu-jitsu, great. Phenomenal guillotines.
*  His game has always been really good.
*  His game in boxing and the pace, like you're saying, just the touch, touch, touch.
*  Now bam, bam, touch, touch, touch, bam.
*  That's next level boxing that we hadn't seen in MMA at the time.
*  Yeah, and sparring with Andre Ward on a regular basis too.
*  I mean, he did, look, he did really change things.
*  He really changed things.
*  Particularly with that fucking cardio of his.
*  He has some spooky cardio.
*  Speaking of spooky cardio, let's talk about Tony Ferguson.
*  Okay.
*  That guy's got some, and you have personal experience with Tony Ferguson.
*  Yes, yes.
*  Unfortunately.
*  He's got spooky fucking cardio, man.
*  I give him a real shot against Khabib.
*  I give him a real shot.
*  Okay, so, um, I do and I don't.
*  And I'm not trying to take a dig at him.
*  I actually am a big fan of his, okay.
*  And I was a big fan of his before I fought him.
*  And I did a lot of research on him leading up to the fight.
*  I never really showed him any respect up until like,
*  ah, he's just okay, he's a little sloppy, he's this, he's that.
*  But once I did the research on him leading up to our fight,
*  it impressed me.
*  What impressed me was,
*  dude, the guy can take a shot, give a shot,
*  the guy doesn't slow down,
*  the guy doesn't care where the fight goes.
*  Anytime you have somebody who doesn't care where the fight goes,
*  it changes the dynamic of how you approach him.
*  Because if you take him down, what does that matter?
*  He don't care.
*  He's good with the darts, he's good with the guillotine,
*  he's good with trials, he's good with all those, he doesn't care.
*  So if he stays on the feet, guess what?
*  He doesn't care where the fight goes.
*  He doesn't care where the fight goes.
*  Neither does Khabib.
*  But obviously Khabib would like to keep the fight on the ground,
*  press against the fence,
*  doing work, what he's done,
*  and it continues to work and does what he does best.
*  Look, for me, I feel like the only way that Tony wins is by a cut.
*  I don't think that he can sub him.
*  Now, I'm not going to say that,
*  but I think Tony wins by a cut.
*  I don't think that he can sub him.
*  Now, I'm not going to say that Tony wins by a cut.
*  I think he can sub him.
*  Now, I'm not saying it can't happen.
*  We understand when cuts happen,
*  you get a little more slippery, things slide in a lot faster.
*  Especially in that darts position.
*  He'll hit that darts up from any direction.
*  He'll hit it from his guard, he'll hit it from his butt,
*  he'll hit it from anywhere.
*  So if you're hanging out, if Khabib doesn't put the placement
*  of his head in the right spot,
*  it could be a really, really tough night for him.
*  From being elbowed,
*  from being elbowed and being choked.
*  All the intangibles to become world champion.
*  He's already a former interim champion,
*  which I still consider him the champion at the time.
*  I have nothing bad to say about him.
*  I just think that physically strong he is not.
*  And I'm not knocking him,
*  I'm just simply saying strength wise he is not.
*  But Joe, here I want to shake my hand.
*  His hands will go around yours probably twice.
*  No, he's got such long fingers.
*  That's what threw me off.
*  Honestly, when I shook his hand at the weigh-ins,
*  his fingers wrapped all the way around my hand,
*  almost engulfed my whole hand.
*  I was like, oh shit, you got really big hands.
*  Well that makes the power.
*  No, not just that, but there was a moment there
*  where he had wrist control.
*  So when I got into his guard, he grabbed my wrist
*  and I couldn't get my arm free.
*  And in the meantime, he's elbowing me in my head.
*  And I got two Mercedes-Benz cuts right here on the front of my forehead.
*  So it was like right there.
*  And then he cut me with the good elbow when I stepped in on him.
*  But the two Mercedes-Benz cuts were from him with wrist control
*  and him elbowing me from his guard.
*  If Khabib gets put into his guard,
*  it could end up being a tough fight.
*  Because cuts happen
*  and when they do happen, you have a shaved head.
*  There's nothing stopping them from flowing
*  right into your eyes.
*  Your eyebrows are not going to stop all that blood.
*  And if you recall, remember the Joe Daddy-Stevenson
*  and Eads-Edwards fights?
*  That shit was just squirting out.
*  There's an Adam Piccolotti fight as well in Bellator
*  where he had cut the guy on the top of the head
*  and he's wearing a kink and chokes him.
*  And you see blood go everywhere.
*  And I'm just thinking to myself,
*  in a fight where you shave your head
*  or your hair is always really short
*  it's not going to look good to the judges
*  or to the doctor and things like that.
*  And by the way, Shah brought this up.
*  This fight's in New York.
*  With that fucking lame ass doctor
*  that stopped the Nick Diaz fight.
*  The lame ass doctor,
*  he's got a vagina on his eye.
*  And the guy can still fight.
*  They're being extra cautious in New York right now
*  because it's a relatively new sport, is what I believe.
*  And then I believe they had that death of that boxer
*  that was there.
*  They're just trying to make sure, which I understand
*  the safety of the fighters is most important.
*  Yeah, I would prefer that being in Vegas.
*  In Vegas they let shit go.
*  Although, I think
*  they did check Macy Barber's knee.
*  That was kind of crazy.
*  I thought it was kind of awesome though.
*  I've done that a lot with my therapist.
*  My therapist would be like, yeah, you have probably a great tooth sprain.
*  But you'll be alright.
*  You can tell, if it's torn,
*  your shit's flopping around.
*  But didn't you think it was weird that they were checking her?
*  Remember Tiago Santos? Tiago Santos has zero knees.
*  His knees were gone and he's still swinging haymakers
*  at John Jones.
*  Because he's a fucking savage.
*  Look, at that fight I could see it going to John,
*  but I could also see it going to Santos.
*  Real close.
*  It was like, man, if you hadn't got hurt,
*  how would this fight have been different?
*  You are good, really good.
*  He's fucking dangerous as shit.
*  That power is undeniable.
*  It seemed like he didn't get hurt from anything.
*  It was like a weird thing.
*  He threw a punch and his leg just kind of buckled.
*  Yeah, but you've got to remember though,
*  remember Patrick Cotet did the same thing with Anderson Silva?
*  Carlos Caught it with T Wood.
*  Same thing.
*  He didn't really do anything. It's kind of one of those step backs.
*  Tyron though was a leg kick.
*  Yeah, but he tore it though.
*  Was it from the leg kick or was it just when he got it?
*  Sometimes you know how it is.
*  Sometimes you were a little fucked up going into the fight.
*  Sometimes you just get a little bit of an injury in the fight
*  and then all of a sudden a big leg kick.
*  But Tyron leg kicked him and then his knee blew out.
*  Tyron's legs are like two and one.
*  I've trained with him a couple of times.
*  For someone who is built like a Greek god,
*  he's fucking one of the nicest guys.
*  He's a great guy.
*  I love how smart he is too in terms of his full career.
*  He dips his hands in a bunch of different things.
*  He's rapping,
*  he's doing a lot of TMZ stuff,
*  he's constantly putting up YouTube content.
*  He's on top of shit.
*  So to touch on,
*  I keep bringing up John because John and I talk about a lot obviously.
*  But is fighters after fighting,
*  you need to have a game plan.
*  And I'm not saying it's going to all work.
*  Okay guys, that's the thing.
*  I'm not saying it's going to all work.
*  I own a fitness gym,
*  I own a martial arts gym,
*  I do a podcast,
*  I own a clothing line.
*  But all of them supplement a little bit of the income
*  that I was making for fighting.
*  I think the problem is fighters need to get into dabbling in other things.
*  Look, whether it's a podcast or whether it's
*  owning a gym or anything,
*  I would recommend no gym businesses.
*  It's rough.
*  It's the constant hustle.
*  I've got 15 employees, so it's a lot of work.
*  When you've got that many employees,
*  you have trainers that work for you, front desk people that work for you,
*  I've got Jiu Jitsu coaches that help work and help teach
*  when I'm not there, like they're there now while I'm here with you.
*  And so it's,
*  I owe a lot to them.
*  They run the fort while I'm gone.
*  It's a lot to manage.
*  I get back to the room later today and I get on the computer,
*  look at my cameras like how you have here.
*  You see everything's okay, everything's going good.
*  Plenty of kids came to class today.
*  I've got over 100 kids in my martial arts gym.
*  I've got wrestling, I've got Jiu Jitsu, I've got DC's wrestling program in there.
*  But all that gym
*  business is hard. It's a constant hustle.
*  But you have to remember to ev'nplow.
*  So summers are slow
*  because it's indoors. No one really wants to train during the summer.
*  Everyone's like, I want to go to the beach. I want to go run up the beach.
*  I want to go muscle beach and lift. You know, like those are the things
*  that people who want to go hiking, you know, camping.
*  That's the fitness side of it.
*  The Jiu Jitsu part of it, like sure, the Jiu Jitsu nerds,
*  they're in there. They're going to be there no matter
*  what. You know, kickboxers and things like that.
*  They take the vacation because they want to
*  be outside. Gym business is extremely hard.
*  During the summer you're slow. September, October you pick
*  back up. Holidays you're slow.
*  New Year's you're back to getting busy
*  because New Year's resolutions. Y'all want to be skinny up until May.
*  When it's
*  Memorial weekend and you're all in Vegas, you know,
*  at the pool parties. That's their
*  game plan. So you just got to learn
*  to manage your money and budget your money
*  and figure out things to supplement the income
*  during the times that are slow. That's really what it comes down to.
*  That's a really smart thing for fighters.
*  I mean, Brendan obviously has struck
*  pay dirt with the fighter and the kid and below
*  the belt and all the other shit that he does.
*  And in a lot of ways, and also stand up,
*  in a lot of ways he's opened up the door
*  for a lot of fighters to follow that model.
*  And a lot of guys are doing podcasts now because
*  of that. I mean, Mike Bisping has a really good podcast
*  with Louis Gomez.
*  And, you know, there's a lot of other fighters that are getting involved
*  in setting up similar things too.
*  But I think that's really important to
*  understand that they need some, like, you
*  can't fight forever. It's not possible.
*  So there's got to be something that you're going to do for the rest of your life
*  to make an income. And when you're focused
*  singularly on one thing, being
*  the best fighter that you can be, it's very difficult
*  to even imagine a future without
*  fighting for a lot of these guys.
*  So this is the advice that I gave myself.
*  So my last fight was against
*  Patricio Pitbull, which is Patricio's brother.
*  And, you know, I lost.
*  And when I lost, I kept going to the gym
*  and I was thinking to myself,
*  you know, you're 40 years old,
*  like, you know, what are you going to do?
*  Like, what's next? You know, you're going to fight again.
*  And when the reality
*  set in that, like, if you want to do something else,
*  your new life is going to cost you
*  your old one. You have to have that mentality
*  because I can't keep going to the gym
*  wasting two, you know,
*  four or five hours a day at the gym
*  and still try to start another career.
*  You've got to leave that behind.
*  Whatever it is you're doing, like,
*  in fighting, if you're going to move and do
*  something else, then you need to leave it behind.
*  You have to approach it with the same intensity
*  that you approach your fighting career.
*  And the problem is fighters don't do that. Like, fighters that leave the sport
*  or are going to retire, they're done fighting.
*  They don't do that. They keep hanging on to,
*  I'm going to go to the gym every day, I see all the boys,
*  I'm going to go to the gym every day and hit mitts with my trainer. Why?
*  Get established first and another job.
*  Okay, start making that income.
*  Now, make that your hobby. Go and hit mitts with your coach again.
*  Your coach is going to love you. You're still going to be there.
*  If I call up Javier tomorrow, if he's in town,
*  hey, I want to hit mitts tomorrow at, say, 630.
*  All right, let me move some guys around for you.
*  I only got about five minutes in me to know the mitts.
*  But, you know, it'll make some adjustments for you.
*  Those guys will be there.
*  Those coaches will always be there for you.
*  Go back to it.
*  I can't give any better advice than
*  your new life is going to cost your old one.
*  Let it go. It's okay.
*  Move on, but give the same energy and enthusiasm
*  to your new job or whatever it is you want to do
*  that you did to fighting.
*  And you're going to be great.
*  Well, you have a very intelligent approach about it.
*  But for a lot of guys, it's really hard because
*  fighting is their identity. It's everything.
*  It's who they are.
*  And also the highs, the highs of competition,
*  the highs of victory.
*  They're always chasing that.
*  And then when life gets dull outside of the cage,
*  there's this feeling like, maybe I got one more in me.
*  Maybe I got one more.
*  I think that's a social media play, though.
*  That's what it is. They're in love with the likes.
*  That's what it is.
*  Just scroll around and get the likes. Let me see the hearts.
*  But besides social media, it's been something
*  that fighters have done throughout history.
*  Way before social media. Sugar Ray Leonard did it.
*  Remember when you got knocked out by Hector Camacho
*  and Terry Norris? And when you're like,
*  Ray, get out of there.
*  We've seen it with Roy Jones.
*  It's sad. And Holyfield did it for years.
*  It's just,
*  it is hard to get away from something you've done
*  for your whole life.
*  And no matter what it is, it doesn't matter just fighting.
*  It could be the NFL.
*  You see guys playing, the NBA guys,
*  playing in China, playing in Europe and all these other places.
*  Because they just love it.
*  They love the competition. They love getting up and down the court.
*  They love whatever it is they're doing.
*  I understand that, but
*  you gotta move on.
*  And I don't mean like you gotta leave it behind.
*  You just gotta come back to it later
*  and do something else.
*  You gotta find the next stage of your life.
*  The next chapter.
*  The hardest thing, I feel like realistically,
*  the hardest thing is you're trying to find something
*  that supplemented the income that you were making.
*  I was making really good money.
*  Joe, it takes me a whole year now
*  of work of all four of these other companies
*  to make what I was making in one fight
*  or a fight and a half.
*  You have to understand that
*  there's a means to an end.
*  You gotta make money.
*  Look at HENZO.
*  HENZO GRACIE is a huge school in New York City.
*  Makes a shit ton of money.
*  And got there
*  from his career in fighting in Jiu Jitsu.
*  And figured out how to make
*  more money than he ever made in his entire fighting career
*  every year just doing that.
*  But he also lined himself up
*  with great people. That was the other thing.
*  John Danner is fucking amazing.
*  You go to his class, I went there with Frankie Egger
*  and some of the other guys that were there.
*  I was like, good God.
*  Can I get a little 2x2 space
*  to try the move? Because there were so many damn people there.
*  It was packed.
*  And this class was at like 9.30 or 10.30 in the morning
*  on a Tuesday.
*  I'm like, well don't you guys have jobs?
*  Like, what the fuck?
*  There's so many killers that come out of that gym.
*  It's insane.
*  And just the approach and how HENZO handles his business
*  every time you see HENZO, how is he?
*  He's so friendly.
*  What's up? How you doing?
*  That's what helps generate and drives business.
*  That's the other thing I want to tell young fighters
*  or fighters that are thinking about leaving.
*  Be positive, man.
*  You had a great time being an athlete and a fighter.
*  Move on now. When you move on, keep that same
*  positive energy in everything you do.
*  How you doing? Hey, smile when you walk past people.
*  We don't see that enough in some old bitter fighters.
*  Why? Don't be that way.
*  You were fucking great.
*  Focus on what's next and be positive as you do it.
*  I think everything will be great.
*  It's hard for guys to accept the new chapter in their life.
*  You know what another parallel is?
*  Hot chicks. When hot chicks get older,
*  some of them just have a hard time letting it go.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It's just like, god damn, you used to be
*  the thing you would walk by and every guy would be like,
*  holy shit, and now you're invisible.
*  And for a lot of women, that's a
*  devastating transition in their life.
*  For a girl who's an average girl,
*  an average looking girl, it's not as hard.
*  When you get older,
*  you were never a show stopper to begin with.
*  But there's something about
*  show stoppers, it's just a gift
*  from the universe. A gorgeous girl,
*  it's just a gift.
*  You just got fantastic genetics.
*  It's really all it is.
*  This facial symmetry,
*  the way your body's built,
*  there's a lot of girls that are show stoppers,
*  they don't even have to work out.
*  It's almost like the universe takes that gift away.
*  It's almost worse than having never had it.
*  And for fighters, sometimes it's the same way.
*  Because as you get older
*  and you're living a regular life with a regular job
*  with a lot of people to be happy with,
*  you're not happy with it because you remember
*  being a conqueror.
*  You remember being the guy that gets his hand raised
*  and have thousands of people screaming and cheering.
*  You remember the after fight party.
*  You remember training, you remember walking
*  in the gym and everybody goes, that's the fucking man right there.
*  Yeah, the sport will be on after you.
*  It was there before you and it'll be there after you.
*  Every athlete needs to remember that.
*  And as far as with women,
*  women go through the baby fat stage like kids do.
*  They go through the baby fat stage.
*  When they're younger, I feel like they haven't fully matured.
*  I feel like when you look
*  and I want to say women don't hit their prime
*  until that 32 to 36, 37 year old,
*  you see them, I'm like, god damn.
*  Then they become a woman.
*  They become a woman and they are absolutely beautiful.
*  I'm telling you,
*  you look at Jennifer Aniston when she was probably
*  in her 30s, early 30s or late 20s,
*  you see her
*  when she was in that 40 age,
*  good god, just way different.
*  J.Lo, same thing when she was younger versus
*  they take care of themselves.
*  But I think a majority of women though,
*  between that 32 to 36, 37,
*  that could be their sexual pee,
*  that's the hot spot, I really believe.
*  Because look, there was a lot,
*  there was some girls that I knew,
*  some girls that I knew that were ring girls.
*  And when they first started on,
*  they weren't as beautiful as they are now
*  as they've gotten a little bit older.
*  The other thing as well is sometimes though,
*  they were pretty with natural looks when they started
*  and now all of a sudden they've got so much work done,
*  they don't even look like the same person.
*  So there's two sides to that.
*  Just let your body mature
*  before you go sticking that shit in your face.
*  And I'll bet you you're going to be
*  beautiful no matter what.
*  You start putting that shit,
*  you look like every other person that's on social media.
*  It drives me insane to see that
*  because it's just,
*  you guys all have the same doctor, I can see.
*  Also you see girls in their early 20s
*  getting their face shot up.
*  Yeah, they're not even done, their body's not even done growing.
*  They're physically filling out
*  and I'm thinking, gosh.
*  They want to fill their cheeks in with those fillers
*  and all that stuff? Yeah, it's a bummer.
*  But yeah, it's,
*  I like one of the things that Bellator
*  and the UFC is doing is
*  employing former fighters
*  to do commentary
*  and to do analysis of fights.
*  Bellator does a fantastic job with you guys
*  and the UFC does it as well.
*  Fighters as commentators
*  and I think that's a great avenue.
*  And that's something that's going to be around for a long time.
*  And if you're good at it, you're very good at it.
*  I really enjoy you doing it.
*  It means a lot coming from you. I appreciate it. Thank you.
*  You're great. But it's such a great thing
*  that they've done and it's amazing
*  that they hadn't done that before.
*  And now boxing has caught on.
*  I mean, boxing had it with George Foreman and a little bit with Roy Jones Jr.
*  But for the most part, the people that are doing commentary,
*  they were analysts, you know?
*  And you'd have like one fighter.
*  But the guys sitting around the table
*  talking about what they think about
*  these matchups and what they think could go down,
*  that's very valuable insight to the fans too.
*  It enhances the experience for the fans
*  and provides a future career for fighters.
*  George Foreman to me, it was one of my favorites
*  because he had the best line ever when he told
*  Larry Merchant, you see fighting, you don't know fighting.
*  And that to me, just let everyone know
*  I'm going to put you in your place
*  without actually throwing a punch.
*  You know what I mean? And just let me know
*  that fighters are meant to be in that position.
*  And so when you're saying guys like DC stepping up
*  and doing what he's doing, I think he's amazing.
*  He's fantastic.
*  I love doing what I do and I got to tell you,
*  I've been definitely blessed the fact that
*  I owe a big majority of my career to Scott Coker.
*  Because these are things that sure I had to audition for.
*  I still had to get out there
*  and do what they asked me to do.
*  When it came down to the audition,
*  you have to be able to nail it.
*  And I was lucky enough that they were like,
*  eh, you're good enough, we'll give you a try.
*  But I feel that the reason I think
*  why it worked out so well is
*  situations like this.
*  I started a podcast, I was already comfortable
*  being in front of the mic.
*  This is one of the things that I got from Brendan
*  when I went on his show the first time
*  on Big Brown Breakdown.
*  I'm like, talk to me about how this whole thing did
*  and how it all started for you.
*  He goes, Josh, just look at this microphone
*  as if it's a rep. Every time you're in front of this microphone
*  it's a rep that you're getting for the shows that you're going to do.
*  And so when I get now in front of the microphone
*  and I'm holding it there
*  and I'm talking with Jay Glazer
*  and Chael and whoever else, whatever fighters,
*  one of the hardest things to do
*  is listen to what the hell they're saying.
*  You know, like, when you're,
*  this is why I admire what you do so well.
*  You're talking to me and I have to listen to you
*  and you're listening to everything I say so you can come back with an answer.
*  Most people already have a question
*  in their head they're going to ask
*  and they don't care what you're going to say.
*  And so when you're talking to a fighter, right,
*  they generally will, well, for me
*  I did it like this and I did it like, well, you can't do that.
*  Well, at that moment you've got to make it about the fighter.
*  It's like Jiu-Jitsu. If you're only thinking about what you want to do to a person
*  then you're not thinking about what they're going to do to you
*  you're going to get surprised.
*  You have to flow.
*  And the conversation is like flow.
*  You have to be able to listen and you've got to be able to respond
*  and if you're not listening, you're just talking at that person.
*  The people at home are going,
*  this is awkward, and they don't like it.
*  Yeah, because now I'm just artificially
*  putting in questions that you weren't even talking about
*  and it just sounds really bad.
*  So when I had done the audition for Bellator
*  down in Viacom Studios
*  they had sat me in a silent room.
*  It was kind of like a room like this
*  with a monitor and I had to call Ed Roos fight.
*  And I already knew that Ed knocked the guy out.
*  It was very awkward. I was like, oh man.
*  That's how they auditioned you?
*  That's how they auditioned me.
*  I called this fight and I was like, oh man, this is,
*  I already know the result. And I was like, yeah, so I think Ed,
*  what he needs to do is set up that right hand and boom, knockout.
*  I was like, yes, I knew I was right.
*  It was like one of those scenarios and situations.
*  But we did that and then there was
*  some other stuff too where they had
*  someone Goldie do something
*  and I had to answer questions with him.
*  There was a lot of things that came along.
*  But that was part of the audition.
*  And then I did a show with Brennan Schaub
*  at the Bellator's show in New York.
*  So it was him and I with Jen Brown
*  at the desk.
*  And the three of us were up there and that was the first show
*  I'd ever done at a desk ever sitting.
*  And so that was something
*  that I learned a lot from Brennan. I learned a lot from
*  Jen and I learned a lot from talking with Big John
*  and Goldie and all the guys that were there.
*  Morrow is phenomenal when it comes to me talking with him.
*  He's amazing.
*  He's a great guy. I've never seen anyone
*  right out.
*  I don't know if you've ever seen his iPad.
*  His iPad has stuff. I have no idea how he can visually see it.
*  He types it all up and the writing
*  is so small that my normal eye can't
*  read it. He's got glasses on.
*  But he'll read it one time and then he'll recite
*  the whole thing. He's got a photographic memory.
*  Without a doubt he's got a photographic memory.
*  I tell you not, he'll read it all
*  and then when we do rehearsals for the shows
*  he does this walk down where he walks
*  and he introduces all of Bellator and like
*  hey fans, everything live.
*  Like on TV live and all he
*  he's not carrying his iPad
*  or his phone or notes or anything.
*  He just recites it.
*  Word for word, verbatim like he did in rehearsals
*  every single time. The guy's an animal.
*  He's a machine.
*  And kid you not, he does Showtime
*  he does WWE and he does Bellator.
*  It's crazy to think of.
*  All the things he does and he's just on his
*  like
*  I love how open
*  he is about mental health issues.
*  About his own struggles and
*  trying to let people know. The bipolar rock
*  and roller he calls himself.
*  I watched that on a plane ride
*  overseas. I think I was going to Milan
*  and I watched that and I never had realized
*  the severity of what he
*  would go through before and after shows.
*  Until you see that you don't realize what
*  mentally they go through.
*  Like man you sucked, you did this, you fucked it up.
*  He's yelling at himself in the mirror after.
*  You knew it should have been this.
*  He misses a word.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It's a tough job man.
*  I only did that once, that play by play thing
*  the play by play commentator
*  gig once with Phil Barone.
*  Me and Phil did it. It was fun.
*  It was fun working with Phil. We had a good time.
*  But that play by play spot is fucking hard man.
*  That's a different thing.
*  Sometimes you got to take them in and out of commercials.
*  You got to take them in and out of rounds.
*  You're running traffic.
*  You're directing everything. It's fucking hard man.
*  It's way harder than color.
*  Color you're just sitting there.
*  If a fight starts happening
*  you're just describing what's happening.
*  You know what's happening. You know how to talk.
*  It's not that hard. But to be able to do that
*  play by play shit like John Anik is a goddamn
*  wizard. John Anik is the best I've ever seen.
*  I've never seen anybody like him.
*  He's so smooth. He's the right amount of
*  talking, the right amount of laying back.
*  He doesn't ever overstep his
*  bounds in terms of his knowledge base
*  and what he understands and doesn't.
*  He's got a great sense of humor. Great guy.
*  I got to tell you when he first came on to the scene
*  at UFC I was like
*  I don't know.
*  But then I'm being honest.
*  But I got to tell you he's grown on me.
*  I actually truly like
*  listening to him call fights and I love
*  when his interviews are good. Everything he does is great.
*  Do you know him as a person? No I don't.
*  I've met him in Hey How Are You but I don't know him.
*  He's fucking amazing. But everything
*  I've ever heard. DC Talks is so highly of him.
*  He's one of the greatest guys.
*  Super nice guy.
*  Yeah in the beginning I was like
*  you know. But then as he
*  started calling more fights and as he started
*  and I think when I started seeing some
*  of the front camera angles
*  that you got that the UFC does for
*  like your guys reaction. Yeah. That's when I
*  actually started really liking him. He's just
*  like
*  he loves it. Yeah.
*  And those are things that you want to see from your guys.
*  Those are things that you want to see from people that they love
*  the sport and they're in it balls deep.
*  They want to be the
*  they want to know the sport. I'm working with a guy right now
*  over in the UK because I handle all the UK
*  series for Bellator.
*  So I call all the fights cage side there.
*  And so I work with this guy named Dave Ferrara
*  and he I kid you not from the
*  first day we worked together. We meshed
*  and he was great. Like and he's like hey man
*  I don't know any of the submissions. I don't know this or that.
*  I said let me focus on that.
*  You worry about selling
*  boom this shit happened. You know like. Right.
*  And so after the very
*  we did the very first fight and he tried to he
*  said something about a kill team or something. I was like you.
*  I said don't after the fight
*  I said don't say that. I said he was on his back. It's a real naked
*  so I was just one
*  of those situations. But then after that he
*  never he never. But he also went
*  to a couple of Jiu Jitsu gyms and
*  started asking didn't take class but he started asking
*  about what submission those that what's
*  so he could start kind of do and he did his research
*  came back and had studied had
*  had known what the guys were doing how they had won
*  fights what it was. So you know
*  so have he's just ever since we've done
*  a show he's progressively gotten better and
*  better and better. He's really good.
*  I love working with the guy. It can you know
*  it can be a daunting task to step
*  into that world that you don't really understand
*  you're not a practitioner. Yeah. And then to be
*  a commentator for look there's one
*  thing about MMA fans if you don't know what
*  the fuck you're talking about they will come down on
*  you like a ton of bricks. It's hard.
*  No it's true. They can get rough and they appreciate
*  they
*  appreciate someone who's genuine like that's one
*  of the things you're saying when you saw his enthusiasm
*  when Anik you look at a video of him reacting
*  to fights genuine enthusiasm
*  is appreciated because you know
*  there's so many fans and they
*  everyone knows how to talk and everyone knows
*  how to talk about fights. They
*  like fuck I could do that. So if you're doing it
*  you're not interested in it or it's not really your thing
*  they get mad at you. No it's true like
*  you need to make sure that you're you're
*  as an analyst
*  I think as an analyst I had to
*  realize that it's not
*  about you anymore. You're not that guy in the cage.
*  Right. OK. It's about the guys that are in
*  that cage. You got to make them
*  bigger than light. You got to make them
*  feel not just feel but I got to sell them to
*  the world. Yes. That this guy is the best
*  guy. And so when I have these conversations
*  like with you and when I'm on my podcast talking about
*  guys like Patricio and Lima
*  and MVP and you know and Gagar Musasi
*  and those guys being as good as UFC and
*  good as as good as one
*  FC guys. I have to I'd say it because
*  I mean it. Yeah. But I'm not going to try to
*  push somebody on somebody that I don't believe that in
*  I just truly think that there's guys
*  all around the promotions every person
*  that deserve that are the best that are the best
*  we just haven't found. There's probably some guy up in the fucking
*  mountains in Dagestan who's the world class best
*  guy in the world but he just can't find his way to a
*  paved road. Right. You know what I mean. So he doesn't
*  so he's probably the best but no he just doesn't know how to get
*  there. It's no different than when we watch
*  America. Have you ever watched American Idol
*  and how can you know how can you know how you're not a star
*  yet. Well because I don't know how the business works.
*  I don't know how to get in front of people that can make me a
*  star. Yes. That goes with any that goes
*  with all the fighters to how do I get
*  in the UFC. I don't know.
*  That's the thing. You got to find a way in
*  and if they don't know how to get in then they're stuck
*  living in the woods somewhere and you know
*  trying to. And if they don't see that clear
*  path they might not have the same level of commitments
*  and they might slack off or find something else to do.
*  Very true. It's
*  and we started about this
*  because Brendan was saying that if you're not in the UFC
*  you're not shit. Yeah. I mean I think that's
*  a crazy perspective because when I look at
*  like we're talking about Lima like there are
*  guys out there like I look
*  at Lima and I go he might be able to beat everybody.
*  I really believe that. That guy's fucking terrifying.
*  The way he knocked out Michael Venom Page. Yeah.
*  I'm like look he might be able to beat everybody.
*  To say no. Like come on
*  man. Watch that guy fight. Look at his
*  fucking power. Look at the way he knocked out Koroshkov.
*  Look at those fucking leg kicks man. He tortures
*  guys with those leg kicks. He's so powerful.
*  Let's. Here's the thing though.
*  Let's not forget when Roy left
*  he was still one of the top guys in the UFC.
*  Okay. And just because and
*  look I don't know I'm not trying to like dig
*  or dog. But what Dana does very well
*  is he develops the narrative
*  and then the media runs with that narrative very well.
*  So they they before he even
*  before they even put pen to paper
*  Dana's already wrote the story for
*  them because he know he's already gave him the narrative
*  like you and I are talking about it earlier with Connor.
*  Yeah.
*  He made Donald Cerrone.
*  He calls him to lose in 40 seconds.
*  Dana came out and said it's not that
*  Connors or Cowboys bad. It's that Connor
*  looked that good. That narrative was written
*  for all the media to go ahead and follow because that's
*  before they wrote pen to paper. That's what the
*  narrative was. He wrote the narrative for them.
*  I just feel that like look there's
*  guys out there that can cross boards all
*  across. Nima is one of them.
*  Patricio is one of them. There's guys I think in 135
*  pounds that we have that can do
*  it as well. We've got tons of guys not just
*  us even in one. But I would put
*  our guys I would understand. I say our
*  but I just say because I came from Strike Force
*  and we got no respect
*  man. It was so hard Joe
*  to try force guys integrated with the UFC
*  and we realized like how many of them became champions
*  Luke Rockhold and how many of them were
*  world class guys. Moosasi
*  Tim Kennedy. So many
*  guys came over from Strike Force. You have to
*  remember this is I've been getting criticized
*  for years. Not criticized.
*  I've been being told I've been told for years
*  that I was never a top guy for years
*  because I was in Strike Force. And I said well
*  I also know what the guys
*  in UFC are making and I'm making more in Strike
*  Force. So I'm going to stay here. Like at the end
*  of the day to me it's about making money.
*  Right. Like this is this is I'm
*  a prize fighter. Let's talk about that. Isn't
*  it weird though that like this is the only
*  sport MMA is the only sport
*  where you have these names
*  of these organizations and they're
*  more like boxing. Nobody gives a fuck
*  if it's a WBC title or the WBO
*  title. They don't care. They care.
*  Is it Deontay Wilder? Is he
*  fighting? I want to see him fight Tyson
*  Fiori. I don't give a fuck if it's for the bubble
*  gum title. It doesn't mean anything to me.
*  But for MMA
*  for some reason
*  because the promotions become
*  like the NFL or the NBA
*  it becomes the big thing. We know there's
*  world class fighters everywhere. It's not
*  like basketball or football where the best
*  guys are definitely playing in the NFL.
*  There's so many different organizations and
*  I almost feel like fighters
*  are hampered by the names
*  of these promotions. I almost think like
*  we'd all be better off if it was just
*  MMA. You know to call it the UFC.
*  The problem with that
*  is it's great because everybody knows
*  there's a very high quality to the UFC events.
*  The production value is amazing.
*  There's so much attached to it and so much
*  history. But at the end of the day
*  it's about MMA fights. That's what it's about.
*  And whether it's in Bellator
*  or 1FC it's about
*  how good are these match ups?
*  How good are the fighters? What am I going to see?
*  Well I believe it all
*  started when
*  I believe it all started
*  when credentials were taken away
*  from top MMA media organization
*  or websites and saying hey
*  we don't like what you say
*  you're not going to get a credential to get in.
*  So then they replaced, they brought
*  in the other media
*  websites or whatever it was USA Today
*  whatever it was other media sites that came in
*  and just said it's all about UFC.
*  It wasn't a sport anymore. It was a UFC
*  brand and we had the best fighters.
*  And once you took away SureDog's credentials
*  you know all the other people that were doing
*  what other companies at that time
*  had webs, they took those credentials away.
*  Now whoever came in was like well shit
*  they're going to do it to those big time
*  MMA websites. Why would they
*  do the same shit to me if I don't tow the line?
*  And that all of a sudden became like
*  fighters now when you see them
*  it's all about UFC. It's not
*  about anything that they're doing.
*  You as a fighter I think
*  even though it's an individual sport and sure
*  you guys should be pumping your organization I get it
*  but you should also be pumping you because
*  after you're done the UFC will be fine.
*  You need to worry about building your
*  brand whatever it is you do to make you
*  big and
*  I'm all for the organization. The organization
*  does a lot for fighters. I'm not here to piss on
*  any company or any organization.
*  They need to make sure though that they're doing what they can
*  to make as much money as they possibly can.
*  And to go back to the strike force thing I was making
*  almost double what the guys were making
*  in the top five in the UFC at the time.
*  Now there was a lot of talk about backroom bonuses
*  and this and that but I was privy
*  to a couple of those back year bonuses when we got
*  bought out and I went over there. They were
*  not what I was making on the other side of the rope.
*  So just to give you an example when I came over
*  they were like oh wow you're making that. They were like
*  whoa what do we got to do? We only have one fight
*  left and I was like well you got to match or
*  at least beat it. You know like what I'm making now.
*  And in the thought process
*  where the fuck am I going to go though Josh? You're kind of
*  fucking stepping on your own dick here.
*  It's tricky right because you can't really negotiate
*  correctly. No I couldn't really
*  negotiate at the time and I was just like shit.
*  Alright well let's play this out.
*  So I took the least amount of fights I could possibly
*  take wondering if
*  Bellator was going to be around long and
*  if Scott was going to stick with UFC or if he was
*  going to try to go do his own promotion again.
*  A lot of my relationships
*  come from people that have been around with. Koger to me is
*  I think one of the best guys
*  if not the best guy I've ever done
*  business with. I've learned a lot from watching him
*  and how he approaches not just fighters
*  but the promotion itself. You know
*  the one thing I admire the most about him is that
*  you just don't, you don't need to shit
*  on other people like the UFC or
*  one to say that my organization is the best.
*  He takes that martial arts attitude
*  and approach to a lot of things.
*  And he never, I've never heard him say
*  bad things about Dana White. Never in a public
*  private conversation and I
*  have golf with, I play golf with them a lot. I have
*  lunch with them a lot. I've never once heard
*  him say anything bad about Dana White or anybody
*  else at the UFC. That's not his approach.
*  His approach is I'm going to have fights.
*  I'm going to try to make my guys that are fighters
*  as much money as I can and my organization
*  is going to do something that we're going to do and let them
*  do what they're going to do. I appreciate that. Yeah
*  he's a very universally loved guy.
*  I would really like cross promotion fights.
*  I really would. Well Bellator just did it with
*  Ryzen. Yeah. You know and what's your take
*  on that? I think it'd be good for everybody.
*  Like I said I'm obsessed with Douglas Lima
*  fighting at 170 pounds.
*  Have you not seen Patricio fight? Yes.
*  Look I'm obsessed with Patricio too but I
*  look I feel like right now 145
*  in the UFC is so fucking talent stacked.
*  I'm comfortable with some of these matchups
*  that I want to see. I really am interested
*  in seeing a rematch
*  between Volkonovsky and Max Holloway.
*  I think Max Holloway with just a few adjustments
*  checking those leg kicks and maybe a little bit
*  more movement. He you know
*  I think he can win that fight. But I think Volkonovsky
*  with a few adjustments might be able to put on even better
*  performance and now that he's beaten the
*  goat featherweight. I mean who knows.
*  I mean a lot of guys you don't really see what they're
*  capable of until they win the title and then
*  you see the conference take over. I mean
*  I think cross promotion with all the champions
*  would be fantastic. I mean
*  look I'm a terrible business person.
*  Obviously. Obviously. I'd promote
*  everybody. I'd be like fuck yeah Bellatoria
*  let's be friends. I'll blow you guys up too.
*  I wouldn't I don't think the way
*  the UFC does is sort of an isolationist
*  perspective. Like when Fador was a champion
*  they would get bummed out that I kept
*  mentioning him. When Fador was over in
*  pride and I was like you got to take any consideration
*  Fador Emilianenko. I mean he might be the best
*  fucking heavyweight alive. And there was a lot of guys
*  over there that were fucking phenomenal fighters and
*  we absorbed a few of them and
*  there was some problems with that. You know obviously
*  there was problems with the fact that the contracts
*  that they got from pride a lot of them weren't real.
*  So you know there's we thought we had Fador
*  and we didn't. We thought we had a lot of guys. They had to
*  just put him under new contracts. Mark Hunt was
*  a good example. He wrote out his contract
*  and then there was a problem with supplements. You know a lot of those
*  guys were on the Mexican juice. But because
*  it wasn't in the contract. I fought over there and they said
*  we do not test for steroids like in the contract
*  and it's in anyway. So tell me that it was in a giant
*  bold print. Yes it was. It was.
*  It actually was.
*  I want to even say it was underlined.
*  It was like no look. So
*  I agree with cross promotion.
*  I want to see that. I 100 percent want to see that.
*  But I also think though too you got to look out for all promotions.
*  If we're going to cross promote let's not have
*  champion versus champion. Let's have your number two guy
*  versus this number three guy. Let's make the best
*  fight. Here's the thing. Do you think it would hurt the UFC?
*  Because I don't know if it would.
*  I think it would definitely help Bellator.
*  I hate the name Bellator.
*  I think everyone did. And honestly I think
*  everyone did. It was true.
*  But here's the thing. They'd already spent millions
*  probably close to over a billion dollars
*  and trying to make sure that it was marketed properly back
*  then. When Scott came in it's like let's
*  not try to rebrand this. Scott's brilliant
*  when it comes to doing these type of things.
*  But you notice how he got rid of the
*  he made it very simple. The logo is simple.
*  Everything is simple now. And it's easier to say
*  oh that's our logo right there versus this big
*  word that says with like a
*  I don't even know what it was behind. It was like a Bellator
*  fighter or whatever it was. Yeah it went away.
*  Gone. So like he
*  look at all these things it takes time to get branded.
*  Do you remember King of the Cage when they used to have the
*  King of the Cage? A giant bodybuilder dude?
*  Yes. Who was like the mascot?
*  Remember how strange that was?
*  Shout out to Terry Trovelcock. That guy.
*  Look he's been around forever. Forever.
*  Still around. Terry's still around.
*  You gotta appreciate guys like that.
*  Even though he's not getting rich but he's also making
*  sure that young and up and coming fighters have
*  a way to get their name out there
*  and still fight at a high level.
*  You know Bud Brutsman was one of the owners as well.
*  He's a really good friend of mine. He actually sold him my old house.
*  He lives in my old house. He's a real good friend of mine.
*  I never met him I don't think. But.
*  Bud and Terry were partners in that adventure.
*  And they used to have this guy
*  who was this enormous fucking bald
*  bodybuilder dude who was the
*  King of the Cage. And he was like
*  a mascot. You remember?
*  He was always wearing like a dry fit shirt
*  or like a really tight. A really tight.
*  Jack. Big ol' fucking neck.
*  Bald guy. Huge muscles.
*  But it was so strange. It was like but he's not
*  the fighter. This is so weird.
*  Like you have a mascot.
*  Hey whatever man. Everyone's gotta try something
*  different. Mascots are weird.
*  It's a fighting mascot. Cause I remember the UFC
*  had the dude who was the bald
*  muscular guy in the logo.
*  Do you remember that? Was that you? No!
*  He was laughing at me.
*  It looked like Boss Rootin.
*  Do you remember the early days of the UFC?
*  The logo had this guy who was
*  this bald jack dude.
*  And that was like a part of the UFC logo
*  with some bald dude. Yeah yeah yeah. I do remember that.
*  It was weird. It looked like Boss.
*  Like when Boss won the title. I was like
*  is this destined for you? Like look at this.
*  It was really weird.
*  There it is. Look at that fucking old logo.
*  That's true. How weird is that?
*  No one like that ever won the title up until Boss.
*  But that's like so when Scott came in he changed
*  the logo to make it simple. Like basically
*  what Dana and Lorenzo and those guys did.
*  Basically made it simple like that.
*  So I think it's good for the sport.
*  We'll see. Like look the name itself is like hey do we want
*  to rebrand this? No. You don't want to waste all the money
*  you did trying to rebrand a new organization.
*  That's just too hard. And you know at the end of the day
*  it's you know the execs talk and they're like
*  hey let's just try and make some changes. Make it simple.
*  And no one just fall in love with us all over again.
*  But you know for a different reason.
*  The other thing too even though we are doing a tournament format
*  for our fights we're not doing them
*  every like Bellator before. We're doing them every Friday.
*  Different weight class and I never
*  paid attention because it was just too hectic to try and keep up.
*  Now you have big fights scheduled
*  you know every once a month
*  with the tournament fighters.
*  So like this weekend we have Cyborg fighting
*  Julia Budd for the title which is phenomenal.
*  Very under looked fight.
*  Yeah Julia Budd's a monster. She's an animal.
*  And I mean people are and it's funny because
*  everyone just keeps overlooking her and
*  she's so jacked. And she's not only is she jacked
*  she's got her wrestling has gotten a lot better.
*  And I need to remind you guys her only two losses
*  have been to Amanda Nunes and Ronda Rousey
*  when Ronda Rousey was at the top of her game.
*  Now those two losses those two were extremely early
*  in her career. She's been on a terror ever since
*  then and she's been doing phenomenal.
*  I've had again talking
*  with John him and I have talked her it's her
*  confidence. Her confidence needs to be
*  at a different level.
*  Look at the fucking guns on that chick.
*  Her striking I think is better
*  than Cyborg.
*  Yes I think it's better. Her striking is better
*  than Cyborg. Now that's a bold statement.
*  Can she take a shot from Cyborg?
*  Who knows. But I think there's a lot to be said.
*  Like Cyborg doesn't throw the straightest punches
*  in the world. You know she throws a lot of hooks.
*  So if Julia can pressure to the fence get inside the
*  clinch make her that dirty get in that dirty boxing
*  get rid of those loopy punches
*  and be inside that pocket right there
*  then I think she's got a good chance.
*  Well after Cyborg got flatlined by Amanda Nunes
*  the whole game just changed.
*  Everything changed. You know you realize.
*  Oh okay okay. Well first of all
*  Nunes has fucking hammers.
*  That lady throws hammers.
*  It's crazy. It's crazy how fucking bad ass
*  she is. I look at it though too that
*  Cyborg had been undefeated for so
*  long. Hadn't lost in so long.
*  That she's just like I'm just going to walk through this
*  chick. And it just cost her. I think her confidence
*  was that none of these girls can hurt me.
*  I could beat her. You know and when she got hit
*  I'm going to hit you back. She was thinking she was
*  going to impose her will like she did against everyone
*  else. Okay. And she's going to try to do the same thing
*  to Julia Budd. And
*  it's a matter of how Julia Budd
*  responds. And we're going to know I think in that first round
*  whether Julia is going
*  to rise to the occasion or
*  she's going to step back and let Cyborg dictate
*  the pace like a lot of other girls have.
*  I think with Amanda when she pushed Amanda
*  back Amanda hit her and
*  Cyborg got rocked and Amanda pressed forward and she
*  thought she was going to hit her back and it became this exchange.
*  It was a very sloppy fight I think from
*  both sides. But Amanda has big
*  dogs and was able to land the clean good punches.
*  And timing. The timing.
*  What she did very well in that fight was that she made
*  sure that she didn't blow her wad
*  and wasteless punches. She was picking
*  and choosing her shots. So she was making sure
*  that they were landing versus just throwing
*  aimlessly and not landing. You see that
*  a lot of times people get rocked and the guy just
*  comes and smothers himself so much that nothing
*  lands and the guy recovers and you're back to fighting.
*  Yeah. You know when I knew
*  that Amanda Nunes was a fucking dangerous
*  dangerous fighter was first of
*  all the first round went
*  well you know there's a lot of fights
*  where you saw it. You know you started to
*  see it with Kat Zingano. The first round
*  she almost had Kat Zingano out. But then she
*  faded and then she got put away
*  later in the fight which just shows how tough Kat Zingano
*  was. Kat Zingano is a fucking savage.
*  She's at Bellator now. Yes I know. I'm very happy to see her
*  over there. But when Amanda Nunes
*  beat the fuck out of Misha Taiten and strangled her
*  I was like oh god damn. Yeah.
*  Jesus Christ. And then when Raquel
*  Pennington fights an under looked fight because
*  Raquel Pennington is as fucking tough
*  as they come. That lady impresses
*  the shit out of me. And the fact that she
*  was able to stop her and beat
*  her down before she stopped her.
*  You know you just you realize she was on another level
*  at that point in time. But still
*  when the cyborg fighter had questions I was like
*  look what she did to Holly Holm. Cyborg just bullied
*  Holly Holm. She was just on top of her
*  beating her down and Holly is a phenomenal
*  striker. And I was like man is Amanda
*  but the difference is Amanda is her hands.
*  Holly you know has good
*  power in her hands. Excellent timing. Good
*  counters. But Amanda has like legit
*  one shot knockout power. Yeah
*  I agree. I just would have liked to have seen
*  them do a second fight because I think
*  I think that Cyborg would have fought a smarter
*  fight and it would have been a different outcome.
*  She would have made the adjustments. Yeah she would have made the
*  adjustments not just made the adjustments but we saw what Jermaine
*  DeRonimie when Jermaine fought her. Then Amanda as the
*  fight goes on she's not the same fighter. Why do
*  you think that she decided to move
*  over to Bellator? Why do you think she didn't pursue
*  the rematch? Oh you know the answer to that. Come on
*  Joe. She's not just you can't
*  I think the comments this the
*  being treated like there you know certain ways people
*  talking behind her back saying you know calling her
*  you know a man whatever it was. Those are there's
*  not just that but then also to a little
*  bit of them I think some of the mistreatment
*  in that in that whole thing.
*  The other thing as well let's not like all that
*  stuff aside. She's got
*  a relationship with Scott Coker. She had it from
*  Strikeforce and they've always got along.
*  He's always he's always amped her and got to remember
*  he's the one that first put women's MMA on the
*  on the on the big stage.
*  You know her and Gina Corona were the ones
*  that made women's MMA that next level
*  of what what it
*  was also there was something that happened between
*  them where the UFC was like we're getting out of the Cyborg
*  business. I'm trying to remember what it was.
*  I don't remember what happened but there was some
*  sort of a dispute that they had.
*  Was it before I think it was before the Amanda No
*  no no no no no no.
*  They put out a video Cyborg's
*  boyfriend put out a video where she put
*  words in Dana White's mouth
*  and they were fake.
*  They mistranslated it on purpose
*  willfully and then she had apologized for
*  it and the UFC was like get the fuck out of here.
*  You can't do that. Yeah. And that's when they really
*  but that wasn't her right. That was her boyfriend.
*  Her boyfriend and her manager and I think her son like that
*  boyfriend is her man. Okay. Yeah.
*  That's what it was. So that's why
*  she got out of the business. That's why the UFC got done
*  with the Cyborg. But here's the
*  thing is that when she was with
*  when she she's been she would have lost in what
*  15 years or something like that. Since Gina Carano
*  before the Gina Carano fight her
*  first fight. It was the very first fight she lost.
*  Yeah. But whenever.
*  So that first fight she hadn't lost since
*  then. It's been close to 15 years.
*  And to say that like now of a sudden because she had
*  one loss after Amanda Noon
*  when she lost to Amanda Noon that she's
*  done like she wants to fight easy fight.
*  Julia Budd is not an easy fight for her.
*  You know and but that
*  we go back to when I was talking about the narrative.
*  The narrative being that Dana shapes
*  the narrative. The narrative is that look if you want to fight
*  over there you're going to have easier fights.
*  And the press jumps on board and the fighters
*  jump on board and it becomes an issue. That's why
*  I feel like we're not seeing
*  cross promotions. Well I just think it's a business
*  decision. The UFC doesn't have any vested interest
*  in blowing up Bellator and making them bigger.
*  And Bellator would get bigger along the way.
*  But I think Julia Budd hangs with any
*  145 pounder in the UFC and I would like
*  to see her fight in the UFC. I would like to see
*  cross promotion with her as well.
*  I just feel like it's just one of those things
*  where it's it hampers
*  the fans because the athletes
*  they're just not going to face each other.
*  Well let me let me go into this
*  is we already saw a cross promotion
*  when UFC was basically
*  asking or
*  I don't want to say banging but they were
*  trying to force the issue with Chuck Liddell fighting
*  in Van Der Leyen.
*  And remember that they got fucked over because
*  they actually sent Chuck over there and then
*  Pride didn't send anybody over here.
*  Yes. You know and here's the thing is we've already
*  seen with Scott what he says he's going to do
*  he does. And that's a big reason when I had
*  I actually had to fight Calagiri.
*  It was supposed to be they sent Aoki over when
*  it was Dream and they sent Aoki over
*  and Scott was supposed to send Gilbert over afterwards
*  to fight each other. So Aoki fought Gill
*  in Strikeforce and then after Gill beat him
*  he was supposed to go over there and fight him in a ring.
*  That didn't happen. So I got a call on like
*  12 days notice and Scott's like you need
*  can you do this for me. And I was like
*  I'm literally sitting at the fucking court side of the Warriors
*  game eating chicken strips and drinking a beer.
*  And I'm like I'm like let me go home and run
*  about four or five miles see how I feel and I'll get back to you
*  call him that night at midnight. And he's like I'm like yeah
*  I'm good I can go. So that's how I took the fight
*  with Calagiri on like 10 days notice.
*  And just so look when people want to talk about how
*  the Japanese do business and what
*  happened with the UFC I can understand. I can understand
*  why they're hesitant to do cross promotion
*  because when I actually accepted that fight
*  with 10 days notice I was supposed to fight Aoki
*  but when I got there they changed it to Calagiri.
*  Wow that's a big difference.
*  But what they do is what they do is one's
*  a wrestler one's a jiu jitsu guy sure.
*  But the other thing too is what they do is they
*  say hey here's another
*  amount of money. Here's a check for this.
*  If you switch and you take this guy.
*  So it's different. You know like
*  they're so sneaky over there. I don't
*  know if it's called sneaky. They just they really
*  want to. I bet Aoki now
*  is wishing he would have fought me because he got knocked out that night by
*  a kickboxer because they made him fight a kickboxer.
*  And that's what Japan is famous for.
*  They really want to they want to put fights together
*  that people don't expect to happen.
*  You know we saw hoist fight the big sumo
*  guy and you know and
*  those are fights that people talk about for they're
*  ones for the ages man. Look at when Fedor fought
*  that big hung man Choi.
*  We still to this day we still to this
*  day talk about those kind of fights you know.
*  But you know even Fedor wouldn't fight Bob Sapp
*  and his prime. He's like get the fuck out
*  of here. When Minotauro got fucking
*  pile-drive. Yep. He was like no no no.
*  No that's an injury you keep for the rest of your life.
*  Yeah. And Minotauro's neck
*  is still fucked up to this day. It doesn't make
*  any sense. Sure there's guys that you can
*  fight but Bob Sapp was one of the first guys
*  to explore on the scene that had a lot of athleticism.
*  375 with abs.
*  Yeah 375.
*  100% clean.
*  Clean as a whistle. Dude when I met him
*  like if you stand next to him you just go wait
*  wait wait wait what in the fuck are you.
*  What are you. What is this new type of human being.
*  He's so big. Have you ever talked to him.
*  Yeah I've talked to him. Yeah.
*  He can talk
*  He can talk. I was
*  on a bus ride from
*  somewhere in Tokyo to Saitama
*  arena and it was like an hour and 20 minutes.
*  He talked the whole
*  He's made an interesting career right.
*  He was an enormous
*  superstar in Japan. Enormous.
*  It's hard for us to understand like they were
*  selling dolls of him and posters
*  and he was huge.
*  But then he ran afoul with
*  K-1. Remember there was this event where
*  they didn't have a contract for him. He was supposed
*  to fight and he's like where's the contract.
*  We'll give you the contract after the fight. He's like no no no
*  I need a contract.
*  I need to know what the fuck is happening here.
*  And then he walked out and when he walked out
*  they decided they were going to ruin him. Yeah it was that night.
*  They were at the venue. He's like I'm still
*  willing to fight. Just give me the contract. They never gave him the
*  contract. He was telling me that story the whole time.
*  I was there. Is that the Yakuza?
*  What are they doing? How does that work? I would imagine
*  yeah. I get the vibe that
*  it is a little bit. You know I don't think much has changed.
*  Just to be honest. That's a power
*  move. You know to let you know no after the fight
*  we'll give you the contract. What are you talking
*  about man. No he's and he's still
*  fighting. He's still making like 60 grand
*  for a minute 20. Yeah he just
*  gets tagged with a little one. That's a
*  wrap. He swings. He swings until things
*  get weird. No he straight up told me
*  he's like no no I tell them it's 60 grand
*  and I give you a minute 20. At a minute 21
*  I'm going down.
*  It's like yo
*  bro. I straight up and that was
*  one of the conversations on the bus. That is crazy.
*  I told him at a minute 21
*  I'm going down. That is so crazy.
*  I'm going to try to get around there. I don't want to take any more damage.
*  When he got his orbital broken by Krocop
*  remember he like one of his eyes looks weird
*  now. He's got like one eye that's open really wide
*  and it's because of Krocop. Which is
*  crazy like Krocop was like 220.
*  Yeah. You know and fucking hit
*  him so hard with a straight left he fractured
*  his eye socket. Sap was literally
*  more than a hundred pounds bigger than him.
*  It was that with
*  kickboxing gloves on. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Just got to fit it in the right hole.
*  That's all it is. I think it was kickboxing.
*  I think it was kickboxing gloves. As I recall it was.
*  I don't think he took him down. I think it was a kickboxing
*  fight. Well he beat Ernesto Houst
*  twice. Yep. Which is crazy and Houst
*  had him really hurt. He dug shots
*  to the body. Fucked his legs up.
*  He couldn't put in. He switched in his stance.
*  Got dropped by leg. Kicked side of the cup one or two times.
*  Got back up. I was like that was before
*  he decided the 121 was the limit.
*  Well that was when he was 89%
*  steroids. Oh man. Like his body
*  was so big and so ridiculous.
*  It just rocked up. When he fought
*  Minotauro I remember Eddie Bravo and I were
*  watching it and he they were like
*  they showed Minotauro ready
*  and they turned to Bob Sap. You're like Jesus.
*  His head was here and then his
*  neck started right where his
*  head crests. Like his neck
*  went all the way to the edge of his shoulders. Like that
*  is the biggest human being I've ever seen in my life.
*  It goes like just from his ear to his
*  shoulders. It's just so big.
*  His fucking shoulders were cartoonish.
*  It was like the big boss in a Mike Tyson
*  punch out video game.
*  He was so big and when he picked up
*  Minotauro and pile-dived him was like
*  oh my God he's going to kill him. He could kill him.
*  We're all thinking like
*  you're not allowed to do that. And they're like in Japan they're like
*  yeah fuck yeah die.
*  Stomps, head kicks. They don't give a fuck.
*  Have you ever been there to call fight?
*  Have the crowds changed?
*  Do the crowds change for the UFC? A little bit.
*  A little more cheery but they're still
*  very quiet.
*  In between transitions you hear everything.
*  It's weird because you hear the coaches.
*  Left leg, left leg, get through, pass through, pass through.
*  You hear like the
*  fighter can hear it, the opponent can hear it.
*  It's very strange. Never been to our gym because it's not
*  quiet at all. When we're training
*  at Spahn guys are like coaching each other.
*  Fuck that guy. Get up, get up. Don't let him fucking
*  take you down. They're getting on each other.
*  But over there it's so funny.
*  My first fight over there in Pride they
*  switched my opponent like six times. I showed up
*  and then finally the original guy I was supposed to fight
*  was a miraculously healthy and ready to fight again.
*  He just shows up to the lands just jacked
*  and shit. Oh god.
*  So I ended up fighting him. Who was it?
*  I want to say his name was Dasuke
*  Sugie. They call him the Amazon.
*  Real good Jiu Jitsu guy. Phenomenal Jiu Jitsu guy.
*  And he swung for an
*  armbar on me like in a minute. I fucking almost
*  got it. I was like belly down trying to escape.
*  Had that fight been in any other organization
*  I probably would have lost. Because I could
*  hear Crazy Bob and Dave Camerulo
*  yelling to me, hey push the feet off the face
*  because my arm was fully extended. He was belly
*  down. I was belly down. And I'm like
*  and it was I could hear my elbow just going
*  and I could just feel
*  the muscle kind of stretching and tearing
*  a little bit. And then I just started pushing
*  and I could hear them crystal clear.
*  Get the feet off your face. Get the feet
*  off your face. Dave Camerulo was like
*  in such like can't believe this happened. He almost started walking
*  back to the fucking back to the locker room
*  thinking that I was going to tap because I was trying
*  to reach for the feet. And he's yelling
*  put the foot put the get the feet off your face
*  so I was able to push and wiggle it out. And when I wiggled
*  it out I swung around for the e-bar
*  in the perfect position. I was able to get the knee bar and the fight ended
*  like that. It was like a minute 20 minute 30
*  something like that. So but it was one of those
*  you know one of those things that
*  they do in Japan where the cultures
*  are so different over there. It's really quiet.
*  Everyone would pass the guard. Everyone would cheer.
*  Yeah. I'm like wow
*  this is kind of cool. But it's kind of is a little
*  weird when you're you know you guys are
*  squared up and you're bouncing around. You can
*  hear it from the canvas
*  the floorboards. You're all all right. This is
*  it's a little it's a little
*  distracting. Yeah. You're like I'd rather hear the crowd.
*  It's funny. I wonder if you get used to
*  that. And then if you go to fight in the UFC it must be
*  overwhelming for Japanese guys that
*  are used to fighting over there with that total quiet
*  and they come to Vegas. It's like just bleed
*  guys with the fucking on the
*  shirt.
*  And then like as they're walking out you're gonna die
*  you know this. It's crazy.
*  It's crazy over there. What a wild fucking sport.
*  It's so it's such a crazy sport
*  when you just think about the evolution of it. I mean
*  you you started your career.
*  You mean you really are a pioneer but you
*  started your career like you're like a second wave
*  guy. You're like there was the first wave
*  where no one knew what the fuck was going on. And then
*  there was a second wave where guys were like complete
*  martial artists that had a specialty background.
*  Yours being initially wrestling. Yeah. And then you
*  see the third wave guys
*  the guys have been like essentially training mixed
*  martial arts since they were children. You know and that's
*  like what we're seeing now. Yeah.
*  And Max Holloway as well and some of these other guys.
*  And when when you see
*  it now and you compare it to like
*  what the UFC was when you first started watching
*  first started competing it's gotta
*  blow you away. Yeah
*  you know what it does.
*  It blows me away because look I was actually
*  fortunate enough before
*  I started training with Frank Shamrock
*  and he was kind of like that first guy.
*  He was first wave. Yeah. I mean like
*  Marco Huas was kind of the first wave guy.
*  I would say he was probably the first
*  but the first I felt like the first guy
*  with the big notoriety the guy was Frank Shamrock
*  the guy that kind of like boosted up to there.
*  And he
*  was decent on the on the feet.
*  Great. Good submissions.
*  You know but great. He elevated the cardio
*  that he became. He was like that first guy that's
*  you need to be in tip top shape.
*  There's no more barstool guys winning these fights
*  anymore. And he made sure that was clear. Him
*  and Tito were kind of like you're not just going to get off a
*  barstool and come in here and fucking beat me. Well he changed
*  Tito's whole game. Yes.
*  Well not just in that game after I don't know if you know
*  but after he lost to Frank he went up and trained with
*  Frank so Frank could teach him how
*  to get in shape and be like he'd be as in good
*  as shape as he as Frank was for their fight.
*  So moving forward Tito Frank
*  was always thinking about himself at that time.
*  I don't know if much has changed but he basically just
*  said like hey I
*  want to make sure you're not beat for a long time because it
*  continues to make me look good.
*  So he made sure that Tito understood how conditioning
*  worked and he just trained him in his regiment and how
*  these things and that's the story that Frank learned
*  from. He learned from Javier Mendez and Marie
*  Smith. OK.
*  You know Maurice. Yeah.
*  Maurice always had phenomenal cardio and Maurice
*  also trained Bob Sapp to.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  That's such an interesting
*  time where things shifted
*  and guys started to figure out the overall
*  puzzle of mixed martial arts.
*  In that sense Frank Shamrock really was
*  like one of the first really complete guys.
*  Remember when he arm barred Kevin Jackson.
*  Yep. The first round in the UFC Japan.
*  And I can tell you yeah in that in that conversation
*  with he had with Javier Mendez like man
*  Javier goes this guy's really tough.
*  You got to do this. You got to do that.
*  He's like he's like he's going to take me down and he takes me down
*  and I'm going to arm bar him. Sure as shit.
*  Same thing. He's like you know they always put their hands up.
*  They always do this. They always do that.
*  Frank just had this knack at that time.
*  He was so driven and whatever it was
*  that he was doing it didn't matter.
*  I kid you not. There was moments where I was training
*  with him and was to the point where he didn't care.
*  He literally rolled over threw up on the mat
*  went back to training like it never happened.
*  OK guys let's scoot away from it a little bit.
*  Just kept rolling like there was never
*  away from the throw from the throw up.
*  No he didn't clean it up. Waited till the round was waited
*  till the round was done. We all scooted all over
*  trained some more came back over and he wiped it
*  off the mat. Boy that's distracting.
*  It's distracting.
*  It's distracting. But at the time it was the focus
*  of like hey I'm not done with my round.
*  Let me finish getting this in. I'm out of shape.
*  Sure. But you know I'm not going to get in shape if
*  I keep quitting to stop and do this and pick this up
*  along the way. Right. You know I'm
*  I don't know. I think this I like seeing how the
*  sports evolved. I like.
*  I feel like
*  we have I think
*  in combat sports from 170
*  down were phenomenal.
*  From one eighty five to like two
*  or five even like the talent needs
*  to be questioned a little bit. Sure there's talented guys.
*  Don't get me wrong. But I think the best athletes
*  in our sport are from one seventy down.
*  And just because they seem to be
*  the most well I mean look John Jones is an anomaly.
*  He's one of those guys just like like
*  he is look at his brothers.
*  I mean like phenomenal athletes. He's a phenomenal
*  athlete. Fantastic gene pool. Yeah.
*  Right. Yeah right. Three
*  world class athletes in the family.
*  Insane. Yeah. You know.
*  So you have guys like him you know and you
*  have other guys that don't look the part but are the part.
*  Gagar Musasi. Same thing. You don't look the part.
*  You see him you're like you know Fado or Milan
*  Aiko. Yeah. Yeah. But guess what.
*  Fucking world. You surprise the rampage right.
*  Ah no not at all.
*  No he's still got crazy hand speed.
*  It's that's that's the one thing that Frank Mir when I talk to him
*  after he's like I thought I could hit him is I did
*  graze him a little bit. I thought I rocked him he's like and then he
*  just he knocked him out going backwards. Yeah.
*  You know the power still there.
*  Last thing to go. We all know that the speed is still
*  there. That's what's crazy is the speed.
*  He's not as durable as he used to be. No not at all.
*  But you can't be. You know I mean what is he forty
*  two forty three years old. I mean it.
*  But the thing is is it's still no matter what.
*  He's fun to watch fight.
*  Oh yeah man. I enjoyed the rampage fight.
*  I just thought rampage first of all sad
*  when I saw rampage was so heavy. Yeah.
*  And I was like there's no way he could have trained really hard.
*  It doesn't help you to be that fat.
*  Well he was training with TJ
*  Dillsall's guy.
*  The guy out of the training lab. Yeah.
*  I mean there was a lot of pictures.
*  Yeah. Sal Calivita was that pictures of him
*  doing the bike in his garage.
*  And I mean I don't know if it was just a photo op but
*  maybe only did a couple of times.
*  I don't know. But look there's there's a ton of guys
*  in you know in our in Bellator
*  and the guys I would love to see.
*  It doesn't have to be for title fights because we were talking
*  about cross promotion. It doesn't got to be title fights.
*  Let's not let's not ruin champions.
*  Let's put together fights that if we did
*  think about think about this.
*  A year end show every year
*  where we pick you know you kind of let the fans
*  pick or you know you have you let's say you have a board.
*  So you have a board of people that
*  year end show we do and we say hey
*  we'd like to see this guy fight this guy.
*  I would love to see Volkonovsky
*  and Patricio.
*  I would love to see Lima versus
*  Usman but that they're both champions.
*  So let's have somebody else fight.
*  Let's see Stephen Thompson MVP.
*  Yes. Let's have this conversation.
*  Look it doesn't need to be champions.
*  There's no there's nothing to lose or risk other than
*  the fans getting to see the best fights that
*  fans want to see.
*  That's the one thing I've always given credit to Coker
*  about is like let's see these fights happen.
*  The problem is I think the UFC feels like it would benefit
*  Bellator but it wouldn't benefit the UFC
*  because the UFC can make many fights
*  for Wonder Boy.
*  Let me let me just make an argument to that.
*  There's the one fight with Conor McGregor
*  and Mayweather this like other guys.
*  I don't know if you ever heard of him his cut fling Mayweather.
*  OK so there's these two guys.
*  They got together for one fight.
*  Right. And that fight did what numbers.
*  Crazy numbers but astronomical numbers.
*  But that was a freak show right because you got a guy
*  Floyd Mayweather is the greatest boxer of all time.
*  Right. Undefeated 49 and 0 going into that fight.
*  It's a crazy situation.
*  Yeah. And Conor's never fought in boxing ever.
*  Zero professional boxing fights against the greatest
*  fighter ever.
*  And you make this gigantic promotion
*  where it's not really going to hurt Conor because it's not
*  really his sport.
*  I mean it's a different animal.
*  Joe.
*  Joe the biggest pay per view right now for MMA is what
*  Khabib and Conor.
*  Correct. 2.4 million.
*  Yeah that would be that will like the original
*  the fight to make that would probably be the biggest
*  rematch as well.
*  OK so that but I don't know how much it would be the biggest
*  rematch only because he Conor lost and he lost pretty
*  convincingly.
*  Yeah but after smashing cowboy like that I bet you could
*  sell it.
*  Oh no I'm not saying you couldn't sell it.
*  I'm just simply saying I may not do 2.4.
*  It may do that or it may do a little bit less.
*  People have already seen it.
*  They've already seen it wasn't close.
*  So they may not buy it.
*  They now if Conor was to go and fight somebody else
*  and have a dominant performance against someone like a Justin
*  Gagey and get him out of there or whatever or against
*  Usman.
*  Yes. Then you make that fight and do more numbers
*  but not off of the 40 seconds we just saw.
*  Maybe.
*  You know and I'm not I'm not trying to toe what what
*  Stephen A is saying but we didn't see enough
*  to believe that people could say that he fight.
*  We saw domination.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's not enough to say that he could stop Khabib's
*  wrestling.
*  That's the only concern people are going to talk about.
*  Yes.
*  You know but what I what I was trying to get at
*  was the conversation with pay per views is
*  you do a year end fighter once a year fighter.
*  Let's just say one little say one else say once a year.
*  It's easy to and you take the fights
*  that fans want to see or you have a board member
*  of groups from each promotion and say look
*  let's put this fight in this fight together not our champions.
*  And I'll bet you that that one card does
*  double or triple what the best pay per view ever
*  has done.
*  I don't think so.
*  I think so.
*  If you say you say that much I think you
*  care. I think you care
*  and I care.
*  I don't think people care that much.
*  You don't think so.
*  I think the buzz in and I also think
*  the marketing dollars behind each promotion
*  to help push it.
*  They'll make it bigger than Connor
*  and could be than anything.
*  I don't think you can.
*  I don't think you can make it bigger.
*  It what makes a fight bigger
*  is someone who already has a cult of personality
*  behind them right.
*  Khabib already has this insane
*  following
*  first of all the Muslim world's behind
*  the first Muslim fighters ever
*  to win a world title.
*  He's also just this phenomenal
*  freak athlete who fucking mauls everybody
*  and you know this unstoppable force against
*  this irresistible object.
*  And then Connor is this incredible enigmatic
*  person who's just so charismatic
*  and everybody wants to see him fight
*  and he's got lightning in his left hand.
*  He's got a history of starching people like
*  Jose Aldo
*  and Chad Mendoz.
*  And you look at it you like what is going to happen
*  when these two fight
*  but you don't have that.
*  You look I want to see like
*  I say guys like Douglas Lima
*  but how much does the general public the casual
*  fan want to see that.
*  I don't think there's that much of a following.
*  I mean how many what is Douglas Lima's
*  Instagram.
*  How many followers does he have on his Instagram.
*  You look at Khabib and Connor.
*  Yeah.
*  Connor's like 50 million or something.
*  Khabib's got something similar.
*  Okay. So my take is like is this
*  is you take someone like Islam Makacheff
*  who trains with Khabib on nonstop.
*  He's a fucking savage.
*  And I've seen the two of them go out 160
*  thousand hundred for one of the best
*  fighters on the planet.
*  Yeah.
*  So you take a guy like you better click that
*  follow bitch.
*  I'm not following that follow.
*  Give him 161.
*  So if you if you
*  if you match guys if you match guys
*  like you say Islam versus Chandler
*  if you match guys like you know
*  these other you match some of the gay guard
*  because there was a lot of talk is gay guard was winning
*  when he left the UFC came over to Bellator.
*  Chris Wideman when Chris was on top of his game.
*  So you take guys like gay guard you match
*  him against you know somebody over in the UFC
*  and you're and you're taking these these top
*  guys MVP and Stephen Thompson.
*  I think a stacked card like
*  that be given the given
*  the results from when we're talking about
*  Japan when they do their year end show is the number
*  two in all of Japan
*  for that for their TV viewerships.
*  It's just some astronomical amount of numbers.
*  I wouldn't imagine I would imagine it be
*  bigger than what Connor and Khabib did.
*  I still don't think so.
*  I don't even think you would.
*  I think it would be I think it would.
*  I'm glad you're not a promoter.
*  Now there's a lot of money.
*  Well here's the thing though is you're you're not taking
*  consideration if we use Mighty Mouse
*  we use Eddie Alvarez we use the guy Timothy
*  Nass you can there's there's marketing dollars
*  behind one there's marketing dollars behind Bellator
*  there's no matter you can't make someone famous.
*  No but you can also but you hit all those different
*  markets they are going to promote once a person
*  is famous.
*  Yes you can promote it make it a giant thing
*  when they're not famous to make them famous for
*  a promotion to make the promotion larger.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  The biggest fucking pay-per-view they could ever
*  do with Mighty Mouse was inadequate.
*  No one cared.
*  Yeah for whatever reason a casual fan didn't care
*  Timothy Nasty you can they're going to carry
*  way less.
*  Yeah way less.
*  I'm throwing out names that we're talking about so people
*  understand.
*  But yeah.
*  Look like I mean it's just one
*  of those things for the hardcore fan if everyone
*  was like you or I.
*  Yeah it would be 100 percent of the world would by the
*  ticket.
*  I mean it would be something that everybody would want
*  to buy the pay-per-view but just I don't care
*  that much about how successful
*  would be.
*  What I care about would it be good for the sport
*  and what people like you or I who are hardcore
*  fans would we want to see that the answers
*  yes 100 percent.
*  I mean I do want to see Pitbull versus
*  Volkanovsky or versus Max Holloway.
*  I you know I do want to see Lima
*  versus Kamaru Usman.
*  I do want to see these kind of these kind of fights
*  but in the UFC's position like man
*  170 so goddamn crazy as it is.
*  Yeah.
*  What do you do with Masvidal.
*  What do you do with Connor now.
*  Right. What do you do with Kobe when he comes back
*  from his jaw healing up.
*  I mean do they do they set up a rematch for that
*  fight because that was a phenomenal fight between
*  him and Usman.
*  Yeah.
*  And boy did that fucking get everybody hyped
*  up and paid attention.
*  There's so many big fights as it is.
*  Tyron Woodley.
*  He's going to fight Leon Edwards.
*  That to me is the fight man.
*  That's a dangerous fight for both guys.
*  T-Woods my boy.
*  Leon is he's phenomenal.
*  I've had it with him.
*  I've trade with wood.
*  They're both extremely fast.
*  Both very good.
*  And then now the evolution of Leon Edwards is
*  grappling mixed with his wrestling.
*  What he did to Gunnar Nelson was just nasty.
*  I was like oh wow oh wow.
*  We just decided to up our game all of a sudden.
*  Yes.
*  Very impressive.
*  He's a dark horse in that division.
*  You know he's he's one of the people are not
*  paying attention to Dutch and you know speaking
*  in dark horses you got Calvin Cater
*  at 145.
*  He's the fucking dark horse at 145.
*  He was putting on the beat in that third round.
*  I was like holy shit man.
*  If this is a fourth and fifth round he might
*  stop him.
*  He's that fucking good.
*  You have guys like Zabito that I for me
*  I feel like they're doing they do well they do
*  well they're doing good.
*  They almost sort of fall in.
*  They almost start to believe the hype a little bit.
*  And feel like he took some time like
*  maybe just not didn't go back to folks
*  in training hard.
*  I've done that a couple of times in my career.
*  Like I'm going to walk through this guy.
*  Not a big deal because you don't know about
*  that person.
*  But after Cater starts llamas how the fuck
*  do you think that he put llamas
*  lights out.
*  Yeah you can also say though that like
*  llamas wasn't what he was
*  when he was making his title run.
*  You know what I mean.
*  So maybe but he was still doing really well.
*  You know I think it's just
*  a it's a case of massive
*  amounts of talent in that division.
*  And like trying to figure out who goes where
*  and what goes where.
*  Yeah you know and I mean
*  you can say that about 35 as well.
*  Like 35 is a crazy talent stacked place
*  too.
*  Yeah I mean like you're like so it's 40 go back
*  to go back to 45.
*  We got this kid named Adam Borich.
*  Dude Borich is a monster.
*  So flying these he knocked Pico
*  out with and he's one of Henry Hoof's guys.
*  He did it. He did it again before that.
*  So he's got two flying knockouts in Bellator
*  and all the buzz around Henry
*  Hoof's place is that some of the 55
*  pounders don't want to spar with him and train with him because he's fucking
*  good. He's fucking good.
*  He's long he's lanky and he's extremely good.
*  I've seen videos of him training
*  and I've seen videos of him fighting and I want
*  to see him fight live.
*  I haven't seen him fight live yet but this weekend.
*  But how old is he.
*  He's like 24.
*  He's 20.
*  I think he's 26.
*  I think he's 26.
*  Yeah.
*  So he's you know entering
*  his prime.
*  Yeah for sure.
*  I feel like the prime is 26 to 32.
*  Like that's your 31 32 somewhere
*  in there. Like when I was training
*  and I felt like I was unstoppable was
*  that 27 to 32 age 26
*  26.
*  The fucking.
*  That's my job though.
*  Good job.
*  Look there's one fighter.
*  He's phenomenal.
*  Also two people.
*  The guy that's fighting Patricio
*  Pedro Cavallo who fight who trains at SBG
*  with the Cardinals.
*  He's someone's fucking really good
*  as well.
*  Yes.
*  I just look at these guys
*  and Adam Weishel like
*  or Daniel Weishel.
*  He's another guy that's like he's such a technician
*  just doesn't doesn't fight the part
*  because people want to see high flying
*  flying knee knockouts like Adam Borch
*  does but he's super
*  technical really good.
*  The 45 pound division is stacked
*  and then who was your heavyweight champion now.
*  Bader.
*  Oh that's right.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a dual champ.
*  Yeah.
*  So he's 25.
*  And he's.
*  Why I felt for some reason I felt like
*  he relinquished one of the titles
*  but no that's not the case.
*  No he's.
*  Yeah he stopped.
*  Fader I was like holy shit.
*  Quick man.
*  He's one of those guys that actually looks better
*  and heavyweight.
*  He needs to stay there.
*  I don't know why he's supposed to be fighting coming up.
*  We haven't announced a fight yet I don't believe.
*  He's fighting.
*  Coming up.
*  And so I wish he would.
*  He's fighting 205.
*  He weighs like 240.
*  Walk around.
*  Yeah walk around.
*  Why why would you go down.
*  Yeah.
*  You're I said you not only do you
*  you're faster you're better wrestler than all these guys.
*  And.
*  Look I got a lot of respect for Steve Bay and him
*  and Steve Bay are friends but I think wrestling
*  wise and fight wise he has a good chance
*  to beat Steve Bay.
*  Only because of his ability with his wrestling
*  his cardio
*  and his pace the speed
*  and everything I think he get in on him.
*  Well his striking got so much better
*  and so smooth.
*  And you know he just got better in the pocket
*  you know after like particularly the leota
*  machita loss that was a.
*  You know a big thing because he came
*  came charging in machita caught him in
*  and clipped him with a counter shot and put him away.
*  You know there was there were some moments
*  where you like man maybe Bader his time
*  has passed and then also he has this
*  resurgence and starts doing better
*  and better and then goes on to become
*  in Bellator like a fucking
*  demon. Well you got to remember that fighting
*  is a confidence thing as you win one
*  fight you win another and you win another
*  right there.
*  It becomes getting lean defending
*  the 205 pound light heavyweight title in April.
*  Yeah I'm trying to.
*  I want to see I don't know what the name
*  what the he's fighting
*  and if we announce
*  it yet though.
*  Who was who was there for who is he looking
*  for. I didn't see one.
*  Yeah I don't know for him
*  at heavyweight.
*  So you've got a Congo
*  yeah you got check.
*  I don't know if him and they're not going to do the
*  rematch with that because I remember there was like a weird
*  I poke slash like nose
*  and right thumb in the nose kind of weird thing.
*  So check got out
*  and I don't know what the deal was so
*  you got Minkoff Minkoff was the former
*  champion who was there before
*  and
*  we had the flu.
*  I want to say he lost to check Congo
*  because he had the flu when he fought.
*  So then but then he's he's someone that right
*  now is I mean he's fun.
*  He was his only loss.
*  Then he that's what got checked the
*  title shot.
*  So the two of them Minkoff is someone that scares
*  me with Bader because size wise he's bigger
*  than Bader. He's fast.
*  He's got that kind of like Sombol background
*  and he's good.
*  This doesn't seem like it
*  seems like it's really hard to get top talent
*  and heavyweight top talent and heavyweight.
*  There's always been the UFC at least it's always
*  been the most shallow pool.
*  Yeah I feel that way in one eight five if you look
*  at like even boxing one eight five is one of
*  the most gutted weight classes there are
*  occasionally you get the two or five guys.
*  I mean like I said John Jones you know
*  is an anomaly.
*  You get those kind of guys that come in
*  but I also think that now that the money's gotten
*  better you're going to see start seeing athletes
*  that would have went to football and baseball
*  and basketball.
*  They're going to stop doing that and saying hey
*  these guys are making this much money.
*  Let me try and go over there.
*  Now when they're seeing million dollar paydays
*  and organizations like the PFL you're
*  like fuck I can make a million dollars like shit
*  and you know and not
*  it's it's just I think you're going to start seeing
*  some of those athletes that may be a bench
*  warmer in the NFL or maybe a bench warmer
*  and in baseball or like having to go through
*  the D League process or like man
*  fuck this I'm going to make money over there.
*  Look at Greg Hardy.
*  You know coming over and you
*  know and having good performances and such
*  a long road though man it is just getting
*  into fighting and then trying to go
*  professional with skills that you've acquired
*  from football
*  and basketball.
*  They're not mean you're an athlete you're a great athlete
*  and fast and strong but boy there's
*  so many variables that come into play when you're
*  fighting.
*  Yeah but you also have covered.
*  You got to look at it though as well as if you
*  go to the if you go to an organization like the UFC
*  has done Greg Hardy some favors.
*  You know they haven't given them right.
*  Top top guys you know and so
*  when that happens because he has a name
*  and they're going to be groomed then why not.
*  Well they gave him a tough fight in Volkoff.
*  Yes they did.
*  That was a tough fight.
*  Yes it was.
*  I was really impressed with him in that fight because
*  Volkoff used to be belt or champion
*  top of the food chain heavyweight big long
*  tall guy difficult to fuck with.
*  You know it's like he's he knocked out Fabricio
*  Verduin former heavyweight champion.
*  So like Volkoff is very
*  skillful.
*  Yeah.
*  Awkward as hell man so tall and long.
*  Yeah he's it's one of those stars like you have
*  to learn to get past the push kick and the long jab
*  and all those things and once you do you walk right into
*  the knees.
*  Dude that Derek Lewis KO was so
*  bananas when Derek Lewis knocked him out
*  like that is crazy.
*  And then afterwards he took his shorts off.
*  Good.
*  My balls are hot.
*  Oh shit.
*  Derek Lewis is a national treasure.
*  He is a national treasure and he has the best fucking
*  Instagram in the game.
*  Fucking it's so funny after
*  that happened I went to his Instagram the next morning
*  and jumped up like almost a million
*  followers like I was like Joe out here
*  making everyone famous.
*  Jesus.
*  But it was it was he but it's funny I
*  was following him before that
*  and I loved all the things he
*  posted. So good he's so hilarious
*  he's a lawyer and anytime something fucked
*  up goes down in the world there's a video of it.
*  Yeah it's on Derek Lewis.
*  Is it.
*  I think I think he I don't
*  know if he put there was something he posted
*  the other day it was fucking hilarious.
*  He's a man.
*  He's awesome man.
*  A man I always love at the end with someone
*  like false four stories lands on their head
*  and his first quote is they're okay
*  though. Yeah he's okay.
*  He's okay.
*  He's okay.
*  I'm thinking to myself the guy
*  is fucking dead.
*  Oh so they're going to do Francis
*  and Gano and Rosenstrike.
*  That is a crazy.
*  Yeah that is I don't
*  I wasn't impressed with Rosenstrike though.
*  I mean he's got big power.
*  He's got the power.
*  Well I was impressed with his durability
*  against Alistair and his patience
*  and the fact that he landed that haymaker right
*  hook with like what 15 seconds ago
*  or something.
*  Oh my god that was one of the worst cuts
*  I've ever seen in all my years.
*  Yeah people try to relate that shit to Lawler's
*  cut and I was like Lawler's cut was like he
*  had a sliver to what that
*  was. His face exploded.
*  That was nasty.
*  The fact that that happened with one punch like
*  that is bananas.
*  Yeah and what was crazy about it was
*  that it actually happened where his mouthpiece was
*  and that for that type of power to land
*  and split your mouth like that your mouthpiece is supposed
*  to stop those.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah and it didn't.
*  So that was gross.
*  It was nasty.
*  It was crazy.
*  I felt bad for him to be honest.
*  I was just surprised how he was walking through
*  everything Alistair was hitting with.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean Alistair is a fucking killer.
*  Outside of the cut I have no
*  sympathy for him. He's married to like a model.
*  I don't think I give a shit.
*  Like really dude you're married to a model.
*  Like whatever dude.
*  The cut healed up so fast.
*  Did you see how quickly it healed.
*  Yeah yeah and there was like no swelling either.
*  I'm like what are you made out of.
*  Yeah.
*  Well also you got to look at that guy like he's
*  been knocked out like 30 times
*  or something crazy like how is he.
*  And you hear him talk he sounds perfect.
*  It's nuts probably because he's in love
*  with a bottle.
*  His model girlfriend.
*  I don't know man.
*  I don't know either.
*  It's crazy.
*  He's he cracks me up though because I'm
*  oh there's some things I can't say with him
*  though.
*  He's a he's a good guy.
*  Was over in Japan a couple of times when we
*  had fought and he was there on the same card
*  and he was jacked
*  at that time.
*  Dude.
*  Jacked.
*  Back when he fought Todd Duffy.
*  Yeah.
*  Those days.
*  Yes I was on that car.
*  Holy shit.
*  Yeah I was on that car.
*  The Brock Lesnar fights the perfect example.
*  That's Oubre that is finest when
*  he fought Brock Lesnar.
*  So he got cut.
*  I mean that's crazy.
*  That's like a couple of weeks later.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah I mean it's all fucked
*  up for a couple of days.
*  You got to imagine he probably got a little bit
*  of plastic surgery done to it as well for them
*  because I mean skin graft.
*  What do they do.
*  I don't think they skin grafted.
*  I think they just stitched the fucking shit out
*  of it. They stitch it inside.
*  Yeah stitch it outside.
*  And if you look at that that's going to heal
*  real good man.
*  I mean that's that's still pretty fresh.
*  I had a very similar one.
*  I was wrestling at AK and I take a
*  double. I double did this guy and he
*  hit the ground first and when his head bounced
*  up and hit me in the mouth I wasn't wearing a mouthpiece.
*  So my tooth my tooth came
*  all the way through the front of my lip.
*  And it didn't look that bad but it looked
*  nasty.
*  It was nasty.
*  Something about your mouth heals quick too.
*  Yeah weird.
*  Yeah I would imagine to defend off
*  and against infections.
*  Yeah.
*  Just you know what I mean.
*  You got to wonder how many more
*  fights a guy like Alistair can endure.
*  I mean how many times can that guy get stopped.
*  You look at all the times he got stopped in Pride
*  and K1 and then the UFC.
*  I mean he's had some of the fucking
*  just the Inganu one.
*  That left hook Inganu hit him with.
*  The back of his head hit his spine.
*  That was nasty.
*  The back of it.
*  It was so.
*  It blew back.
*  I thought he died.
*  I was like this guy's gone.
*  Rosenstrike and Inganu is going
*  to be a very fascinating fight because
*  Rosenstrike is a you know he's a real
*  high level kickboxer.
*  He's an excellent Muay Thai.
*  His leg kicks.
*  And I'm wondering if we're going to see more of that in the Inganu
*  fight since Inganu was so boxing heavy
*  and power heavy.
*  But Inganu the difference is Inganu
*  hits you once.
*  Yeah.
*  He hits guys once and just changes your whole life.
*  I think I think guys are going to.
*  I'm surprised we haven't seen
*  more guys go to the well
*  with the calf kick.
*  Like in the heavyweight division I haven't seen it a whole lot.
*  But Junior was hitting Inganu with it a couple of times
*  early in their fight.
*  I feel like I feel like Junior
*  though is a guy that he needs to evolve
*  because he has the miles on him.
*  I mean he hasn't been the same guy since Kane.
*  Since that Kane fight.
*  He's been good at moments
*  but he's also been bad you know.
*  The second fight with Kane then the third
*  fight with Kane really did him in.
*  Yeah.
*  So he just hasn't been the same but he's
*  evolving I think with the smaller
*  guys are doing to exploit the heavier guys that just
*  don't move as much.
*  And I think I feel like
*  that calf kick has changed the game.
*  The very first time I ever saw that thing being used
*  was Mazvodal.
*  And Mazvodal used that against Gilbert Melendez.
*  He put I'm sure he used it before that.
*  But he swept Gill off his feet probably three
*  or four times in that fight.
*  And I was thinking to myself wow there's something to this.
*  Well Benson Henderson was the first guy I ever
*  saw do it.
*  Got it.
*  Benson was throwing a lot of those back in the day too.
*  Heavy kicks.
*  Yeah but it's really interesting how much more
*  effective it is now.
*  Like you're seeing guys take one or two shots
*  the lower calf and then their legs starting to give out.
*  And it shuts your nerves down which
*  is what's so weird about it.
*  Yeah because that happened to Chandler when he fought
*  on premise.
*  So Brent.
*  Yeah.
*  So and everyone was like oh it's
*  nothing they'll be all right.
*  I'm like no no like your foot doesn't move anymore.
*  How about Sahudo when he fought Mighty Mouse
*  in the second fight.
*  I was surprised he was able to get it back though.
*  That's what was nice about that was he was able
*  to get it back.
*  I mean had he had I think
*  Mighty Mouse went to it a couple more times it maybe
*  would have had a different effect on it.
*  It could have been the end of the fight.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a it's crazy that
*  these moments happen where something
*  changes in the sport and everybody goes oh
*  let's do that.
*  And then a lot of people start doing it like when
*  Anderson knocked out Vito with that front kick to the face.
*  Yes.
*  And everybody's like oh yeah you can throw that shit
*  to the face.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you saw a lot of it.
*  So a lot of guys went that way.
*  Which is funny because when you
*  when you take MMA
*  and you and people need to remember
*  what it stands for
*  and people for the longest time like oh let's just
*  wrestle and let's do Muay Thai.
*  And it was you know like oh OK well
*  do a little bit of boxing and you know and some wrestling.
*  They never went outside that box
*  and then guys like Stephen Thompson
*  and Machita came in.
*  You know now you see MVP
*  but when you see these guys they're bringing in a different
*  dynamic that works for them.
*  Now granted they've been doing it their whole life.
*  So you're not going to be able to adapt everything
*  that they do.
*  You can still a couple little things
*  from them.
*  You know I don't know if you recall but I was
*  like the first guy that did that little
*  I used to use my heel to your thigh
*  in the clinch against the fence.
*  I did it to Eves Edwards.
*  And he's like you're such an asshole.
*  I couldn't walk for a week.
*  You know because I would just healing him.
*  Boom boom boom.
*  And that fight was only in the first round.
*  You know and so you have things like that
*  and then BJ Penn said with Matt Sarah Matt Sarah
*  kept punching him right in the hip bone.
*  He's like and I kid you not.
*  Matt and BJ is like for almost two weeks
*  I couldn't walk.
*  I had to like limp because he had fucked up my hip.
*  Wow.
*  So little things make a big difference.
*  I wonder you know when they got rid of that
*  from the guard remember those kicks to the
*  to the kidneys to the kidneys.
*  They got rid of those.
*  I don't know if they're back now or not.
*  I don't know why they got rid of those.
*  Why is it OK to kick you in the head.
*  It's not OK to kick your kidney.
*  No idea.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  Yeah but isn't it also interesting that like
*  the back of the head like the back of the
*  head is illegal but when you
*  roundhouse kick a guy in the head a lot
*  of times you're hitting your foot wraps around
*  the back of the head but it's not illegal.
*  Well explain this one to me.
*  Right.
*  Yeah the down elbow is the dumbest thing ever.
*  The only reason why John Jones has a loss.
*  Yeah it's just one of those things you're just
*  thinking to yourself this is so stupid.
*  John explained it on the podcast.
*  Yes.
*  Does the fucking commissioners thought that that's
*  how you break bricks and you can't do that to a person.
*  Yep. And he basically just said like and then I guess
*  Lorenzo it said you know
*  John he wanted to fight for it and John goes
*  look let's just leave that alone as long
*  as we can still do it from the guard.
*  We can still do it from any other angle.
*  If it has a little bit of an angle this way and a little bit
*  of that. That's what's great.
*  Like when I do my when I do my podcast with
*  with Big John McCarthy there's things that I
*  don't know.
*  Like people don't realize fighters don't
*  know a lot about the rules.
*  We think we do.
*  Right.
*  But let me just tell you I don't like to
*  admit because John you know I like to meet John's
*  right a lot.
*  You know like there's a lot of things I don't
*  know about the actual
*  rules and I fought for years man.
*  Joe I was fighting for almost 22
*  or 23 years.
*  Also the rules of morphed a little bit.
*  Yes.
*  What do you think about the new unified rules like the
*  differences between downed opponent now
*  and things you can do that you couldn't do before.
*  But it's not but then are they really finally
*  unified.
*  They got it.
*  Nevada only except they have a modified
*  version of it.
*  Nevada says you're still a downed opponent if you have
*  one hand down.
*  See for me I feel like look for me I've
*  always thought that
*  you should be able to knee the head when you're on the
*  ground.
*  Yeah.
*  Like if I stuff your take down I should be able to knee your head
*  right there on all fours.
*  Right. Doesn't matter.
*  Especially if you're not against the cage.
*  No.
*  Against the cage is the only argument against it
*  because the guy can't move he's stuck.
*  That's the only thing that I see.
*  You're OK.
*  I agree but then get out of there.
*  Yeah. Get out of there.
*  You got to move. It's just going to create more action
*  more excitement to the fight.
*  That's the one thing that I liked about Strikeforce
*  when we were fighting for Strikeforce was that
*  we didn't allow elbows on the ground
*  and people like them.
*  I the reason I didn't like him is it just
*  at the time it's Sean Shirk was the champ
*  and it was like there wasn't a lot of movement.
*  It was like here and he was so small.
*  It's like bam bam.
*  Cut guys in the fight was stopped
*  or it was just got all bloody.
*  And for the actual fan at home
*  watching the fight not all fans
*  like to watch blood.
*  Right. You know and so it's like I want to see
*  a good fight.
*  I want to see guys get starched
*  and knocked out.
*  Right. But I want to see a good fight.
*  And so I felt like with when they
*  when Strikeforce didn't have elbows
*  you posture up.
*  It creates more space creates more space
*  less just to guy do his moves
*  as well as try to get back to the feet
*  you know or I can back out
*  and try to go big ground up pound.
*  There's a lot of things that you can
*  a lot of variation.
*  I really like knees on the ground
*  but not elbows because you got because
*  I think I don't want to be better
*  stopped by a cut.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of cuts if someone's in a north south
*  position your knee and someone in the face
*  that be out.
*  Let me knock that be different
*  than a cut.
*  That's true. Yeah. I want to see guys like I said
*  I want to see I want to see guys I want to see
*  fights end.
*  I want to see them and buy a knockout.
*  I mean that would like to be able to use everything.
*  Yeah. I think knees to the ground
*  but also elbows I think everything on it.
*  Yeah. I just think that
*  especially the need of the ground
*  like you shouldn't be OK that
*  you should take down
*  and then you're safe.
*  Yeah. From in one because you're on all
*  fours that seems crazy to me.
*  Yeah. You're not safe.
*  It should be that the wrestlers forced
*  to roll to their back to avoid the knee
*  to get the fuck away.
*  It doesn't make any sense that you in
*  the center of the octagon you wouldn't
*  be able to hold on and knee someone in the head.
*  Look I'm a John Fitch one
*  of my best friends.
*  OK.
*  But to watch how he fought Roy McDonald
*  like for the fans sake it's not
*  a fun fight to watch like you grab
*  the leg and the guy like pushes out and
*  limp legs out and then you chase them on your knee
*  your hands and knees and you're fishing for the legs.
*  It's just not a fun fight.
*  And also to it makes it makes us
*  look like we don't know what the fuck we're doing.
*  Right. You know it's like I do John you're way
*  better than that.
*  But at the time you also don't want to stand
*  with Roy McDonald and that all changes
*  if you allow knees to the ground.
*  Yes it does.
*  Position the whole exchange changes.
*  Yep. You're going to see them start sprawling knee
*  in the head spawling and then the other thing as well.
*  Look if the wrestler is a good
*  obviously there are a lot of good wrestlers in the sport
*  but let's just say the knee misses and he's able
*  to grab the leg.
*  Now he can get the take down.
*  So there's benefits on both sides.
*  The guy needs it lands the guy get knocked
*  out. But if he needs any misses and I grab the leg
*  and I drive into you and take you down.
*  Now I'm on top fucking you up.
*  So there's different ways of looking at it like when you
*  sprawl you want to get your hips back get your legs back.
*  So when that happens that you've taken yourself
*  out of the equation of really engaging in action.
*  Yeah. Once you try to knee me in the head
*  now you're engaging back into the action where I
*  can grab you and take you down.
*  Dude I don't even think there should be a cage.
*  How about that. I think that's the problem.
*  He was doing a giant basketball
*  court sized matted
*  area. You remember there was those
*  like kumite style fights where they had the
*  mats that were kind of like Shamrock.
*  Yeah he had that.
*  And then somebody else tried doing it as well.
*  Well the World Combat League with Chuck Norris.
*  That's right. And then the
*  what they call it the fucking
*  Meyerowitz the guy who started the UFC
*  Bob Marlowe.
*  Yeah.
*  What is it the something
*  pit you.
*  Fucking weird name.
*  He came up with some weird name for the pit.
*  It like maybe it was like something pit fighting
*  championships. It was curved.
*  Yeah. The whole thing was curved like that.
*  I mean like I don't know
*  because like some guys kind of
*  run a lot as it is.
*  He's kind of crazy.
*  You know like this boss.
*  Oh that's right.
*  Boss Ruettens has an interesting
*  thing. Have you seen this.
*  No World Karate Combat League
*  or whatever the fuck it's called.
*  What is it called. Karate Combat.
*  Just called Karate Combat.
*  Yeah they have like these karate fights
*  and they fight inside this area
*  but they have this elevated outside.
*  But this is just stand up right.
*  Isn't it.
*  I believe so.
*  Yeah. But with it's interesting too because they
*  weren't pants but they're throwing low kicks
*  and shit and they have black belts on like it's
*  like all right.
*  I wonder where this is at.
*  This looks like it's somewhere in L.A.
*  I don't know. Their boss is still doing commentary
*  on that. They're morphing that changing it.
*  They're trying to evolve it.
*  But it's like Athens Greece actually.
*  That one is. Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay why not just do Muay Thai.
*  Where is your what's your take on the bare knuckle.
*  Boy I thought it was a great fucking idea until
*  I watched Chris Liebman when Chris Liebman
*  came back and his face was busted open.
*  I was like whoa that is a big cut.
*  Chris Liebman look like he got hit with an axe.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it caused a lot of cuts man.
*  I think it's going to break a lot of hands too.
*  Yeah it's going to definitely break a lot of hands.
*  Oh man.
*  If it depends if you like having vaginas on your forehead
*  you know that's kind of what the look is.
*  You're going for the look there.
*  It's also like a way where
*  you see guys who really should be done.
*  They get a couple more fights in there.
*  Yeah. And they're paying pretty well from what I understand.
*  Is it. What's a good.
*  I mean like for some of the guys that were
*  like I said they're trying to supplement the income they were
*  making before but if they can take half
*  and still be and still make money
*  for fights that don't go as long.
*  Hector Lombard is doing it.
*  Yeah. I mean it.
*  Gonzaga did it right against Bigfoot
*  and those guys. Yeah.
*  I mean Liebman is doing it.
*  Dakota Meyers.
*  No Dakota Cochran rather.
*  Dakota Meyers. Sorry Dakota.
*  UFC vet Tiago Alves inks new contract
*  with bare knuckle fighting.
*  Yeah.
*  I just I don't.
*  I think it's good but here's the thing is that the guys
*  they don't know the rules.
*  The rules are you can grab the head clinch
*  and dirty box you can punch the body that they just
*  they're taking in a kicker.
*  You're taking MMA guys though and making them
*  and they don't they're not they're not shaping their style
*  around the bare knuckle rules that they have.
*  Yeah. You can clinch and grab the head
*  and control and uppercut you know and
*  and those kind of things and if they did that
*  I think it'd be more of a real like bare knuckle
*  kind of gypsy style boxing.
*  Well Dan Henderson is going to do it.
*  Oh God. Yeah.
*  Dan Henderson side up for it.
*  Really. I was just with Dan in Hawaii
*  for the Bellator show there and
*  I didn't say anything about it.
*  We were also at karaoke at 3 in the morning.
*  So how many different
*  how many different bare knuckle organizations
*  are there. There's at least two right.
*  I think there's two.
*  Yeah. See if you find the Dan Henderson
*  fight if they if he's definitely
*  going through with that.
*  But I'm pretty sure they were getting him
*  maybe they're trying to get him to fight Lombard
*  but they have Lombard they have him
*  Gonzaga I don't know if he's going to keep doing it.
*  Chris Lieben.
*  Who else.
*  Well yeah I'm love off something night right
*  and then Jason night Jason night.
*  They fight again. Jason night's face was falling off
*  his last fight to the same thing.
*  What they look like.
*  Honestly when I see pitch when they're going to all look like
*  if you pull up a pitcher of hockey
*  players before they wear masks that's what they're
*  going to look like.
*  And it's not it's not attractive.
*  It's not attractive and I'm just thinking to myself no teeth
*  like you know sure you got mouthpieces but are you
*  wearing a are you wearing a duel a top and bottom mouthpiece
*  and like it just depends man.
*  I don't for me
*  once I realized I wasn't going to be the best
*  and I couldn't win a title.
*  You just got to go free I just had to go on.
*  Now I'm not knocking the people that they want to keep
*  doing it because they want to make money.
*  If you want to do it to make money just you know do it.
*  How about it. Like this is your this is your gig man.
*  This is your opportunity to make as much money as you
*  possibly can.
*  I just for me I just knew I knew I felt
*  like my whole career I was one of the best guys
*  in my division and I just wanted
*  I didn't know if I couldn't be the best and I want to do it
*  anymore. Yeah.
*  Well that makes sense.
*  I mean I appreciate your intelligence
*  and you're recognizing you know the landscape.
*  Some guys they just want to keep going and also
*  it's hard when you don't have paid as you've managed
*  to figure out a way to keep income
*  coming in through a bunch of different venues.
*  Yeah. Some guys don't figure that out
*  and then they get stuck and then they have to make a desperate
*  ploy. Major like
*  well if you have a family you have to think about what's
*  after you know and you got to find
*  ways to you know and you also
*  got to have someone that's there with you.
*  It takes care of it like you know is willing to like be
*  with you through it all not just through you when you were
*  making all the money you know that's that's another thing
*  I think a lot of a lot of fighters
*  attach themselves to the wrong spouse you know
*  and oh yeah and go you know or they
*  they want to live that lifestyle at the time
*  whether it's beach parties or pool parties in Vegas
*  or whatever it is but when that's done
*  or when that's when that when you're not the selfie
*  king anymore with all the fans at the pool parties
*  what happens when you're actually calling to try and make
*  reservations to get a table versus them calling you
*  and saying hey we have a table here for you at the pool.
*  Things change man and like you have to remember
*  that and so when that changes what are you
*  going to do after that. Right. And it's not going to
*  always be glamorous but you just got to
*  you know I think keeps got to come to reality
*  that life there's there's a ton of life after fighting
*  and if this is the one all sports
*  yeah you're only let's just say
*  you play not all of us are fucking Tom Brady play
*  till you're 55 you know crazy but
*  it's nuts but you have
*  you have a whole nother life after if
*  you let's say you live to be 80. Yes you have a whole
*  life like do they like you're just
*  the fucking beginning. I was listening to Gary
*  V. What's his name
*  Vandertsoek. Yeah and for
*  everyone this even for moments for myself
*  I was like man at
*  40 years old what are you going to do. Like what can
*  you really get yourself into like you know go become a cop
*  or firefighter. But it's just
*  the fucking beginning. Like you you
*  just just the beginning. I mean I got really
*  good at fighting in a couple of years. You'd be really
*  good at something else in one or two years. Yes
*  you know and does and just fucking make a ton of money.
*  Yeah it's almost like the organization should maybe
*  have some sort of seminars for fighters to try to give them
*  some sort of advice or give them some framework
*  to think about about how to pursue your life
*  after fighting. Yeah I
*  I've talked to jail about this a couple of times I said man
*  with Brendan
*  you know with jail you guys
*  those two guys I feel like people can say what they
*  want about Brendan and jail but what they've done
*  is they've done things to benefit themselves in a very
*  positive light. Yeah and I love and I love
*  being around people like that because even in
*  in just a casual conversation you
*  can learn a lot from them you know and I have
*  had this kind of like even with Big John like when he left
*  being a ref to become an analyst and it's just
*  like all the excuse me all the
*  stories that I've heard from him you know
*  you know while doing our show it's just
*  so much knowledge that he has from the sport
*  period from the way it was started the way he
*  got brought into it to the fights
*  that he's called and how it all went down and
*  and and I know there's two there's probably two sides
*  to every story but it's like at least there's you
*  get to hear certain parts of what happened throughout
*  the sport and I love I love
*  hearing I love absorbing all that you know and it's
*  it's great to to be to be
*  surrounded by people like that. Yeah I just
*  it would be nice if there was like a clear path that
*  fighters could take me and again it is nice at Bellator
*  and the UFC are using fighters
*  for analyst roles and things like that but
*  yeah fighters have to approach it like there's this
*  is a whole new world that you're entering
*  into approach it the same way you approach fighting
*  throw your everything into it if you want to be successful.
*  It's funny you say that because
*  I've worked with a lot of people that doing analyst stuff and
*  you already know what I'm going to say.
*  You already know. I don't even got to say it.
*  No the bottom line is these guys are going to show
*  up sometimes be like yeah I know what I'm doing
*  yeah and you and it's like you got it you got to be a student
*  of the game you really do you know I am that's what DC
*  really excels. Yeah. DC is awesome at that you know
*  he told Dominic Cruz you know Dominic Cruz is awesome
*  at that they excel. You have to
*  so like with DC brought up DC
*  what he has is he has a guy that does research for him
*  on the backside and Bellator does that they have a guy
*  for us as well and he gets us all the
*  stuff for the prelim fighters but you got to read it all.
*  Yeah. Yeah. You got to know who these guys are you got
*  to talk about them you got to be educated when you you talk
*  to them you got to remember you're trying to make
*  it about them not about you that's one two is you're trying
*  to make them the most dynamic
*  them the best fighter that's ever stopped in the cage
*  even though they're on the prelims of the prelims.
*  Okay it doesn't matter that guy is the future champion
*  you know so you you have to find ways
*  to highlight all the things that they do well and make them
*  out to be like they are the best and they potentially could
*  be the best just not found yet. When did you start doing your
*  podcast.
*  So I did it started doing about three years ago
*  but I didn't start with John till about six months ago.
*  Oh and so did it up just by yourself. Yeah so I had
*  me and there was another guy his name was Sammy the two of us
*  did one called Sammy the punk and I was doing that
*  with him and then I started doing
*  with John and then Sammy and I kind of Sammy
*  was basically doing some stuff with his wife and family and stuff
*  so we just kind of decided to part ways and I started
*  working started filming more with John.
*  And when you guys first started did you always do it.
*  You said you're doing it through FaceTime.
*  So with John yeah so I FaceTime John
*  in and we talked through FaceTime and then
*  we had to pull up. How do you film it through FaceTime.
*  Yep. That's crazy.
*  Yeah so much better than have you seen how
*  they do it. Jamie it's so much better than Skype.
*  When we did one with Edward Snowden we did it through
*  Google Hangouts and there's a weird
*  delay like they talk and then there's this weird
*  delay and you don't want to talk over him.
*  So it's awkward like person to person is the
*  best. Yeah you're right there you see each other
*  but FaceTime is fucking pretty close.
*  No it was there's no delay.
*  We John just calls in and then we record it
*  through I believe we have like a
*  an app or a sling. I think it's called slingshot or something like that.
*  He was halfway across the world too.
*  That's true. Allegedly we don't even know.
*  Correct. He might have been next door.
*  Might be a little delay.
*  We don't know where he is really. He's probably in your bathroom in the salt.
*  He's in Russia. He's crazy man.
*  Who knows.
*  Yeah so we just FaceTime him in and then my
*  producer we call him podcast Dave.
*  So he does
*  he basically just like he screenshots it
*  and just saves it and then John also does it on his
*  side. He sends him the video and then we record the audio
*  and then John records the audio so we just sync
*  he syncs up the audio to both so it matches.
*  That's cool. So we do both so there is no delay.
*  Oh that's excellent. That's excellent.
*  It's nice to have a producer. I got to tell you
*  I tried doing like the first 10 shows
*  with no producer. The visuals of the Snowden
*  podcast had no delay. But while you were recording
*  it there was. Yeah. I had to go back and fix it.
*  Yeah. Shout out to Jamie. I was going to say
*  I was going to say.
*  I was telling him before you walked
*  in I said hey don't be surprised if I turn
*  to you just because I want to be one of those other
*  like some of the other guests that just turn and go hey Jamie
*  pull this up.
*  It's a fun thing to say.
*  Yeah and he goes yeah but you know what there's moments
*  to do it though. They just never do it at the right time.
*  It's like dude I did Legion of Skanks
*  podcast and me and Tony Hinchcliffe
*  and the Legion of Skanks guys and
*  Jamie wasn't there and like
*  there was some shit I was trying to look up. I was like
*  hey find out if that's true.
*  I'm like fuck where's Jamie. And then
*  those guys are like how do you Google.
*  It just wasn't the same. It's not.
*  I swear I've tried a couple
*  when podcast Dave
*  wasn't there and Big John and I were trying to film. I was trying
*  to set everything up. I'm like where are all these chords
*  going. What buttons do I push.
*  I just and then so I FaceTime
*  him and he's like walking me through how to set
*  it all up and then the fucking
*  audio didn't record and we filmed for two hours
*  that day and I was like
*  I just told Dave I was like hey I was like I'm
*  not fucking ever filming again without you. Like when you said
*  you had to do the play
*  by play. Yes with Baroni. And you were
*  like I guess you told Goldie you're like I'm never
*  doing this fucking thing again.
*  Yeah that's the way you guys have it set up
*  it's very nice. I like it a lot. Yeah he's in
*  he's right outside of Nashville or Knoxville I
*  believe. So he's over there. He moved out
*  there now. He moved out of Vegas and lives over
*  there. He's in Tennessee. Yeah he's in Tennessee
*  from Simi Valley to he was telling
*  me how much he loves Vegas. No he loves it there.
*  He lives right on the fucking lake man. But what made
*  him move to Tennessee. His wife.
*  I mean they found a beautiful ranch.
*  I want to say his daughter I think is
*  out there now or living out there.
*  And she was in the military and so she's out there
*  but he's a man. He's been a amazing
*  man. He's been a man. He's a great guy. I mean
*  you want to talk about a pioneer. He was there from the fucking
*  jump. So that's the thing when him
*  and I. It's so funny because my last fight was
*  Petriki and I got drop of the head but John
*  was roughing and
*  he wasn't in the right. He was in the right position to see
*  it. So then I got hit right after that got locked
*  out. So he I
*  basically went to what
*  California said lead commission and
*  was trying to argue it was no contest
*  that you know they said it was a punch
*  and it was a headbutt. Anyways so
*  I'm just grilling John in the
*  in the process of you know fighting this
*  because they have John on speakerphone. I'm like I'm
*  telling John did you see it. John do this.
*  He's like texting me.
*  Josh I'm on your side man.
*  Stop yelling at me right now in front of everybody
*  and I was giving it to him. But then he
*  we both started working for Bellator and I
*  got to tell you man we hit it off. We hit it off
*  and it's just one of those things we would find ourselves
*  you know at the bar having a drink
*  after or before the show or after the show or during
*  the week of the fight. And it was like you know
*  8 o'clock 9 o'clock and next you know it's 2 in the
*  morning. It's just the two of us. Everyone else is gone and we're just
*  talking about fights man. Just talking about
*  guys we'd like to see fight. Guys that did
*  fight and how the fight went and
*  just everything. Talking about the beginning of UFC
*  talking about how he roughed certain fights in Japan
*  and just everything. And just like I said
*  it's nice. I enjoy being around
*  people that
*  that have like a walking book of knowledge.
*  So it's basically organic. You guys were
*  just doing this all the time. And they're like fuck man we should
*  record this. Yep let's do it. And then you know he used to
*  have a podcast. And so his podcast had
*  like a hundred or a hundred fifty thousand subscribers.
*  And I guess he had like a something
*  he said something on it one day and I guess Dana told
*  him hey you got to get rid of the podcast or we can't use you
*  anymore. Really? And so he just was like what did he say?
*  Fuck. He fought it a little bit and then
*  they got back on him and he just had to he deleted it.
*  Done. I'm like dude. You got to get rid of the podcast.
*  Fuck. Yeah I was like
*  man. And that was yeah.
*  So that's got to that's got to that's tough.
*  Well that's another argument to go to Bellator right?
*  Yeah I mean we've been doing it now so I
*  was at about eight seven thousand when
*  I started doing it with him six months ago and now
*  I think we're pushing sixteen thousand subscribers.
*  Not a lot but kind of surprised Colby Covington
*  doesn't have a podcast.
*  Right. Yeah how the fuck does he
*  not have one. But if it's your stick do you want to live that
*  stick on air then all of a sudden you become
*  Andrew Dice Clay.
*  Or maybe he gets even
*  more popular. Yeah. I mean
*  look he's fucking good at it man.
*  Colby's goddamn good at it. Let's be real.
*  Do you know him in person? No I do not know him.
*  Fucking nice guy. Is he? Smart as shit.
*  Nice guy. Works like a demon.
*  He's I mean you don't have
*  that kind of fucking cardio if you're lazy. I watched
*  I watched his one with Tommy Lauren because
*  Tommy Lauren actually reached out to me and she was out showing me
*  on the show this week and then this whole thing with the
*  impeachment thing she's like I can't.
*  You mean Candace Owens? No I have not met her.
*  No but it was Tommy Lauren he did a
*  podcast with. I thought he did a podcast with Candace Owens.
*  No he did one with Tommy Lauren.
*  Oh. Yeah he did one with Tommy Lauren.
*  When he talks about his whole persona
*  how he created his persona and everything like that.
*  No she was asking Tommy Lauren
*  and was asking about um
*  shit. I believe it was.
*  Was it Tommy Lauren? I think. Did he do more than
*  one podcast? No I don't know what it was a podcast
*  it was like a show like a TV.
*  I think she did like a 30 minute or hour long
*  whatever with him but she was mainly asking about Trump
*  like what do you like about him what do you support about him
*  what do you this what do you that. It wasn't a whole lot of the persona
*  talk going on. Do those people who love Trump
*  they love when someone else loves Trump. And right now
*  I mean if he'd go out to start a podcast this would be the time for him
*  to do it. I mean
*  that's kind of his shtick right now you know.
*  No you know who else could have a podcast? Maz
*  Vidal. Maz Vidal could have a podcast.
*  He's fucking everyday in a Versace
*  robe just chest out.
*  He's got to get the gold medallion
*  just fucking lay back you know.
*  I could just see it. If I was the man who made
*  the fucking calls.
*  I know they want to do him versus
*  Khabib versus Connor but Khabib
*  Maz Vidal versus Connor. Maz Vidal
*  versus Connor would be fucking giant.
*  When they had all the fighters
*  and they put a camera on them at the event when they put that camera
*  on Maz Vidal the pop from the audience was
*  fucking bonkers. He got the biggest pop of the night.
*  I don't doubt it. I don't doubt it at all.
*  He's a superstar right now. What people don't
*  realize when he fought KJ
*  Noons in
*  Strikeforce it was like a coming out party for him.
*  He made KJ look like he had no idea
*  what the fuck he was doing on the feet. I mean if you look
*  at the after pictures of KJ Noons
*  his face was he looked like the elephant
*  man. He fucked him up. He fucked him up.
*  And just that moment on he just
*  progressively got better. Sure he had some ups and downs.
*  He never turns down fights. He should have never fought
*  Damien Maia. If you're a
*  stand up guy with good wrestling take down defense
*  he probably shouldn't have fought him. He should be like
*  I don't want to fight that guy.
*  But he didn't. He fought the guy.
*  Good fight. He just didn't get the win.
*  But then he's just fucking
*  terror man. Just terror.
*  He's always been good. Always.
*  The weight cut I think killed him a little bit when he was trying to get down to 55
*  because he is a big guy.
*  Him and Connor is the fight to make. If I'm at home
*  I haven't seen enough of Connor
*  to show that he belonged in a cage with Khabib
*  yet. But him and
*  Maslid al if he starches or beats Maslid al
*  you can't. That would be the next fight
*  would be Khabib and him. The real question if he starts
*  yeah if he wants to make it to 55
*  again. You know some guys
*  especially when they get into their 30s
*  they just do better when they're not cutting as much weight
*  and Connor's a thick dude. He's probably
*  walking around a buck 85 or something like that
*  and for him to get down to 70 is not that
*  hard. For him to get down to 55 is a long
*  laborious process.
*  Yeah Dana said he only walks around 170.
*  Really? Yeah he said by the time
*  he fights tonight. I was
*  watching some of the presser stuff. He's like he's like he'd probably be 167.
*  I'm
*  195 and I stand next
*  to Connor. He does not look 170.
*  Yeah. He looks thick. Yeah. He looks
*  thick. I think he looked
*  he looked like he cut to make 172
*  when he got on a scale
*  he was wearing you know a bunch
*  of different layers. You know it was
*  standard shit. Yeah.
*  It was standard shit when someone's cutting.
*  It wasn't like a guy just shows up. Remember when
*  Eve used to weigh in and bring a fucking cheeseburger?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Like Eve didn't really cut.
*  No. You know there's a lot of guys like Frankie Edgar
*  perfect example. When he was the 55 pound
*  champ he didn't cut shit. No he was
*  eating. Yeah. You know when Frank Shamrock fought
*  Tito Ortiz he weighed him with quarters in his pocket.
*  You know it's like I guess the
*  commission said like you guys have to be within 10 pounds.
*  Wow. So Frank had to put quarters in his pocket
*  so he could fight Tito otherwise the commission wasn't
*  going to allow it. That's funny. So that was hilarious.
*  No but there's been a lot of guys that
*  you know that just don't feel the need to cut weight.
*  You know Khabib's got his huh? When they
*  go up you know a lot of times guys just have
*  better performances. Yeah. Khabib's had
*  some serious problems making 55.
*  Yeah he has. I honestly believe
*  I don't think he will.
*  I would like to see the fight to me
*  these are my dream fights is
*  I would like to see Patricio
*  and Volkanovski or Patricio
*  and Max. I would love to see that fight. I would love to see
*  GSP and Khabib.
*  That to me is the fight. The biggest fight
*  I think that that blows everything away.
*  That's a huge fight. You know
*  Mazadol and Conor. Huge fight.
*  You know those like these are fights
*  that are like you know Lima against P and Conor.
*  GSP and Conor as well.
*  That here's the thing. That fight would have should
*  have been made before he lost to Khabib.
*  I'm surprised that they didn't do that.
*  Yeah. I'm so
*  surprised. You know here's the other thing though is it
*  it kind of I think is hindering
*  and I think you brought me up on this before because
*  I had heard through a lot of people in the UFC that they were
*  talking and negotiating trying to think about ways
*  to bring in 165. Yes. And you have
*  too many tweeners and what's that. Why do we have
*  a 15 pound gap for the 55 with all
*  the talent that is there. Preach.
*  Let's do it. Preach it.
*  Let's do it man. Let's do 55, 65,
*  75. Yes. Move those guys
*  to 75. Some of those guys like Usman could
*  use a little bit of that. Oh yeah. You know.
*  He's so big. You know and then you'll have guys
*  like I don't know how big Colby is but Colby
*  to maybe 65 or Colby to 75.
*  He can do 75. He's a big guy too.
*  Lima's enormous dude.
*  Enormous. What does he walk around
*  at? Got to be 202 to
*  maybe 205. Yeah.
*  He's a big fella. He's a big guy.
*  And no fat. None. None at all. I saw a picture
*  he's in somewhere on an island
*  right now but he just looks shredded
*  right now. Like he's not even a fight camp.
*  What is next for him? I think
*  they're waiting to see what's going to go on.
*  From what I understand they're not going to do the MVP
*  rematch right away. MVP is going to have to fight someone
*  of significant
*  significance. Yeah. He got some shit
*  for his last opponent. Right. Yeah. But look you have
*  his last two opponents.
*  The guy that he fought in Japan
*  it was a last minute replacement because Benson Henderson
*  got hurt. So when Ben got taken out the
*  card against Chandler Japan was like
*  look we need somebody else to step up.
*  We need another talented guy on there because now
*  you're supplementing him with somebody else.
*  Benson. We need another big name.
*  So they brought in MVP and fought
*  one of the Japanese guys. And that
*  he stepped up on short notice to take that fight.
*  I tipped my hat to him and he still made him look bad
*  and finished him out. Yeah. The other
*  the couple fights before that.
*  Look these guys are asking for it. But stylists
*  and not stylistically but
*  his fight in Italy. That guy
*  was Italy? No it was London.
*  That guy was a last minute replacement
*  also and that guy was 13 and 1. Right.
*  He's just so awkward. His style
*  is so difficult to deal with. You know hands
*  down low and that karate blitz style.
*  Did you ever see when he fought Raymond
*  Daniels in point fighting? No I did not.
*  I saw him fight Alfie Davis. That was a good fight
*  too. But there's something to that
*  point fighting style that
*  really can apply to MMA
*  if they learn all the other stuff. Because that
*  ability to blitz, to jump in and jump out
*  and not get hit. And there's a lot of those guys
*  that are fucking masters at that.
*  That's my next dream fight. Let's see those
*  guys fight in MMA. Yeah. Like you have Raymond
*  Daniels and you have MVP. I mean
*  I don't know if Raymond Daniels is even interested
*  in MMA. I don't know if he does any
*  He's fighting this weekend. Raymond Daniels
*  in Bellator. He's fighting in MMA.
*  Has he fought MMA before? Jamie I'm going to call
*  on you right now. I'm going to call on you right now buddy.
*  He was on ESPN for one of the best knockouts last
*  year in history. In MMA? Yeah he did a 920
*  spin, came back through with a punch and dropped the guy.
*  I called the fight. I didn't even know if that was MMA.
*  That was him. I called the fight and it was in
*  Birmingham. That 920
*  spinning punch. Why do I think that was kickboxing?
*  No that was in, he dropped him with a side kick.
*  The guy got up. He jumped spin, spun
*  like I don't know. Some astronomical amount of times.
*  When I see him fight, my stupid
*  brain immediately goes kickboxing. How many
*  MMA fights has he had? I want to say he's got
*  two. He's got
*  two. This will be his third. So like Joe
*  Schilling has decided to abandon the
*  kickboxing aspect and move on. See the
*  only thing that bothers me with that is, there he is.
*  One, one and oh.
*  Yeah so he's. Yeah January
*  25th. Oh he's fighting in
*  Inglewood next week. Yeah he's on the, he's on
*  our card with Cyborg. That's not even next
*  week. That's three days. Yeah
*  Saturday. Oh beautiful. And who's he fighting?
*  Jason King? Okay.
*  That's cool. So but how
*  old is Raymond now? I want to say he's 42.
*  40. Huh?
*  Oh sorry. 39. I let us down.
*  He's just decided to
*  at this point, get into MMA.
*  Look man, on the feet, good fucking luck.
*  Good luck even getting close to that guy. He's got a weird
*  style. He's always, sorry.
*  Is my phone going off?
*  He's got a weird style.
*  You know, that point fighting
*  style and then the successful
*  transition from point fighting to kickboxing.
*  You know, I mean he was a phenomenal kick
*  boxer and then for going from kick
*  boxing to MMA. It's very interesting. Yeah
*  I think when guys that feel like they've
*  hit the top at whatever they're doing and
*  there's no, there's nowhere else to go. Let's go wherever
*  we can to make as much money as we can. He's always
*  had a relationship with Scott Coker. That's the other thing.
*  A lot of what you see from the guys, like
*  Gagart came back to Coker, Cyborg's coming back
*  to Coker. I went back. You know, there's a lot of guys
*  that had fought in Strikeforce
*  when they were relatively new. There was a lot of talk
*  that, you know, if Kane never left
*  he was going to potentially go back to, he was going to go to
*  Coker as well. If he was able to leave, yeah.
*  Because he had had his first fight
*  was in Strikeforce and he had a relationship with them.
*  Well when Kane says his back's all
*  fucked up and I'm sure it is, but then you see him do
*  the luch livery, jumps up
*  and scissors this guy's head and does
*  fucking flips. Like hey, how are you doing that?
*  Which is super impressive for a guy
*  who's 245, 250, right?
*  I swear to God I never thought I could
*  see him, I never thought I'd see him jump that high.
*  Well he must have loved that shit because if he can do
*  those moves that means he's been working on this.
*  He's one of those guys that his
*  athleticism is just overlooked
*  all the time because of the way he looks.
*  His physical body, his physical appearance. Like Fador.
*  Yeah, exactly. But you have to admit,
*  Fador's probably one of the most athletic
*  heavyweights I've seen. And the same thing with Kane.
*  I would underestimate them because of their body style.
*  Yeah, it's funny.
*  It's like show muscles versus go muscles.
*  But with Kane, like his fucking
*  endurance was terrifying.
*  His endurance for a heavyweight just didn't
*  even make sense. I don't know if
*  there's some truth behind this, but they were talking about how
*  guys that are normally barrel chested
*  bigger lungs, but they
*  normally have a lot more cardio.
*  And it seemed to be like most of the guys that I
*  had seen, they have extremely good cardio.
*  Look at Keith Jardine. Same thing.
*  Remember him? And then Kane.
*  I've seen guys with big barrel chest
*  that have good... Think about Junior Dos Santos.
*  Dos Santos, yeah. Look at him.
*  He's got really good cardio for someone who
*  that pace him and Kane fought at.
*  That's insane for heavyweights. Insane.
*  If Kane didn't have that type of pace,
*  I mean, it would have been...
*  It could have been a different fight. It would have been a different fight.
*  But Kane's pace just was superhuman.
*  It didn't make sense.
*  But it's also like those guys that have that
*  kind of pace are never one shot knockout artists.
*  You know? You notice that?
*  Those guys, they can put that...
*  That's one of the more interesting things about the sport.
*  There's all these trade-offs.
*  It's like you want to have that super one shot knockout power?
*  Well, then you're not going to be able to do it very often.
*  You blow your gas out. It's like having a big V8
*  engine. You stomp on the gas. It drains that tank.
*  It's true, yeah.
*  You see it though with
*  with
*  explosive guys, right? Like Connor.
*  It seems like in the five round fights,
*  he struggles a little bit. Like in that fourth and fifth round,
*  it's not the same pace he had in ones, two, and sometimes
*  into three in the third round. He comes out hot.
*  Yeah. I mean, maybe that will all go away
*  if he stays at 170.
*  But then you're fighting guys that are 205.
*  Yeah. I mean, he's extremely
*  good.
*  But I mean, and I'm kind of
*  on the Brendan way.
*  I'm a Connor Nutrider, man. I think I like what he's done
*  in the sport.
*  I don't see him beating Khabib.
*  And I've had this conversation with Brendan a lot.
*  Like ever. I don't see him beating
*  him ever. Like ever.
*  What does Brendan think?
*  Well, here's the thing. Brendan used to give me this whole
*  spiel because I was on his
*  show Below the Belt as well. And we had this conversation
*  right before the fight happened.
*  And he goes,
*  oh, if he fights the way he fought against Ali Quinta
*  and this and that, I'm like, it's completely
*  different. You're trying to shoot
*  for Khabib to shoot on Ali Quinta
*  who's like 5'7".
*  It's a different game than shooting on somebody who's 5'11".
*  Yeah, and a good wrestler.
*  And he's got some pop in his hands.
*  And he knows, and he knew with the fight
*  that he knew that Khabib was going to try to take him down.
*  Khabib's,
*  people got to remember, during that week, Khabib went through
*  five or six opponents. Remember, it was supposed to be Pettis,
*  supposed to be somebody else, supposed to be, like,
*  they went through all these people.
*  Max Holloway, they pulled him off the weight cut.
*  That's right. Yeah, I mean, it was literally the last minute.
*  And so when all of that happens,
*  you're not the same fighter you were when you showed up
*  in Vegas or wherever the fight was supposed to be thinking you're
*  going to fight this person. And so
*  I cut him a little slack in that fight.
*  And then fighting someone like Ali Quinta, who's a fucking
*  savage, that guy, like, he's so good.
*  He's nails, tough as nails.
*  Never gets the credit he deserved.
*  Absolute savage. And
*  he's a gamer. And so when you have to shoot on someone, I don't know
*  how tall he is, a 5'7", 5'8",
*  you know, but it's a lot harder to get low
*  on someone like that and get the take down on him.
*  So when I was telling him, Brennan, like,
*  he's like, if he stands with him, he's going to get knocked out.
*  Well, who did the dropping in that fight?
*  You know, it was Khabib. Khabib did the dropping because
*  when you make someone fear your take down that
*  much, your natural reaction is to drop your
*  hands real quick to try to get the underhooks. And he threw that
*  right hand like a fastball, too. It was like a whip.
*  And so what he, and that's in all the years I've
*  trained with him, he's just learned what he does.
*  He drops and dips his head and comes back over
*  with the overhand left or the overhand right
*  and it finds its mark. He sees
*  it before he throws it.
*  And most guys will just throw blindly.
*  He dips his head, comes back up and he sees
*  his shot and then he throws it.
*  It's different and the majority of the time it lands.
*  And I've been on the other end of that shit quite a bit.
*  I can't fucking stand it.
*  Well, listen, brother, we just did three hours. Can you believe that?
*  Walk in the park. Time just fucking flew by.
*  Walk in the park. Tell people how to get a hold of your
*  podcast with Big John. It's called Weighing In.
*  It's called Weighing In. Yeah, we're on
*  YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud,
*  Google Play, all the platforms. We're on all the
*  platforms. And then I own a gym and a clothing
*  line called Knox. So tell people your
*  Instagram and... Yep, Instagram is
*  at the real punk. So the real punk
*  is my Instagram. Beautiful. Glad we finally did this, brother.
*  I appreciate you. Thank you so much, Joe.
*  Josh Thompson, ladies and gentlemen. Goodbye.
*  See ya.
