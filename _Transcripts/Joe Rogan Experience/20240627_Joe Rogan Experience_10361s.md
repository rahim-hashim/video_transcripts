*  For the first comedian. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=51.0s)]
*  All the way from Nashville to the sea. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=53.0s)]
*  Dio Vaughn. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=55.0s)]
*  Bro, you got a standing O. What's up? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=61.0s)]
*  Crazy, dude. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=63.0s)]
*  You spent the first 30 seconds of your set high-fiving people. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=65.0s)]
*  Come on, son. Look at this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=71.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=73.0s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=74.0s)]
*  Some dude threw some semen up at me, I think. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=76.0s)]
*  Real semen? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=78.0s)]
*  Like in that movie, Silence of the Lambs. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=79.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if it was real or not. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=81.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe it was the guy locked in the cell. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=83.0s)]
*  Yeah, I batted it down. I respected it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=85.0s)]
*  But yeah, dude, that was awesome, man. Thank you. Congrats. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=89.0s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=92.0s)]
*  Congrats, because I remember last time I was here, we went and you walked me through and you were like, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=93.0s)]
*  this is where the light's going to go when you go on. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=98.0s)]
*  You had everything to it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=100.0s)]
*  How long ago was that? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=102.0s)]
*  That was last July. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=103.0s)]
*  Okay, so last July, there was... [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=105.0s)]
*  We hadn't even raised the floors yet, right? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=109.0s)]
*  Y'all were just talking about it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=112.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was before we lowered the ceiling and raised the floors. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=114.0s)]
*  So you got in when it looked like a movie theater. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=118.0s)]
*  It still looked like the old movie theater, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=121.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think you were just talking about adjusting the floor heights and doing something like that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=123.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude, it was awesome. I mean, that was crazy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=127.0s)]
*  That was probably... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=129.0s)]
*  That was a highlight of my life, I think. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=131.0s)]
*  I think so, too. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=136.0s)]
*  Because you get to be a surprise. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=138.0s)]
*  There's not as much surprises anymore in the world, you know? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=140.0s)]
*  It's true. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=142.0s)]
*  So to have a moment where you're part of a surprise, I think, felt really good. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=144.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it looked like. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=148.0s)]
*  So when you were there, it was all rough and everything was just beginning. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=150.0s)]
*  So you were there in the early days. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=157.0s)]
*  It's weird to be in there now because... [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=158.0s)]
*  I mean, I want to sound crazy, but I feel like that place has always been there. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=161.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=167.0s)]
*  Like the club has always been there? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=168.0s)]
*  Yeah, the club. It's like it was waiting for us. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=170.0s)]
*  Like a Stephen King book, for real. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=173.0s)]
*  I've never been in a building that felt more like it was conscious. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=177.0s)]
*  The place feels conscious. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=182.0s)]
*  My daughter's into ghosts and shit, and she has this thing that she puts on, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=185.0s)]
*  this headphone that's connected to some box, and someone will ask questions, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=190.0s)]
*  and the box will pick up random signals, and you're blindfolded and you listen to this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=198.0s)]
*  And so they do this to test places for ghosts, and she says that place is haunted. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=204.0s)]
*  She said the club is? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=210.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=211.0s)]
*  Oh, I believe that. I could see it being haunted probably. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=212.0s)]
*  She's also 12. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=214.0s)]
*  Well, I'm older than her, but I would agree with her probably. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=217.0s)]
*  I mean, I could see there being... I will say this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=220.0s)]
*  It felt like there was some kind of... [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=222.0s)]
*  It felt... I can understand when you say this feels like it should have been there over time in history. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=226.0s)]
*  Like it's already was just supposed to land there. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=231.0s)]
*  That's what it feels like. It really does. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=234.0s)]
*  It was cool, man. I walked into the green. It was just crazy. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=238.0s)]
*  There's like that big snake. There's like a snake in the table. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=241.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=245.0s)]
*  And then they had Ron White is sitting there, you know, and then Tom Segura was in there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=246.0s)]
*  David Tell was in there. Louis Katz. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=254.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=257.0s)]
*  Ian... I don't know Ian's last name, but... [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=258.0s)]
*  It was... Yeah, dude, it was awesome, man. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=261.0s)]
*  And just to see it come to fruition, that was... I think that's the thing that was really exciting. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=263.0s)]
*  It was like, wow, like if somebody thinks about something and they're really focused on it, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=267.0s)]
*  that they can make something real. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=272.0s)]
*  You can actually make something happen. And I've never done that before. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=274.0s)]
*  This is the first time I've ever done that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=277.0s)]
*  It was... Yeah, I think it was inspiring. Probably in ways I don't even realize. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=280.0s)]
*  Because sometimes you get inspired and then it like just hits you later, you know. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=284.0s)]
*  But it was awesome, man. Thank you. It was cool. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=287.0s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=289.0s)]
*  Yeah, you did. I mean, you... Yeah, you guys are making it happen. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=290.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=293.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=294.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it... You know, I always kind of knew you could do something like that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=295.0s)]
*  But doing it, actually doing it and actually watching it take place and doing it like relatively low stress. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=301.0s)]
*  It was relatively low stress. Like it's, you know, except for a few issues that you have to deal with at the club. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=307.0s)]
*  It's not a big deal. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=314.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=317.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=318.0s)]
*  And y'all don't have food, right? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=319.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a big one. Fuck food. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=320.0s)]
*  Yeah, all the condiments and all of that just stains everything and gets on everything, I feel like. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=322.0s)]
*  Not only that, you get roaches and all kinds of other shit. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=328.0s)]
*  Roaches love ketchup, I bet. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=331.0s)]
*  Do they? Everybody loves ketchup. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=333.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=335.0s)]
*  I like ketchup on hot dogs. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=336.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, I bet if you could really get it out of a roach, if you fucking tickled him hard enough, he'd tell you he liked it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=338.0s)]
*  I like relish. Relish is my favorite. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=343.0s)]
*  Yeah, but we got food next door on both sides of us. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=346.0s)]
*  Yeah, they got everything. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=349.0s)]
*  Shitty Mexican food and shitty pizza. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=350.0s)]
*  Yeah. Just what comics deserve to. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=352.0s)]
*  We got some good pizza last night, though. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=356.0s)]
*  They got some good, I'm not eating it, but Attell got something from some high end pizza place. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=358.0s)]
*  Hoboken something, pizza something. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=364.0s)]
*  He's the funniest man. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=366.0s)]
*  Yeah, they had a lot of ghost stuff. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=368.0s)]
*  Like I grew up in Louisiana, right? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=371.0s)]
*  And so ghosts and stuff was a big part of the history, you know, especially in the South. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=373.0s)]
*  You know, I think. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=380.0s)]
*  What do you think a ghost is? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=382.0s)]
*  A ghost? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=384.0s)]
*  Probably just some busy body that just didn't get all their stuff done. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=386.0s)]
*  Oh, they were lazy when they were alive. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=390.0s)]
*  So they hang around after like, you know what it's like? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=392.0s)]
*  It's like those dudes who would hang around the high school after they already graduated. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=395.0s)]
*  Like, what are you doing, loser? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=399.0s)]
*  Yeah, look at this ghost over here. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=404.0s)]
*  Look at this ghost. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=406.0s)]
*  Oh, they had a dude who would bring like, who was always dating like an underage chick. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=407.0s)]
*  And he'd come and like hand the McDonald's over the fence at our school. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=412.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=415.0s)]
*  Oh, and everybody. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=416.0s)]
*  How old was he? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=417.0s)]
*  Oh, everybody thought he was damn Prince Charles. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=418.0s)]
*  Everybody thought he was like the luckiest guy in the world. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=420.0s)]
*  But he was older. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=422.0s)]
*  He just like was an adult and like a 20 year old adult or like a 30 year old adult. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=424.0s)]
*  It gets exponentially creepier. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=429.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=432.0s)]
*  Like if you just graduated and you're 18 and your girlfriend is 17, that shit is completely normal. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=433.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=439.0s)]
*  But if you're 19 and she's 17, people start to look a little sideways. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=440.0s)]
*  Huh? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=444.0s)]
*  That extra 12 months makes a big difference. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=445.0s)]
*  If you're 20 and she's 17, people will get very upset with you, even in places where it's legal, where it is legal in a few places, which is kind of weird. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=447.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=456.0s)]
*  And if you are 35 and she's 17, you can't be a comedian anymore. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=457.0s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=461.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=463.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=467.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=469.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=470.0s)]
*  But it's weird like what's legal versus what's OK. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=471.0s)]
*  Like it really depends on men. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=474.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=477.0s)]
*  Because with men, like if a 17 year old boy, if some 40 year old lady fucks a 17 year old boy, I'm like, all right, dude, how was it? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=478.0s)]
*  Is she crazy? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=486.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=487.0s)]
*  If she's hot and he's not coerced and drugged, who cares? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=489.0s)]
*  But if a 40 year old man is banging a 17 year old girl, I get very upset. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=494.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=499.0s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=500.0s)]
*  It's a very different standard for men and women. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=501.0s)]
*  Well, now I think a lot of women can be like they can manipulate men too. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=504.0s)]
*  Of course they can. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=511.0s)]
*  They've always been able to do that. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=512.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=513.0s)]
*  But that never really kind of gets brought into context. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=514.0s)]
*  Like a lot of older teacher women, they can manipulate a young fellow. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=516.0s)]
*  Oh, they're getting busted all the time. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=521.0s)]
*  They're always getting busted. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=523.0s)]
*  But they get this. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=524.0s)]
*  They get don't do that again. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=525.0s)]
*  Hey, stop blowing kids. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=527.0s)]
*  That's what they get. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=529.0s)]
*  They get a little slap on the wrist. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=530.0s)]
*  They don't go to jail. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=532.0s)]
*  They go to jail for blowing kids. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=533.0s)]
*  No, you think they don't? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=535.0s)]
*  No, I think they have like a little fucking trial and everything. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=537.0s)]
*  They go, hey, get out of here. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=540.0s)]
*  Yeah, just get just go crazy dick sucker. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=542.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to get you an Uber. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=546.0s)]
*  You need to go home. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=548.0s)]
*  Unless she's trying to get the 17-year-old to impregnate her, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=549.0s)]
*  then you need to go to jail, you freaky bitch. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=553.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I'm... [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=556.0s)]
*  Ruin some 17-year-old's life. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=557.0s)]
*  With a kid, yeah. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=559.0s)]
*  Well, not just a kid, a kid with you. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=560.0s)]
*  He doesn't know what's going on. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=563.0s)]
*  He's just trying to bust a nut. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=564.0s)]
*  Then all of a sudden he has the responsibility of raising a child [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=566.0s)]
*  and you're making him get a job and he's got to fucking pay bills. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=568.0s)]
*  What about his future? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=571.0s)]
*  He's going to fail science. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=573.0s)]
*  I know that. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=574.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=575.0s)]
*  Just because he's not going to be able to do it all. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=576.0s)]
*  I don't think I'm going to be able to have the job and get to school [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=577.0s)]
*  and do it all and take care of the kid. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=579.0s)]
*  I don't think a child, you know... [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=581.0s)]
*  Well, good news is it takes nine months for the kid to come out. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=583.0s)]
*  So you have nine months of prep time where you get your shit together. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=586.0s)]
*  Do a lot of men you think use that time to really grow up when that's that? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=590.0s)]
*  You think that's why God made it that long of a time period? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=593.0s)]
*  I do not think God had men in mind when he was doing that, no. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=596.0s)]
*  If there is a God, I think they just wanted to make sure that... [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=601.0s)]
*  The baby's a complicated organism. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=604.0s)]
*  Very complicated. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=607.0s)]
*  More complicated than any other child of any other animal that's ever been born. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=609.0s)]
*  Human babies are the weirdest. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=613.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=614.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's why they come out so vulnerable. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=615.0s)]
*  Every other animal comes out and they can move around. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=616.0s)]
*  For the most part. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=619.0s)]
*  Although I did see a deer just a couple of days ago on my street. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=620.0s)]
*  I was going for a walk and the mama deer bounced off a little [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=623.0s)]
*  and I saw this little tiny baby deer squatted down and laid down the grass [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=628.0s)]
*  because that's what they do when they're really, really young. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=633.0s)]
*  They can't run away from anything. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=635.0s)]
*  So their best strategy is to kind of blend in and hide. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=637.0s)]
*  That's why they have those white dots all over their body. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=640.0s)]
*  The white dots, like say if they're in grass, the white dots obscure their shape. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=642.0s)]
*  So predators might not see. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=648.0s)]
*  And I think there's something about their smell. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=650.0s)]
*  Google that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=653.0s)]
*  We finally have internet again. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=654.0s)]
*  Google what is the smell of newborn fawns? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=656.0s)]
*  Because I think there's like some strategy that nature has with their smell. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=661.0s)]
*  Yeah, the baby deer has no scent. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=666.0s)]
*  So predators that may depend on their sense of smell have difficulty finding the young deer. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=670.0s)]
*  The mother always close at hand tends to circle back towards where her baby lies [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=675.0s)]
*  to get the attention of the predator. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=679.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they did with us. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=680.0s)]
*  So they're like that deal. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=682.0s)]
*  They're like that. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=683.0s)]
*  Oh, it's false. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=684.0s)]
*  It says it's false. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=685.0s)]
*  Oh, this one's where the fuck is the first one from? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=686.0s)]
*  The Henderson State University. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=688.0s)]
*  The Henderson State University. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=690.0s)]
*  What a shit fucking university. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=691.0s)]
*  No, go to the top. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=692.0s)]
*  Is that where it's from? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=693.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=694.0s)]
*  What a fucking. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=695.0s)]
*  Hey, I got my fucking degree from Henderson. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=696.0s)]
*  Dan Henderson. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=699.0s)]
*  He's his principal. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=700.0s)]
*  I asked him what baby deer smell like. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=703.0s)]
*  He goes, what are you a fucking douchebag smelling deers? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=705.0s)]
*  This is false. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=709.0s)]
*  Oh, fucking pop up for a fucking outdoor tactical backpack. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=710.0s)]
*  This is false. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=714.0s)]
*  Their unique scent is how their mothers identify them. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=715.0s)]
*  In fact, they urinate on their tarsal glands daily, even when just a few days old. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=717.0s)]
*  They're freaks, man. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=723.0s)]
*  They're pissing on themselves, going crazy. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=724.0s)]
*  Elk piss on themselves when they're horny. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=726.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=729.0s)]
*  Yeah, their dick is hard and their dick flops up and down when they scream. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=730.0s)]
*  They're, brrraaahhh! [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=733.0s)]
*  Their dick flops and they start pissing all over themselves. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=735.0s)]
*  They piss all over themselves. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=738.0s)]
*  I've never been that. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=740.0s)]
*  Look at this guy. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=742.0s)]
*  I've never been that horny. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=743.0s)]
*  This dude's horny as fuck. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=744.0s)]
*  He's a young fella. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=745.0s)]
*  That's not a big elk. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=746.0s)]
*  Even though they're big because they're all big, but that is like a smaller elk. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=748.0s)]
*  That's like a 300 inch elk, if I had to guess. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=754.0s)]
*  Kam Ains might correct me. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=758.0s)]
*  Look at his dick though. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=759.0s)]
*  He's got a dick. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=760.0s)]
*  Yeah, fucking scratching on the ground. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=761.0s)]
*  And he's trying to get his scent everywhere. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=763.0s)]
*  He's got that limb on him, huh? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=765.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=766.0s)]
*  Look, his dick's flopping around. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=767.0s)]
*  See, he's pissing all over himself. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=769.0s)]
*  And then he's laying around. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=770.0s)]
*  He's like, oh, they want to fuck so bad. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=771.0s)]
*  That's a Joe Joe. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=773.0s)]
*  That's Joe's juice right there. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=774.0s)]
*  That thing is serving, huh? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=775.0s)]
*  You know what's crazy about them? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=777.0s)]
*  They're only horny like that for like a month. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=778.0s)]
*  Yeah, thank God, dude. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=780.0s)]
*  They would ruin a schoolyard. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=782.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that if they ran onto a schoolyard. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=784.0s)]
*  If they're horny and people get stupid, oh, take a selfie. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=786.0s)]
*  They get fucking speared like a 700 pound super athlete. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=790.0s)]
*  I would hate having that much wiener, I feel like. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=796.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=799.0s)]
*  You don't know until you have it. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=800.0s)]
*  You just have to find the right gals. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=801.0s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=803.0s)]
*  You think so? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=804.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=805.0s)]
*  I feel... [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=806.0s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=807.0s)]
*  Don't show me this. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=808.0s)]
*  Don't show me this. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=809.0s)]
*  I think this one was okay. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=810.0s)]
*  This actually wasn't the one I was looking for. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=811.0s)]
*  Oh, you crazy bitch. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=813.0s)]
*  Get the fuck away from that thing. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=814.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=816.0s)]
*  It just happens to have the bison kind of attack, but it didn't keep attacking. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=817.0s)]
*  Why are people so goddamn stupid for the Gram? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=821.0s)]
*  You know how many people have died taking selfies? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=824.0s)]
*  I saw this video the other day on Instagram of this lady who died taking a selfie on the [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=827.0s)]
*  side of a cliff. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=832.0s)]
*  And can you imagine too the like... [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=833.0s)]
*  Because you know what's going on. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=836.0s)]
*  There's a moment where you realize, oh, I'm taking a selfie and I'm going to die. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=837.0s)]
*  No, I don't think they realize it until it's too late. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=841.0s)]
*  See, she was posing for a picture here and the bison sort of just said, get the fuck away [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=844.0s)]
*  from me. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=849.0s)]
*  Yeah, he just gave her a little of that. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=850.0s)]
*  Like, get the fuck away. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=851.0s)]
*  Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=852.0s)]
*  Look at her. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=853.0s)]
*  She's so uncoordinated. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=854.0s)]
*  Yeah, she was too. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=855.0s)]
*  With her stupid backpack filled with fucking Capri Suns. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=856.0s)]
*  She's falling down. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=859.0s)]
*  Doof! [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=860.0s)]
*  Doof! [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=861.0s)]
*  Fucking potato chips in her backpack and shit. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=862.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, I saw a monkey at a young black woman fight over a bag of chips. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=867.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of those. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=872.0s)]
*  Monkeys will steal your shit. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=873.0s)]
*  Cambodia, yeah. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=874.0s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=875.0s)]
*  They will steal your shit. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=876.0s)]
*  They will run up on your table and steal your food right off your plate. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=877.0s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=880.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=881.0s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=882.0s)]
*  Give me that sandwich. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=883.0s)]
*  And they just run off with it. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=884.0s)]
*  They don't care, man. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=885.0s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=886.0s)]
*  You know what, was it India where the monkeys started jacking puppies? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=887.0s)]
*  In India, a dog killed a monkey, so these monkeys went on a rampage and started chucking [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=891.0s)]
*  puppies off roofs. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=897.0s)]
*  They would carry puppies to the top of roofs and would like, right, fucking chuck them [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=899.0s)]
*  off the roofs. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=902.0s)]
*  Like a Maltese. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=904.0s)]
*  Yeah, monkeys blamed for hundreds of puppy deaths captured in India. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=906.0s)]
*  So, they'd bring them up to the top of a fucking building and throw them. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=910.0s)]
*  Fuck a Maltese. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=914.0s)]
*  Maltese, yeah. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=915.0s)]
*  Maltese claim animals were carrying out revenge killings after dogs killed an infant monkey. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=916.0s)]
*  Speaking of which, have you seen what's going on with orcas? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=920.0s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=923.0s)]
*  So, a female orca, the matriarch, the head of this female orca pack, the head of this [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=924.0s)]
*  orca pack. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=930.0s)]
*  And when you say orcas, what are you talking about? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=931.0s)]
*  Killer whales. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=933.0s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=934.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=935.0s)]
*  That's orca. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=936.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=937.0s)]
*  So, they started sinking boats, and they're teaching each other how to sink boats. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=938.0s)]
*  Apparently, this boat fucked up one of these orcs. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=942.0s)]
*  Because sometimes what happens is something will go wrong and a propeller will hit. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=945.0s)]
*  They've happened all the time with sharks. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=950.0s)]
*  It's happened with whales. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=952.0s)]
*  Propellers will fuck up a dolphin or a orca. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=954.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=957.0s)]
*  My friend Dave got pushed off a boat and he got hit by it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=958.0s)]
*  We went over him. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=961.0s)]
*  He got pushed off the front. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=962.0s)]
*  Oh, jeez. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=963.0s)]
*  And it fucking hit him. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=964.0s)]
*  Where did it hit him? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=965.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=966.0s)]
*  He wasn't that great to start off with, but it didn't help him. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=967.0s)]
*  I don't think it harmed him much. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=970.0s)]
*  It helps some people. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=971.0s)]
*  Some people get whacked and it helps them. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=972.0s)]
*  Kinnison and Roseanne are my two favorite examples. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=975.0s)]
*  They both got hit by cars. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=978.0s)]
*  Wildest people I know. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=981.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know Kinnison, but I know Roseanne real well. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=982.0s)]
*  She got hit by a fucking car when she was 15. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=985.0s)]
*  Bad. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=988.0s)]
*  She was in a mental institution for nine months afterwards. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=989.0s)]
*  She was a straight-A student. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=992.0s)]
*  She couldn't count afterwards. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=994.0s)]
*  She couldn't do math. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=995.0s)]
*  Couldn't do anything. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=996.0s)]
*  That's unreal. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=997.0s)]
*  The lady, she was driving towards the sun and the lady couldn't see. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=998.0s)]
*  And Roseanne walked right into the street when she was 15 and got fucking clipped by [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1004.0s)]
*  a car from back then. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1009.0s)]
*  Those big old fucking sleds. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1011.0s)]
*  Oh, those things minted. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1013.0s)]
*  Caprice or something like that. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1014.0s)]
*  Some giant fucking... [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1015.0s)]
*  Those LTDs or whatever? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1016.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1018.0s)]
*  Some big-ass stupid fucking car just cracked her. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1019.0s)]
*  So, this is an ORCA attack in Portugal. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1023.0s)]
*  So, they started doing this. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1026.0s)]
*  They say the bow suddenly, something hit us. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1027.0s)]
*  So, this is from 2021. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1030.0s)]
*  But what I'm talking about is very recently. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1034.0s)]
*  Yeah, this was in the article that was explaining it. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1036.0s)]
*  This is just an example of it, like the content. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1039.0s)]
*  So, it's happening quite a bit off the Iberian coast. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1041.0s)]
*  The Iberian ORCA has taught at least nine other whales to attack and destroy rudders. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1044.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1049.0s)]
*  So, it's like a Middle Eastern thing? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1050.0s)]
*  I just think it's a thing with a particular area where the ORCAs in that particular area [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1052.0s)]
*  have had problems with people. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1057.0s)]
*  I see. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1058.0s)]
*  And so, they've decided to let them know who the fuck is the boss. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1059.0s)]
*  Take action. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1062.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're fucking up people's boats. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1063.0s)]
*  It's hard to tell what's happening in the video, but they explain... [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1064.0s)]
*  Bro, I'd bring fish. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1066.0s)]
*  I'd be like, I'm not that dude. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1067.0s)]
*  I'm your friend. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1068.0s)]
*  Here's a mackerel. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1069.0s)]
*  Here's a mackerel. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1070.0s)]
*  Here's a can of tuna. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1071.0s)]
*  I would bring them. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1072.0s)]
*  Yeah, but they might be a little upset about the can. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1073.0s)]
*  I'd put it on a plate. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1075.0s)]
*  I'd plate it for them. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1076.0s)]
*  I don't think they like plates either. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1077.0s)]
*  Oh, that's a good point, huh? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1079.0s)]
*  An actual full mackerel is the way to go. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1080.0s)]
*  You know, a tuna is just for us. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1083.0s)]
*  Like, tuna fish in a can. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1084.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1086.0s)]
*  Isn't it weird that that one fish we decided to just fucking can up all the time? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1087.0s)]
*  Like, turn into sandwiches, everything. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1092.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1094.0s)]
*  Like, tuna salad, tuna this, tuna that, it's all tuna. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1095.0s)]
*  Yeah, tuna really got the... [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1097.0s)]
*  It's gotten the brunt of it, huh? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1099.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1100.0s)]
*  I bet other fish are like, ugh. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1101.0s)]
*  Thank God we're not tuna. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1102.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1103.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1104.0s)]
*  I mean, they're like the most canned fish ever. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1105.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1107.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1108.0s)]
*  They can some salmon. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1109.0s)]
*  Yeah, but canned salmon I think is a little pricier too. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1110.0s)]
*  Much more. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1114.0s)]
*  There's a really good company, I forget what the company's called, but they do wild caught. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1115.0s)]
*  They all do line caught salmon. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1119.0s)]
*  So you're getting wild salmon, not raised, and then they can it. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1121.0s)]
*  Mm. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1124.0s)]
*  Which was real good for you. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1125.0s)]
*  My sister used to have a bass that was in their house, and it was like, it couldn't even turn around in the tank. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1126.0s)]
*  Oh, that's fucked up. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1133.0s)]
*  I don't think it minded. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1134.0s)]
*  I bet it did. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1135.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1136.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1137.0s)]
*  Of course it did. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1138.0s)]
*  It lived there for a long time. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1139.0s)]
*  That's what they say to guys in solitary. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1140.0s)]
*  I don't think he minds. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1141.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it's true. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1142.0s)]
*  It's by himself in there. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1143.0s)]
*  Especially if it's a bass, he can't talk to him. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1144.0s)]
*  You know, he's probably like, get me the fuck out of here. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1147.0s)]
*  I want to be in a lake. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1150.0s)]
*  I want to be eating frogs, you cunt. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1151.0s)]
*  He's just watching cops out of one eye with my sister. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1153.0s)]
*  He's watching 90 Day Fiance. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1156.0s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with people? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1159.0s)]
*  Keep me in this goddamn bowl. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1161.0s)]
*  I'm a bass. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1163.0s)]
*  Stupid fuck. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1164.0s)]
*  I used to have piranhas. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1165.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course you did, man. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1166.0s)]
*  Who doesn't think you did? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1168.0s)]
*  I had this one house that I lived in when I was living by myself. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1169.0s)]
*  There was like an indoor courtyard to this house. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1174.0s)]
*  And I literally actually consulted construction people. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1178.0s)]
*  I was going to create like a miniature Jurassic Park in this courtyard. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1182.0s)]
*  I was going to seal it off and put crocodile monitors in. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1186.0s)]
*  And watch them kill it? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1191.0s)]
*  And watch them kill it, yeah. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1192.0s)]
*  But then I had like a come to Jesus moment. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1193.0s)]
*  Like, what the fuck is wrong with you? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1195.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1197.0s)]
*  Why do you want to do that? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1198.0s)]
*  Well, I think it would be, I would like to have a small something like that, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1199.0s)]
*  maybe in the home, you know? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1203.0s)]
*  I did like to have in the piranhas. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1205.0s)]
*  And was that where you, and were you, was that like a goal of yours? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1207.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it was a goal of yours. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1213.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it was a goal of yours. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1215.0s)]
*  Or were you, was that like a goal of yours, do you think? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1217.0s)]
*  Or were you just like, okay, this is my first place. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1221.0s)]
*  I want to design it how I want. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1223.0s)]
*  Or were you just, because that's a big thing to think about. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1225.0s)]
*  It was my first getting money. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1227.0s)]
*  First thing I got with money, I got a nice car. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1230.0s)]
*  I'm like, ooh, got a nice car now. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1232.0s)]
*  And then I was like, what other shit can I have? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1234.0s)]
*  I didn't have any responsibilities back then. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1236.0s)]
*  I was 27, free, free as a bird. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1238.0s)]
*  And I just was buying stupid shit, you know? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1242.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to go to the pit bulls. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1246.0s)]
*  Dang, bro, that's sick, man. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1248.0s)]
*  They were great dogs, though. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1250.0s)]
*  They're the best dogs, man. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1252.0s)]
*  Well, I don't say that. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1254.0s)]
*  My dog is the best dog. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1255.0s)]
*  The Golden Retriever, they're the best pet ever. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1257.0s)]
*  They're just so full of love. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1260.0s)]
*  But there's something about pit bulls, man. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1262.0s)]
*  They're just so loyal. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1264.0s)]
*  They love you so much. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1267.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1268.0s)]
*  You think more than a different type of dog? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1269.0s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1271.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1273.0s)]
*  I wish we could tell how much dogs love us or not, you know? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1274.0s)]
*  My dog is so domesticated. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1277.0s)]
*  He's so sweet. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1280.0s)]
*  And he's not remotely threatening to anybody. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1282.0s)]
*  Anybody who comes over the house, you're my best friend. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1285.0s)]
*  If you come over my house tonight, he'd be like, Theo! [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1288.0s)]
*  He'd be so happy. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1291.0s)]
*  He'd be whining and running around you in circles. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1292.0s)]
*  He just loves everybody. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1295.0s)]
*  But pit bulls are like, they just have so much more tenacity. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1297.0s)]
*  They're so angry. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1303.0s)]
*  They're just so full of fucking just raw. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1304.0s)]
*  And they just want to play and just want to kiss you. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1307.0s)]
*  And they're so full of life. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1309.0s)]
*  Yeah, they'll fucking hug you till you're dead, too. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1311.0s)]
*  When I would come home from work, my dogs would literally just jump on me. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1313.0s)]
*  Just jump on me. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1319.0s)]
*  I would lay on the ground. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1320.0s)]
*  They would just swarm me and kiss me. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1321.0s)]
*  They almost have ground game a little bit, huh? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1323.0s)]
*  They got a little ground game. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1325.0s)]
*  I used to teach them. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1326.0s)]
*  I'd get side control on them. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1327.0s)]
*  I'd teach them how to hipposcape. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1328.0s)]
*  I'd be like, bro, you got to put your paw here. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1329.0s)]
*  You got to create space. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1331.0s)]
*  I'd get him in a rear-necked choke. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1333.0s)]
*  I'd take his back. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1336.0s)]
*  He loved it. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1338.0s)]
*  Dude, my friend, when I was working, when I was in the busboy industry a long time ago, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1339.0s)]
*  and the first gay I ever met, the first gay dude I ever met, this dude Billy Conforto. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1346.0s)]
*  How old were you? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1353.0s)]
*  I was probably 14. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1354.0s)]
*  That was the first gay you ever met? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1356.0s)]
*  Yeah, that I ever met straight on. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1357.0s)]
*  Was he 14 too? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1360.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1361.0s)]
*  He was probably 30. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1362.0s)]
*  He was the toughest gay dude, so he could fight, and he was gay. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1363.0s)]
*  Nobody had ever seen it. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1370.0s)]
*  That's scary for a homophobe. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1372.0s)]
*  Oh, totally. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1374.0s)]
*  Some dude will fuck you up and suck your dick. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1375.0s)]
*  That's the biggest fear. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1377.0s)]
*  Or make you suck his. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1378.0s)]
*  That's the crazy part. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1379.0s)]
*  With no teeth. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1380.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1381.0s)]
*  He punches all your teeth out. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1382.0s)]
*  That's got to be crazy. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1384.0s)]
*  So that changed the game for a lot of homophobes because of like, who's this queer, you know? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1386.0s)]
*  And then you're like, oh, if that dude knocks me out and then makes love to me, it's going [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1391.0s)]
*  to be an 0 for 2 tonight. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1395.0s)]
*  That's more than two points. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1397.0s)]
*  That's like a 10-8 round. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1399.0s)]
*  But Billy had pipples, and he's so weed and everything, and we'd get so high, and then [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1403.0s)]
*  I would get so scared of the dogs, man, that I had to go outside a lot of times. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1408.0s)]
*  Because I couldn't, he was like more, he'd be a lot more comfortable around him and stuff, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1412.0s)]
*  but I would get high, and then I would just get scared around the dogs. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1416.0s)]
*  What's the dog that can kill you? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1420.0s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1422.0s)]
*  It's like they're real sweet and everything, and if you get a good one, you train them [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1423.0s)]
*  right and raise them right. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1427.0s)]
*  They're so loyal and they're so affectionate, but the power that they have is so wild. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1428.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Billy would put on like an Adidas tracksuit and make him like attack things [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1434.0s)]
*  in his yard and shit. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1438.0s)]
*  So he was training them to be like that. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1440.0s)]
*  He was, but he also loved them, but he also was from a tough area, so there was a value [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1442.0s)]
*  in having the dogs be tough. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1447.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of people that have that. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1449.0s)]
*  They have dogs that are just protection around their house all the time. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1451.0s)]
*  If you live in a rough area, there's no better thing than dogs. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1455.0s)]
*  They let you know when people are there, everyone's scared of them. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1457.0s)]
*  They'd rather break into a house that doesn't have dogs. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1460.0s)]
*  Oh, a lot of people, if they didn't have a dad, they would have a dog. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1464.0s)]
*  I guess. Yeah. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1469.0s)]
*  Yeah. If you're young. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1470.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have a few dogs. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1471.0s)]
*  The wife would get a dog a lot of times if they didn't have a husband, I remember, but [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1472.0s)]
*  there was a lot of dangerous dogs in my neighborhood growing up. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1476.0s)]
*  The problem is when they get loose. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1479.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1480.0s)]
*  When you have dangerous dogs, you don't do a good job of containing them. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1481.0s)]
*  I was always worried about my dog getting out. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1485.0s)]
*  My dog, Frank Sinatra, he was a pit bull that was bred for hog hunting in Hawaii. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1487.0s)]
*  They breed them different and they breed them. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1496.0s)]
*  They actually have longer ears. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1499.0s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1500.0s)]
*  They're almost like Labrador ears because the whole idea is that they're picking up scent. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1501.0s)]
*  Dogs pick up scent with their ears. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1505.0s)]
*  That's why bloodhounds have those crazy long ears. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1507.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1510.0s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1511.0s)]
*  As they're running, it's like, you know how you fart and you like waft up the smell. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1512.0s)]
*  Oh, what is that? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1515.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1516.0s)]
*  Well, dogs are doing that with their ears as they're running. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1517.0s)]
*  They're wafting up these scents. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1521.0s)]
*  So they could pick up little minuscule particles of scents as they're wafting up. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1523.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1527.0s)]
*  My pit bull had longer ears. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1528.0s)]
*  He had ears almost like a Labrador, but he was a pure pit bull. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1530.0s)]
*  Big fucking head, just jacked body. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1533.0s)]
*  Dogs that were loose would come to the fence and fuck with him. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1536.0s)]
*  He would go crazy. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1542.0s)]
*  He just couldn't get to them and they would be fucking with him. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1544.0s)]
*  One dog, pissed on his fence, just lifted his leg. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1547.0s)]
*  A Labrador. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1551.0s)]
*  Came by pissed on his fence. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1552.0s)]
*  So he started slamming his head into the metal bars. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1554.0s)]
*  His wrought iron metal bars. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1558.0s)]
*  He slams his head into the bars. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1560.0s)]
*  He's mostly head, right? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1562.0s)]
*  Pit bulls are like 50% head. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1564.0s)]
*  He's just like fucking... [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1566.0s)]
*  He gets his fucking head through. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1572.0s)]
*  I hear all this noise and I'm alone in the house. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1574.0s)]
*  I hear this noise and I look out the window and I see Frank with his head [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1578.0s)]
*  wedged between the bars and I see this dog right outside the gate that was pissing. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1582.0s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, he's going to get out. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1587.0s)]
*  So I run up to the fence and I get to him right when his ass pops through. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1590.0s)]
*  He bent the bars and he got out. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1596.0s)]
*  So it's me running down the street in my socks chasing this dog. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1599.0s)]
*  Fucking Andy Du Frank, baby. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1604.0s)]
*  He plowed this dog right into a pile of trash cans. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1606.0s)]
*  Right in my neighbor's trash cans and I got a hold of his collar right before it got ugly. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1609.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh the fucker. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1613.0s)]
*  So then I had to have another bar welded all around the perimeter of my fence [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1615.0s)]
*  to keep him from separating the bars. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1620.0s)]
*  So this Israeli dude came over here and he was the welder guy. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1623.0s)]
*  The fence guy. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1627.0s)]
*  He's like, what happened to your fence? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1629.0s)]
*  And I said, the dog did it. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1631.0s)]
*  He goes, this fucking fence. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1633.0s)]
*  This dog bent this fucking fence with his head? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1636.0s)]
*  I go, yeah, the dog peed out there. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1638.0s)]
*  He goes, bro. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1640.0s)]
*  I go, yeah, that's a crazy dog. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1642.0s)]
*  It's a different kind of dog. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1644.0s)]
*  Oh, that's Mike Perry, dude. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1646.0s)]
*  That's a different kind of dog. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1648.0s)]
*  They don't care about pain. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1650.0s)]
*  Pain doesn't mean a fucking thing to them. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1652.0s)]
*  They just want to get you. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1655.0s)]
*  They just want to get out. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1657.0s)]
*  I think the dog was being friendly. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1659.0s)]
*  Like, oh, smell my pee. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1662.0s)]
*  You know, he's a Labrador. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1664.0s)]
*  Right, he's just like, I'll piss over here. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1666.0s)]
*  He's in a frat. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1668.0s)]
*  He's like, oh, I'm a cig-a. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1670.0s)]
*  Probably didn't even know what a pit bull was. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1672.0s)]
*  This dog's a lot louder than me. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1674.0s)]
*  What's going on over here? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1676.0s)]
*  Oh, God, that dog's wearing a... [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1678.0s)]
*  That dog has a chain. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1680.0s)]
*  I had this one neighbor that had a dog that he never trained. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1682.0s)]
*  I mean, at all. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1684.0s)]
*  It was basically a wild dog that he fed. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1686.0s)]
*  It was a boxer. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1688.0s)]
*  And this dog wouldn't listen to anybody. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1690.0s)]
*  Like, if they left the screen, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1692.0s)]
*  so they left the door open, the dog would just fly through the screen, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1694.0s)]
*  just burst through the screen and go out. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1697.0s)]
*  And then he would come home when he was ready. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1699.0s)]
*  He just had his own plan or whatever? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1701.0s)]
*  They were just idiots. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1704.0s)]
*  They were really frustrated. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1706.0s)]
*  Look at this dog. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1708.0s)]
*  Is that a pit bull, too? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1710.0s)]
*  Yeah, look at him. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1712.0s)]
*  That's what my dog did. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1714.0s)]
*  It bent the bars, man. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1716.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're a different kind of animal. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1718.0s)]
*  You've got to really make sure that your perimeter is secure [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1720.0s)]
*  with a dog like that. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1723.0s)]
*  But this dog was not a dangerous dog. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1725.0s)]
*  It was just a little boxer. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1727.0s)]
*  I think Ida's got so... [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1729.0s)]
*  I think just, like, I would be so nervous around them. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1731.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1734.0s)]
*  But you should be if they're not trained well. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1736.0s)]
*  And we didn't grow up around any dogs. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1738.0s)]
*  Except for dogs that were in our neighborhood. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1740.0s)]
*  And they were more violent animals. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1742.0s)]
*  We didn't have any dogs in our home [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1744.0s)]
*  or any experience around dogs. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1746.0s)]
*  I remember the first time I ever even met an indoor dog. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1748.0s)]
*  I didn't know what dog could even be indoors, right? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1752.0s)]
*  And I was at my buddy Scott's house, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1755.0s)]
*  and they had a golden retriever. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1757.0s)]
*  And this bitch came around the corner, dude, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1760.0s)]
*  and I was like, who in the fuck is that? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1763.0s)]
*  I mean, it was like the most beautiful thing. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1765.0s)]
*  I mean, it was just like... [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1767.0s)]
*  Fluffy and gorgeous. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1769.0s)]
*  Fucking long blonde hair. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1771.0s)]
*  It was like Suzanne Somers. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1773.0s)]
*  It was like Suzanne Somers, dude, just coming... [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1775.0s)]
*  And I was like, damn, that thing is fucking fine, you know? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1777.0s)]
*  Suzanne Somers. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1780.0s)]
*  I had just never seen a dog look like they had gotten a good night's sleep. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1782.0s)]
*  You remember Suzanne Somers with the Thighmaster? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1785.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1787.0s)]
*  All she had was this spring that just tightened up your pussy muscle? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1789.0s)]
*  Because that's what you're doing. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1792.0s)]
*  Like, there's a lot of... [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1794.0s)]
*  Like, it's not squatting for your butt, it's not lunges. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1796.0s)]
*  You're just tightening up them pussy muscles. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1798.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1800.0s)]
*  So you're going to squeeze that dick, squeeze that dick, squeeze that dick. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1802.0s)]
*  It's like a glee by the time you get done with it, dude. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1804.0s)]
*  See if you can find the ad for the Thighmaster. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1806.0s)]
*  A lot of ladies bought that, too, because they wanted it to look like Suzanne Somers. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1809.0s)]
*  Look, it's just a spring. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1812.0s)]
*  She's still looking good. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1814.0s)]
*  She's like 1,000 years old. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1816.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, she still looks really good in my head. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1818.0s)]
*  One of the biggest blunders in all of television, though. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1821.0s)]
*  Her and Three's Company. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1823.0s)]
*  Three's Company, too. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1825.0s)]
*  That was a great show. What happened to it? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1827.0s)]
*  Well, crazy negotiations. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1829.0s)]
*  She wanted more money, she was demanding more money because she had become a giant star. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1831.0s)]
*  And so they basically relegated her to, she wasn't even on the show anymore. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1833.0s)]
*  There was one episode where she made a phone call and she called them. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1838.0s)]
*  She was on vacation. That was her in the episode. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1844.0s)]
*  Her in some totally different location calling them on the phone. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1846.0s)]
*  And then they eventually replaced her. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1850.0s)]
*  Yeah, I remember they got a new woman. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1852.0s)]
*  I think it was like, you know, she got an aggressive agent. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1854.0s)]
*  It might have been a husband, one of those deals. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1857.0s)]
*  I was like, I got this. I'm going to fucking you deserve more money. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1860.0s)]
*  It's just like what happened with Call Her Daddy. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1864.0s)]
*  That's a similar situation. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1867.0s)]
*  You know, the Call Her Daddy podcast. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1869.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. Alex. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1871.0s)]
*  What's her name? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1873.0s)]
*  Alex Cooper. Yeah, her name was. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1875.0s)]
*  She had a co-host. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1877.0s)]
*  Right. And the co-host had a boyfriend who was an agent. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1879.0s)]
*  Something Franklin. Sophia Franklin. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1881.0s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1883.0s)]
*  And then Portnoy told us the whole story. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1885.0s)]
*  Oh, he did? Yeah, it was like the dude thought that like she's going to be this. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1887.0s)]
*  She's a fucking star. You need to pay her more. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1891.0s)]
*  And like, you know, they had a deal. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1893.0s)]
*  The deal's a deal. She wanted more. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1895.0s)]
*  And then there was negotiations and her husband. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1897.0s)]
*  Yeah. So her husband, former television producer Alan Hamill, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1901.0s)]
*  went to negotiate for asking for one hundred fifty thousand dollars a week, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1904.0s)]
*  which was the average that men were earning on television at the time. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1908.0s)]
*  OK, it's not television. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1911.0s)]
*  That's like saying, well, brain surgeons make this. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1913.0s)]
*  I'm a plumber, so I deserve it. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1916.0s)]
*  And on par with what her co-star Ritter was making, John Ritter, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1918.0s)]
*  she said she didn't know at the time that Ritter was making more [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1922.0s)]
*  since the three of them had a favored nations clause. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1925.0s)]
*  What does that mean again? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1929.0s)]
*  Favored nations, I think is like chair. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1931.0s)]
*  What is it? It's in. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1933.0s)]
*  I thought that means you all make the same amount. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1935.0s)]
*  Is that what it means? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1937.0s)]
*  No, I think it's a it's a Inuit thing, isn't it? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1939.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. That's First Nation. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1943.0s)]
*  MFN provision is a term included in a contract for products or services [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1947.0s)]
*  that prevents the seller from selling its products or services [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1952.0s)]
*  to the buyer's competitors for a lower price or on better terms. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1955.0s)]
*  Oh, I thought this was a chalk tall dude. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1960.0s)]
*  I didn't know what they were talking about. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1963.0s)]
*  Favored Nations contract. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1965.0s)]
*  I want what she's getting favored nations. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1971.0s)]
*  You know, agents will ruin a lot of stuff. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1974.0s)]
*  Oh, God. Yeah. It's unfortunate, huh? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1977.0s)]
*  Yeah. Omnipresent and entertainment contracts certainly is fair. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1979.0s)]
*  The post-exposure to the favorite nations clause are relatively simple to describe. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1983.0s)]
*  They're contractual commitment that no other relevant party will receive [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1987.0s)]
*  better or more advantageous terms from the party making the commitment. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1990.0s)]
*  That makes sense. So like so if you and I were doing a show, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1995.0s)]
*  we would have a favorite nations deal where we both make the exact [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=1997.0s)]
*  the same amount of money, which is fair. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2000.0s)]
*  So I care. She probably didn't know that he was getting paid [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2002.0s)]
*  because John Ritter was a giant star at the time. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2005.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that is. Oh, yeah. John Ritter. Yeah. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2007.0s)]
*  John Ritter. He was incredible. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2010.0s)]
*  He did an episode of News Radio. Did he really? Yeah. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2012.0s)]
*  Yeah. He was cool, man. So that was them back in the day, man. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2016.0s)]
*  It was a great fucking show. He was so talented. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2019.0s)]
*  The fucking some guy ruined it. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2021.0s)]
*  Didn't he do Noises Off that movie, too? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2023.0s)]
*  What was that? Noises Off? I don't know what that is. Is that a deaf movie? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2027.0s)]
*  I don't know, dude. I'll tell you this. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2030.0s)]
*  One time I was walking down the street in New York and they had a deaf group [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2032.0s)]
*  or whatever, like a gaggle or whatever. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2035.0s)]
*  I don't know what it's called, but they got together [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2038.0s)]
*  and they were outside of a bar talking and I'm walking up [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2040.0s)]
*  and I'm like, I thought maybe like the world had like shut off [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2043.0s)]
*  or something I couldn't hear because I'm seeing all these people [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2046.0s)]
*  interacting, but nobody was there was no sound. Oh. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2048.0s)]
*  And I get close and hear this Noises Off. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2051.0s)]
*  Never seen this. I don't even. What is Noises Off? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2055.0s)]
*  I do recognize that scene with Christopher Reeves. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2057.0s)]
*  I thought John Ritter was in there. Yeah, he is. He is. He is. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2060.0s)]
*  Yes. I'm doing a theatrical play, but it's a movie. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2062.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a movie. It's like one shot. It never ends or something. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2066.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. OK. But. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2070.0s)]
*  But. Is it good? Yeah. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2074.0s)]
*  Something to check out. It's an old movie. Yeah. He was a real sweet guy. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2079.0s)]
*  He was real. Everybody loved him. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2082.0s)]
*  He was on the set of news radio for a week and just a super nice guy. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2084.0s)]
*  Like there's sometimes you meet people and you hope they're going to be nice [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2088.0s)]
*  because they're nice on TV, you know, but they're not. Yeah. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2092.0s)]
*  And it's really frustrating. It's weird. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2095.0s)]
*  Like they're creepy to you or they're shitty to you because you're an actor [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2097.0s)]
*  and you're like, oh, wow, you're kind of a cunt. You're a fake. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2100.0s)]
*  You're faking it for television. But in real life, you're like this weird, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2103.0s)]
*  snipey sort of shitty fucking insulting person. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2106.0s)]
*  I met a few of those, too. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2111.0s)]
*  It's very frustrating because you're like, I thought you were nice. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2114.0s)]
*  I saw you on TV. You're nice. Just trying to say hi. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2117.0s)]
*  And you're fucking cunt to me. Yeah. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2119.0s)]
*  Yeah, we were supposed to Michael Landon was supposed to come to our town. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2122.0s)]
*  No, it wasn't Aquaman, the man from Atlantis. Was he? Yeah. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2126.0s)]
*  I didn't see that. Was he on Little House in the Prairie? Yeah. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2130.0s)]
*  I think he was on The Man from Atlantis, too, wasn't he? Good boy. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2133.0s)]
*  I remember everybody was swim like the man from Atlantis when I was a kid. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2136.0s)]
*  He swam like this because he swam like almost like a dolphin. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2139.0s)]
*  He didn't swim like a person. Well, dude, you have to think the first one. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2143.0s)]
*  No, who was it? Who was the man from Atlantis? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2147.0s)]
*  Who was the the main actor? Patrick Duffy. That's right. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2151.0s)]
*  I can fuse those two. Well, Joe, you have to think probably the first people. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2156.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. That dude. You ever saw this man from Atlantis? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2159.0s)]
*  Yeah, that guy's got a hard drive. Who's that? Investigated. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2162.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was that was the man from Atlantis. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2168.0s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah, it was like a big show. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2170.0s)]
*  Well, this is like 77 and 1978. Jesus Christ. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2173.0s)]
*  Only one year. It was a big show. All right. It was you. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2176.0s)]
*  Yeah, Joe, I think you just like this show for some reason. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2179.0s)]
*  He would swim real funny, man. See if you could find man from Atlantis swimming [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2183.0s)]
*  because he would swim in this like weird way. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2188.0s)]
*  And so when I was a kid, me and my friends, when we go swimming, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2191.0s)]
*  we would fucking copy the man from Atlantis. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2194.0s)]
*  He had a very you can I still swim like that to this day sometimes. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2198.0s)]
*  I don't think you did. Like that. See how he swims? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2201.0s)]
*  What? Nobody swims like that. He swim like a fish, man. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2205.0s)]
*  Watch, bro. But look how fast he swims. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2209.0s)]
*  Nobody could fuck with him. He swim like a dolphin. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2212.0s)]
*  That's impossible. This is stupid. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2215.0s)]
*  I think he jumped up. You grab a fish. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2217.0s)]
*  Yeah, he jumped up better than the dolphin did. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2220.0s)]
*  Totally made sense. This is all bro. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2223.0s)]
*  He's from he's touching her tit. What's going on there? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2226.0s)]
*  He had web fingers. Oh, he did. Yeah. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2228.0s)]
*  Web fingers. Oh, I'd hate that. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2230.0s)]
*  Did he talk? Good if you were swimming. Yeah, he talked. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2232.0s)]
*  Yeah. But trying to get a mitten on would just fucking. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2234.0s)]
*  That would suck. God, it would be easy. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2236.0s)]
*  The glove would be the real problem. Yeah, you're right. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2239.0s)]
*  Yeah, mitten would be great. Mitten's are really the move, man. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2242.0s)]
*  Unless you take your fucking glove off, you need to use your fingers. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2245.0s)]
*  Like how good are your fingers working when you have a glove on? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2248.0s)]
*  Very bad. Yeah. But mittens, your shit stays warm. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2251.0s)]
*  Oh, all them little fingers, nuzzling up against each other. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2255.0s)]
*  Keeping each other warm. Yeah. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2258.0s)]
*  I'll even pull the I'll open the end and be like, y'all have fun. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2260.0s)]
*  Yeah, because they're having a blast. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2263.0s)]
*  Having a good time in there. It's a warm party. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2266.0s)]
*  Dude, that's why sometimes I think like I would hate to have like one of those long wieners. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2269.0s)]
*  Like, what were we looking at? The elk? Yeah. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2274.0s)]
*  Because you keep going back to that. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2276.0s)]
*  Well, you have to think, though, while I was trying to figure out what our conversation was we were talking about. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2278.0s)]
*  But think how much wiener isn't in the recipient. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2283.0s)]
*  Right. There's a certain amount of dick that is a problem. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2289.0s)]
*  Like if you have a 12 inch dick. You're an idiot. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2292.0s)]
*  How many people how many people can enjoy that 12 inch dick? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2295.0s)]
*  Like how many girl probably more guys can take it. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2301.0s)]
*  You probably might have to go gay because guys can take some preposterous dick. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2303.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's a duck dick. Ducks have the craziest dick. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2307.0s)]
*  What ducks have dicks that are as long as their body. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2310.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. Corkscrew. Well, ducks are rapists, by the way. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2314.0s)]
*  And the female duck does not want that. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2318.0s)]
*  So the female duck's vagina is not like a straight shot. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2321.0s)]
*  It's like a fucking labranath. You got to find your way through the passage and that and it's got spikes on it. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2324.0s)]
*  See the little spikes all over the duck. Yeah. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2330.0s)]
*  Yeah. Duck ducks are horrible. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2332.0s)]
*  They when they get a female duck, they rape them. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2335.0s)]
*  They bite them and then they just fucking. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2338.0s)]
*  And so the female duck can allow the male duck in or not in. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2341.0s)]
*  She can stop the process of it. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2346.0s)]
*  That's why they have these corkscrew dicks like nature has invented. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2348.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking like we're trying to get your hand into a vending machine. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2352.0s)]
*  I look at the duck vagina and look at the duck dick. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2356.0s)]
*  So even the duck vagina is all curly and twisty. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2359.0s)]
*  It's not a straight shot. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2362.0s)]
*  So for the female to let the male and she has to want to breed, it seems like neither one of them wants to have sex with the other one. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2364.0s)]
*  They definitely do. But the way they do is awful. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2371.0s)]
*  Like I've seen it at like like a pond. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2374.0s)]
*  It's like you just go, Jesus, I step in here. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2377.0s)]
*  Yeah, stop there. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2380.0s)]
*  You see that guy, guy got arrested because he helped a bison, a baby bison, and they wound up euthanizing it. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2383.0s)]
*  The mother wouldn't accept it, I guess. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2391.0s)]
*  There was a baby bison at Yellowstone and it was having a hard time crossing something. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2393.0s)]
*  And so the guy got out and helped it. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2397.0s)]
*  I didn't see. Yeah, that's it right there. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2400.0s)]
*  So look at that pervert. I look at him. He's a nice guy. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2402.0s)]
*  He was just trying to help the baby bison. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2405.0s)]
*  So because it was touched, I guess the female just didn't want it anymore because it had the scent of the guy, which is fucking weird. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2408.0s)]
*  The herd rejected it. What scent? Like Winston's? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2417.0s)]
*  Well, it smelled humans. Yeah, he's got fucking cheeseburgers. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2421.0s)]
*  For sure. Look at him. Winston's. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2425.0s)]
*  Camels. No filters. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2429.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2431.0s)]
*  He's really good. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2433.0s)]
*  What did he smell like? Fucking ABBA albums and fucking Paul Moss? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2435.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. It was on his fingers. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2439.0s)]
*  But no, I think I would hate that, man. If you had a long wiener, right? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2442.0s)]
*  Right. Think of how much wiener is not in there. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2445.0s)]
*  Yeah. And just like being in the cold, you know? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2448.0s)]
*  Your dick would get cold? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2451.0s)]
*  Well, I just think like you ever been in like a sleeping bag or whatever and your feet are hanging out the bottom? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2452.0s)]
*  Right. Your dick would be out in cold. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2456.0s)]
*  The base of your dick would be so lonely. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2458.0s)]
*  The base of your dick would get no attention. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2460.0s)]
*  Plus it would probably be annoying for a girl. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2463.0s)]
*  I like dick. What is this stupid fucking giant dick that hurts? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2466.0s)]
*  Yeah, this never ending dick. It's like watching a long movie, I bet. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2470.0s)]
*  You ever watch a porno where a girl is sucking a guy's dick and it's just ridiculous. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2473.0s)]
*  It's just like sucking this microphone. It's too big. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2478.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. That poor guy. The poor girl and poor guy. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2482.0s)]
*  They must both be frustrated. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2485.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like watching something. I don't know. A lot of it sometimes for me seems like... [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2487.0s)]
*  Man with world's biggest penis stuns host with explicit pick. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2492.0s)]
*  Philip and Josie react to the world's biggest penis. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2496.0s)]
*  13 and a half inches. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2499.0s)]
*  Whoa. His name is Jonah Fallon, New York actor. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2501.0s)]
*  Wow. Wow. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2506.0s)]
*  Let me see this dude. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2508.0s)]
*  I don't want that. I just... [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2510.0s)]
*  That's the guy? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2511.0s)]
*  Oh my God. That's Jonah? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2512.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2514.0s)]
*  See, that's the kind of dick that you have. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2515.0s)]
*  Ooh, look at that wand on him, homie. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2517.0s)]
*  That's a hog. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2519.0s)]
*  My God, boy. Dang, dude. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2520.0s)]
*  Imagine getting directions from that guy. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2523.0s)]
*  So he's showing it to them, scroll down. So there he shows it to them. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2525.0s)]
*  Oh, I'll set fire. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2529.0s)]
*  That's his hog. Look at her. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2531.0s)]
*  So now you don't have to compare it to these objects. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2533.0s)]
*  He just showed them his cock. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2537.0s)]
*  I think he's saying it's about as big as that thing. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2538.0s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. 13 and a half inches. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2540.0s)]
*  But who wants that? I just feel like if you had that much... I would just hate it. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2543.0s)]
*  And say if you're walking to the restroom or something, if you have a cat, that cat's going to attack that bitch every time. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2547.0s)]
*  Probably if you're naked. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2552.0s)]
*  No. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2553.0s)]
*  You're not a chance. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2554.0s)]
*  It's a dangling little cat toy. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2556.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. You have to basically hold your dick up like this when you walk over to the bathroom. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2559.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't walk around in it. Oh, that's like guys with inflated balls. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2564.0s)]
*  132 pound scrotum. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2568.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's just a disease though, right? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2570.0s)]
*  Yeah, but same problem that he's explaining. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2571.0s)]
*  But it's a much worse problem because it's a cancerous sack. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2573.0s)]
*  It's like my 300 pound inmate or whatever. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2577.0s)]
*  What makes their balls grow up that big? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2579.0s)]
*  What do they do about those, by the way? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2582.0s)]
*  Because more than one dude has had his balls... [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2584.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's called scrotal lymphedema. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2587.0s)]
*  Edema. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2589.0s)]
*  I don't think I want to look up pictures of this. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2590.0s)]
*  Yeah, you do. You definitely do. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2592.0s)]
*  But let's get some smell insults in the system first. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2594.0s)]
*  Oh, you want to? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2596.0s)]
*  Yeah. We're going to look up giant scrotums getting operated on. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2597.0s)]
*  Let's fire up. Oh, Jesus. Let's fire up. Let's fire up. Let's go. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2600.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2603.0s)]
*  You first. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2604.0s)]
*  Oh, man. I've been waiting for this. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2606.0s)]
*  Woo! He requested this, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2608.0s)]
*  Here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2610.0s)]
*  Take a sniff. Ready? Hit it. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2613.0s)]
*  Those are dead. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2616.0s)]

*  I thought it was going to be dead and it wasn't. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2632.0s)]
*  That must be our most recent one. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2634.0s)]

*  This guy did it to his eyes. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2669.0s)]
*  Why'd he do it to his eyes? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2670.0s)]
*  Maybe it. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2671.0s)]
*  He's trying to. Did he get rocked? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2672.0s)]
*  No, he's trying to wake up to go play probably. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2674.0s)]
*  He might have gotten rocked. I don't know. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2676.0s)]

*  One thing that. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2697.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's something about that. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2701.0s)]
*  People have an extra wiener that makes me angry. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2702.0s)]
*  Makes you angry like the world's not fair. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2705.0s)]
*  That's how flat chested girls feel when other girls walk by with giant tits. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2708.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2712.0s)]
*  That's a big one, right? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2713.0s)]
*  Because if you were just born with giant tits, you just hit the genetic lottery. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2714.0s)]
*  And every guy loves big tits. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2718.0s)]

*  They just want to squeeze them. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2723.0s)]
*  They just want to suck on them. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2724.0s)]
*  Some of them are so big though. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2725.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can get too big just like a dick. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2727.0s)]
*  And you're just like, God. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2729.0s)]
*  You could be like that Canadian teacher that teaches wood shop class with giant rubber tits on. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2730.0s)]
*  That shit is where woke where woke hits its final destination. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2739.0s)]
*  Dude, the bad, the crazy part is that guy looks like Tim Dillon if you just put a regular picture of him. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2743.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, because he's like not really trans. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2748.0s)]
*  It's a scam. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2750.0s)]

*  So it goes to his legs. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2769.0s)]
*  Oh, oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2771.0s)]
*  And what do they do to drain it? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2773.0s)]

*  Over the next nine months, every six days or so, he would experience what he felt like a sensational carpet burn in his groin, then severe cold and shaking, followed by his scrotum growing uncontrollably larger and larger. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2831.0s)]
*  Got so bad one day that I stood in my living room and cried. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2845.0s)]
*  He said there was a fresh breakage of the skin and it stung to know it. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2847.0s)]
*  Oh, man, he's getting fucking stretch marks on the ball sack. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2851.0s)]

*  And then you let a gerbil loose in there. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2949.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2956.0s)]
*  Nothing happens, but she keeps thinking the wiener's going to get the little, get that gerbil baby. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2957.0s)]
*  He's on the wrong website making money. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2963.0s)]
*  I just looked at him. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2964.0s)]
*  He's got a cameo, but he's definitely been an OnlyFans, right? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2965.0s)]
*  Maybe he doesn't want people to see his dick. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2967.0s)]
*  He's still an actor. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2969.0s)]
*  You know, maybe he's like still trying to make it out in that world. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2971.0s)]
*  That's the hardest world to make it in, man. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2974.0s)]
*  In acting? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2976.0s)]
*  Oh, because they don't have to pick you. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2977.0s)]
*  You could be amazing and some shitty casting agent, some shitty director. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2980.0s)]
*  They might not like you. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2984.0s)]
*  They might. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2985.0s)]
*  You might remind them of an ex-boyfriend. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2986.0s)]
*  They might think you're too confident or they might be playing power trip games. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2988.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2992.0s)]
*  There's too much. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2993.0s)]
*  And there's an all in nepotism, too. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2994.0s)]
*  It seems like in that industry. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2995.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2997.0s)]
*  It's a lot of like you see so many people get opportunities where you're like, man, did that person really or was there were opportunities where they're like, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=2998.0s)]
*  opportunities where their family was involved, you know? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3006.0s)]
*  It's family involved, but in more cases, it's networking. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3008.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3012.0s)]
*  It's like they go, they, I dated a girl who was an actress when I first came here and she always was networking. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3013.0s)]
*  It's like, I have to go to this party. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3018.0s)]
*  I have to meet these people. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3020.0s)]
*  I have to know these casting people. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3021.0s)]
*  I have to know these. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3022.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, and she would go around them and be so fake. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3023.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3026.0s)]
*  I love your dress. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3027.0s)]
*  Like that kind of shit. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3028.0s)]
*  And you're like, oh, it's exhausting. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3029.0s)]
*  Because it's one thing if someone's like super complimentary. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3031.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3034.0s)]
*  I have nothing to gain for it. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3035.0s)]
*  Like, dude, I love your shoes. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3036.0s)]
*  Where'd you get those? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3037.0s)]
*  And you know, it's pure. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3038.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3039.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3040.0s)]
*  Like, oh, thanks, man. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3041.0s)]
*  I like your hat. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3042.0s)]
*  I like your arms or whatever. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3043.0s)]
*  If someone's complimentary of you. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3044.0s)]
*  Look at you, handsome motherfucker. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3045.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3046.0s)]
*  It's nice. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3047.0s)]
*  It's complimentary for no reason. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3048.0s)]
*  But there's something gross about when you know someone that I know this girl. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3050.0s)]
*  This is not how she is. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3056.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3058.0s)]
*  She's kissing everybody's ass just to just appear nicer. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3059.0s)]
*  Like, maybe they'll think about her when a role comes up. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3062.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3065.0s)]
*  And so that forms their opinions on things, too, because that forms their political opinions, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3066.0s)]
*  because they find out what the political opinions of the casting people and the executives, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3071.0s)]
*  which is always left leaning. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3075.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3076.0s)]
*  Unless you're on Yellowstone, you know, you better, you know, you better be wearing a fucking pride flag or something. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3077.0s)]
*  Like, you have to, like, be 100 percent progressive, liberal leaning, left leaning. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3083.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3087.0s)]
*  And so these people alter their, they alter their opinions of the world based on what is going to get them closer to the honey pot. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3088.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3097.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3098.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3099.0s)]
*  I think it's amazing that all of Hollywood has the same political beliefs. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3100.0s)]
*  All. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3104.0s)]
*  Except Yellowstone, that Taylor Sheridan guy. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3105.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3108.0s)]
*  He seems like an interesting guy. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3109.0s)]
*  Have you met him? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3110.0s)]
*  No, I need, I've connected with him on text messages. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3111.0s)]
*  He's friends with Whitney. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3113.0s)]
*  But I admire that guy. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3114.0s)]
*  And his shows are fucking amazing. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3115.0s)]
*  People love him, dude. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3117.0s)]
*  Yeah. And his movies, too. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3118.0s)]
*  He made that. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3120.0s)]
*  What was that fucking movie? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3121.0s)]
*  The bank robbery movie with was Jeff Bridges in it? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3122.0s)]
*  God damn it. It's good. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3128.0s)]

*  I'm thinking of something. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3143.0s)]
*  Benicio del Toro. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3144.0s)]

*  He seems like a cool motherfucker. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3147.0s)]
*  Spanish people always seem cool, I think, because it's neat to say their name. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3148.0s)]
*  Benicio del Toro. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3153.0s)]

*  He was in the Johnny Depp movie about Hunter S. Thompson. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3160.0s)]
*  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3164.0s)]
*  That was the movie. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3166.0s)]
*  He played the attorney. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3167.0s)]
*  Oh, that was a great movie. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3168.0s)]
*  We can't stop here. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3169.0s)]
*  He played the attorney. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3170.0s)]
*  This is bad. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3171.0s)]
*  Yeah, there he is. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3172.0s)]
*  He got fat for that movie, too. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3173.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3174.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3175.0s)]
*  That was a fucking great movie. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3176.0s)]
*  That movie makes me want to do drugs. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3178.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3180.0s)]
*  Makes you want to do drugs and go to Vegas. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3181.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3183.0s)]
*  Fun fucking times. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3184.0s)]
*  Benicio del Toro. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3186.0s)]
*  He was also the werewolf. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3188.0s)]
*  Do you ever see him in The Wolfman? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3189.0s)]
*  Love. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3191.0s)]
*  You can see him looking in his eyes right there until he was. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3192.0s)]
*  He was good in The Wolfman. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3194.0s)]
*  The Wolfman was kind of a cornball movie. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3195.0s)]
*  It was like a combination of CGI and like real like Rick Baker style makeup, which is pretty cool. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3197.0s)]
*  The Wolfman? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3204.0s)]
*  He never saw it? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3205.0s)]
*  No. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3207.0s)]
*  Find the scene where Benicio del Toro transforms into the werewolf. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3208.0s)]
*  Because there's a scene when they've got him bolted down to a chair in an operating room. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3214.0s)]
*  Give me some volume on this. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3219.0s)]
*  Because these dudes, they think he's insane. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3221.0s)]
*  But he remains a perfectly ordinary human being. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3234.0s)]
*  He will have taken his first small step down the long road to mental recovery. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3239.0s)]
*  Now, we are all aware that this is good. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3247.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, this is good. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3249.0s)]
*  He has suffered quite traumatic personal experiences. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3250.0s)]
*  He witnessed his mother's self-mutilation. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3255.0s)]
*  His young mind, unable to accept it, created a fantastical truth. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3259.0s)]
*  That his father is to blame. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3265.0s)]
*  That his father is literally a monster. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3268.0s)]
*  That Nicolas Cage? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3277.0s)]
*  No. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3278.0s)]
*  Your father is not a werewolf. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3279.0s)]
*  You were not bitten by a werewolf. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3283.0s)]
*  You will not become a werewolf. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3286.0s)]
*  Any more than I will sprout wings and fly out of that window. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3290.0s)]
*  Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3295.0s)]
*  That's how they did medicine back then, in a theater. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3297.0s)]
*  Isn't that weird? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3300.0s)]
*  So they did operations. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3301.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3302.0s)]
*  Mr. Talbot has something to say to us. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3303.0s)]
*  No sedatives. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3306.0s)]
*  He's got something to say to them. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3310.0s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3315.0s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3316.0s)]
*  Speak up, Mr. Talbot. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3318.0s)]
*  Forgive me, but we can't hear you. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3320.0s)]
*  You moron. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3323.0s)]
*  Tonight I will kill all of you. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3326.0s)]
*  I will kill all of you. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3330.0s)]
*  Yes, well, as you can see, Lycanthroids is a disease-optimized, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3333.0s)]
*  existing somewhere in the deep... [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3343.0s)]
*  Kill me. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3347.0s)]
*  Uh oh. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3348.0s)]
*  For him, it seems very real. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3350.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3356.0s)]
*  Oh, that's badass. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3358.0s)]
*  It's a great scene. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3377.0s)]
*  The movie's eh, but this scene is fucking dope. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3379.0s)]
*  Dr. Hunnigan. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3385.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3400.0s)]
*  Oh, dang. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3425.0s)]
*  Look at that pervert, huh? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3441.0s)]
*  Is that David Spade? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3444.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3455.0s)]
*  That's crazy, man. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3472.0s)]
*  It's a good scene. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3474.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is really good. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3475.0s)]
*  But you see, he was like kind of half goofy. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3477.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3480.0s)]
*  It was like half a werewolf, half a fucking man, some CGI, like this is CGI. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3481.0s)]
*  It was good, though, I thought. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3489.0s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3492.0s)]
*  It looks really good. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3494.0s)]
*  What time period was this? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3495.0s)]
*  This was a few years ago. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3496.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3497.0s)]
*  This was like 2011, 2010. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3498.0s)]
*  Do you remember Swamp Thing? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3501.0s)]
*  Yeah, I forgot about Swamp Thing. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3502.0s)]
*  I used to read the comic books. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3504.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3505.0s)]
*  I never even knew what it was. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3506.0s)]
*  DC Comics, Swamp Thing. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3507.0s)]
*  Dude, in our area, people were so excited because it was Louisiana, you know, people [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3508.0s)]
*  were like, fuck yeah, dude, the swamp is back, you know? [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3512.0s)]
*  People were like, we got this, we can do it. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3515.0s)]
*  We could do it. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3517.0s)]
*  We're heroes now. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3518.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could see people's dads telling them, don't you want to be like Swamp Thing? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3519.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3523.0s)]
*  Yeah, like people were just... [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3524.0s)]
*  That was the big hero of Louisiana? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3525.0s)]
*  People were fired up. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3526.0s)]
*  There was a movie, Swamp Thing, wasn't there? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3527.0s)]
*  I'm Googling now, there's a bunch of recent stuff, but I can't tell how much of it's like... [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3529.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3533.0s)]
*  Yeah, here, I've been on YouTube. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3534.0s)]
*  That was the old movie. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3535.0s)]
*  That was the original movie. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3536.0s)]
*  It seems, it says four years ago, DC Universe Original. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3537.0s)]
*  Oh, I think that's animated. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3540.0s)]
*  That was the one, it looks like I think. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3541.0s)]
*  Wes Craven. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3543.0s)]
*  But I don't know if someone just typed his name in to get attention. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3544.0s)]
*  I think Wes Craven did direct the Swamp Thing. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3547.0s)]
*  Swamp Thing was good, though. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3550.0s)]
*  Not long ago, in the unexplored regions of an unmapped swamp, the creative genius of [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3552.0s)]
*  one man collided with another's evil dream, and a monster was born. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3557.0s)]
*  And Louisiana was back on the map. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3562.0s)]
*  Yeah, Wes Craven film. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3564.0s)]
*  Swamp Thing. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3565.0s)]
*  I like to dream of... [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3566.0s)]
*  Dun, dun, dun. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3568.0s)]
*  Why ride between the summer heat. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3569.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was gonna say, and Swamp Thing's just riding a truck. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3572.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3575.0s)]
*  I'm so proud. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3576.0s)]
*  Did you ever interview Willie Nelson? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3579.0s)]
*  Do you ever interview him? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3580.0s)]
*  No, I would love to interview Willie Nelson. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3581.0s)]
*  I don't think I interview people. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3583.0s)]
*  I think I just talk to them. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3585.0s)]
*  That's a good point, yes. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3586.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3587.0s)]
*  Did you ever just talk to Willie Nelson? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3588.0s)]
*  No, it's okay. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3589.0s)]
*  But I mean, people have said that, like about, I love your interview, and I'm always like, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3590.0s)]
*  eee, I mean, kinda, sorta. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3592.0s)]
*  It's really just a conversation. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3594.0s)]
*  Well, some people, I think, if you're curious on information from them, then you want to [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3596.0s)]
*  ask them more things, like, about that they know about that you don't know about. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3601.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3604.0s)]
*  Like, if I'm talking to Michio Kaku or, you know, a quantum physicist or something like [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3605.0s)]
*  that, I ask questions. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3610.0s)]
*  I'm essentially interviewing them. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3611.0s)]
*  And especially, it's something that I really have no understanding of. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3613.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3617.0s)]
*  Yeah, but for the most part, I'm just talking to people. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3618.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3620.0s)]
*  Which is, like, takes a lot of pressure off, too, because they're like, what subjects do [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3621.0s)]
*  you want to cover? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3624.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3625.0s)]
*  Let's just talk. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3626.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3627.0s)]
*  Some people weird it out by that, you know? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3628.0s)]
*  Like, you and I, it's like, we know each other so long, we don't have to talk about what [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3629.0s)]
*  we're going to talk about. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3632.0s)]
*  We just get in here and start rolling. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3633.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little easier, too. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3634.0s)]
*  I think it gets easier, too, when you've been in here before. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3635.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3638.0s)]
*  It's weird when you see people for the first time, and you see them lock up, and they're [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3639.0s)]
*  nervous. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3642.0s)]
*  And I'm always just like, I'm going to hold your hand, and we're going to get through [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3643.0s)]
*  this. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3647.0s)]
*  I'm going to get you 20 minutes in, and you're going to not even know you're here. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3648.0s)]
*  Have you had people that really locked up? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3651.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3653.0s)]
*  I've had people get real nervous, and you see them breathing funny, and they can't talk [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3654.0s)]
*  that good because they can't get breath, you know? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3658.0s)]
*  But it's okay. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3660.0s)]
*  I'm always just like, let's calm this thing down. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3662.0s)]
*  We're going to be all right. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3665.0s)]
*  It's pretty normal, I think, some people trying something new. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3666.0s)]
*  But it's just weird, the numbers. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3669.0s)]
*  That's what weirds people out, the numbers of humans. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3672.0s)]
*  That freaks people out. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3675.0s)]
*  It's hard to just be yourself in front of millions of people. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3677.0s)]
*  But you can. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3682.0s)]
*  And you do it, I do it, we do it. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3683.0s)]
*  You can just be yourself. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3685.0s)]
*  You are the same fucking dude if you and I are going having dinner somewhere, or if we're [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3686.0s)]
*  at a comedy club, or if we're here. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3691.0s)]
*  The same dude. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3693.0s)]
*  Some people can't do that. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3694.0s)]
*  They have to put on a persona when they're talking. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3695.0s)]
*  They get weirded out. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3700.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think sometimes that's interesting. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3702.0s)]
*  Do you find that when you're doing podcasts? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3705.0s)]
*  I find... [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3708.0s)]
*  I think sometimes I'm like, which me is kind of showing up more today? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3711.0s)]
*  That might sound a little fucking... [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3715.0s)]
*  Oh no, I know what you mean by that. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3717.0s)]
*  But am I a little agitated today? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3718.0s)]
*  Am I feeling goofy? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3721.0s)]
*  Am I having, kind of what's going on? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3722.0s)]
*  Am I a little curious today? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3724.0s)]
*  Am I a little inquisitive? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3726.0s)]
*  Just which part of me is kind of at the surface sometimes at the moment? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3729.0s)]
*  I had a revelation the other night that I forgot about. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3733.0s)]
*  I was on mushrooms. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3736.0s)]
*  And I closed my eyes and I realized that in certain circumstances, when I'm healthy, when [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3737.0s)]
*  everything's going great, I have a very specific frequency. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3747.0s)]
*  It's a different frequency. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3751.0s)]
*  And this weird revelation that I had while I was high showed me this. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3752.0s)]
*  It was almost like a lesson that I was learning. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3757.0s)]
*  And it was like, here's you now. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3759.0s)]
*  You're very healthy. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3762.0s)]
*  I had an IV vitamin drip that day. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3763.0s)]
*  I'd worked out. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3767.0s)]
*  I did the cold plunge. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3768.0s)]
*  I did the sauna. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3769.0s)]
*  No conflicts. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3770.0s)]
*  No problem in my personal life. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3771.0s)]
*  No problem in my business life. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3773.0s)]
*  Everything was beautiful. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3775.0s)]
*  And I had this like... [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3776.0s)]
*  And then it showed me there's times where you don't have that, where you're irritable, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3780.0s)]
*  where you're tired, where you're sick, where you're hurt. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3786.0s)]
*  There's all these different frequencies that you have. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3790.0s)]
*  And it made me realize like you think about your health and you think about like how you [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3793.0s)]
*  feel and whether or not you're present. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3798.0s)]
*  You think it is just like, it's better to just be this way. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3800.0s)]
*  But you don't realize that you're achieving a certain frequency. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3804.0s)]
*  I was achieving a certain frequency at that moment. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3806.0s)]
*  And I realized like this is attainable and this is what I should strive for. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3809.0s)]
*  And then I could stay at this frequency. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3813.0s)]
*  But one of the things it was telling me is to don't drink. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3815.0s)]
*  It was like right when I was there, it was like don't drink. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3818.0s)]
*  Because if you're drinking right now, you're going to kill this frequency. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3820.0s)]
*  It's going to dull it. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3822.0s)]
*  Like you might have less inhibitions, but it will dull this frequency. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3823.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3826.0s)]
*  It was very interesting. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3827.0s)]
*  It was like one of them weird mushroom moments. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3828.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3830.0s)]
*  Where the mushroom's like, hey, this is probably something you should think about. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3831.0s)]
*  Because I don't think you think about it this way. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3835.0s)]
*  You're just indulgent. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3837.0s)]
*  You do this, you do that. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3838.0s)]
*  You have a slice of pizza. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3840.0s)]
*  You eat a meatball sub. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3841.0s)]
*  But what's going on with your overall energy when you do that? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3842.0s)]
*  You really want your energy to be at the best possible state. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3847.0s)]
*  But you don't think about it that way. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3851.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3853.0s)]
*  But yeah, you don't think about it exactly like that way. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3854.0s)]
*  But we do think about it in ways like our attitude. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3856.0s)]
*  I think there's a lot of little words we use to describe like kind of like elements of it, I guess. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3860.0s)]
*  But I wonder in the future if there will be a way that we can measure whatever that frequency is. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3864.0s)]
*  Sometimes it feels like we're kind of primitive in the understanding, in the quantifying of... [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3869.0s)]
*  Like we take our temperature. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3876.0s)]
*  Just in things that we... [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3878.0s)]
*  Blood pressure. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3880.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3881.0s)]
*  In little things that we use to evaluate us, sometimes I feel like we're on a plane that feels really old sometimes. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3882.0s)]
*  It should be like another plane where we start to... [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3888.0s)]
*  Like is there a number for what my frequency is today? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3892.0s)]
*  Because you kind of feel that. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3895.0s)]
*  It's like where you operate at. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3897.0s)]
*  And there are things you can do to keep... [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3899.0s)]
*  Like I keep earplugs in now for like the first hour and a half of my day. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3901.0s)]
*  And it just keeps a lot of excess like noise in the... [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3905.0s)]
*  For the first hour and a half? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3908.0s)]
*  Yep, keeps them out. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3910.0s)]
*  I'm able to go through the things that I want to go through at home. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3911.0s)]
*  So what do you do when you wake up? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3913.0s)]
*  You just put them in? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3914.0s)]
*  I keep them in. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3915.0s)]
*  I sleep with them in. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3916.0s)]
*  You sleep with them in? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3917.0s)]
*  Do you? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3918.0s)]
*  Yep. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3919.0s)]
*  You sleep with earplugs in? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3920.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I've heard everything that you can hear at night. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3921.0s)]
*  You know, for a while I was scared I was going to miss something or something happened. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3923.0s)]
*  But I think it's like, dude, I'm not... [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3929.0s)]
*  They're not doing anything new at night that I wouldn't be able to just imagine is going on. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3931.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think there's a new invention of nighttime activity. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3936.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3939.0s)]
*  So I got them in and I'll keep them in, man. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3940.0s)]
*  And I go through like my morning routine and it's like... [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3942.0s)]
*  What is your morning routine? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3944.0s)]
*  I pray right when I wake up. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3946.0s)]
*  Do you have a specific prayer? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3948.0s)]
*  Yep, just a serenity prayer. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3950.0s)]
*  You know, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3952.0s)]
*  the courage to change the things I can, the wisdom to know the difference. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3956.0s)]
*  And then sometimes I do like one other prayer and then I read like these couple of pages of like... [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3961.0s)]
*  that give me like... help me to look at my day from afar. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3968.0s)]
*  Like, what am I going to do today? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3973.0s)]
*  So that helps me like have a little bit more of a plan for my day. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3975.0s)]
*  Even if it's not a strict plan, it's like at least I'm looking at my day instead of feeling like my day is just like... [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3978.0s)]
*  Happening to you. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3983.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3984.0s)]
*  And so that... those little things like that help me and then I'll do 10 minute meditation [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3985.0s)]
*  and then I do 10 minutes where I just write just whatever is going on in my head. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3989.0s)]
*  You do that every day? [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3995.0s)]
*  Yep. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3996.0s)]
*  How long have you been doing that? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3997.0s)]
*  I've been doing that probably pretty solid for I would say... [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=3998.0s)]
*  I don't know, maybe three months. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4005.0s)]
*  But I've done pieces of that for probably five years. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4006.0s)]
*  What started all that out? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4010.0s)]
*  Going... doing sober stuff like you get into that... some of that world, you know. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4012.0s)]
*  But it's... but I think also just like seeing how meditation gives me a little bit detached from myself. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4017.0s)]
*  So then I'm not like just clinging to everything that happens so it doesn't affect me immediately. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4025.0s)]
*  Something can happen and there's a little bit of space between me and whatever's happening. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4030.0s)]
*  And that gives me a chance to look at it or manage a little bit more comfortably. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4034.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a problem with getting caught up in the momentum of your day. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4039.0s)]
*  I do find myself in that spot sometimes. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4043.0s)]
*  I don't have that specific a routine as you do but maybe it's a good idea. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4045.0s)]
*  Yeah, for me I need it. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4048.0s)]
*  Some people they can operate differently. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4049.0s)]
*  You know, I think for me it helps to have a little bit of what's going on. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4051.0s)]
*  I remember watching this Kobe Bryant interview where he's talking about the first 10 minutes of every day. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4054.0s)]
*  When he wakes up he meditates. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4059.0s)]
*  10 minutes every day. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4060.0s)]
*  So he has like a clear path forward from the day. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4062.0s)]
*  He gets his day started off with the right mindset. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4066.0s)]
*  And that dude was all about mindset. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4069.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4071.0s)]
*  Mamba mindset, you know. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4072.0s)]
*  That dude is like the... he was the embodiment of hard work and discipline, you know. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4074.0s)]
*  And accomplishment. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4079.0s)]
*  And that was his way of starting out every day. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4081.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's... I think... yeah, I think also it gives me something... [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4083.0s)]
*  I kind of look forward to it a little bit the more I do it. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4087.0s)]
*  I look forward to that time that I spend. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4090.0s)]
*  But I'll leave those earplugs in, man, until I have to take them out. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4092.0s)]
*  Until like something comes along. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4095.0s)]
*  Do you live in a noisy place? [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4097.0s)]
*  I live in sometimes a place that has some noise. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4099.0s)]
*  You live in an apartment or a house? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4103.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have a house in Nashville but I have an apartment. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4105.0s)]
*  Still my old apartment in Los Angeles. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4108.0s)]
*  It's a little noisy. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4110.0s)]
*  LA's noisy. You can always hear something. You can hear somebody. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4112.0s)]
*  How often do you go back to LA? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4115.0s)]
*  Like four months out of the year. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4118.0s)]
*  Do you get sad? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4119.0s)]
*  Let me think what I get. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4121.0s)]

*  Yeah, yeah. The store. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4129.0s)]
*  Yeah, you walk up on him and his eyes light up, you know. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4131.0s)]
*  Yeah, hey, cocksucker. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4133.0s)]
*  That's what I love about the club that we have, that sign that says, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4135.0s)]
*  Get it together, bitch. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4139.0s)]

*  Yeah, Joey used to always say that to us. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4143.0s)]
*  He was so happy when he saw that. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4145.0s)]
*  Oh, that's cool, dude. Oh, that's awesome. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4147.0s)]
*  Because that was like his thing. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4150.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4152.0s)]
*  You were about to go on stage, he was firing you up, like, Get it together, bitch. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4153.0s)]
*  Let's go. Rock these motherfuckers. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4155.0s)]
*  Bro, yeah. There's something about, yeah, like. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4161.0s)]
*  Bro, he came into town and murdered. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4163.0s)]
*  Did he? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4165.0s)]
*  He murdered. He only wanted to do one set. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4166.0s)]
*  He was supposed to do two shows. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4167.0s)]
*  He's so funny, man. He's like a reluctant killer. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4168.0s)]
*  Because he hasn't been doing that much stand up, you know, because he's living in New Jersey. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4170.0s)]
*  And it was a seven o'clock show. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4174.0s)]
*  He goes, I'll do the 10. I'll do the 10. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4176.0s)]
*  I go, get the fuck out of here. You're here, man. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4178.0s)]
*  I go, go up, go up. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4180.0s)]
*  And he went up and fucking lit those people on fire. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4182.0s)]
*  The pop that he got, it was just like the pop that you got. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4186.0s)]
*  But even maybe even a little crazier. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4189.0s)]
*  The pop when Joey got on stage, they were like, No way. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4191.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4194.0s)]
*  Because he's only been there once. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4195.0s)]
*  Oh, it's like seeing Santa. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4196.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's how they did with Chappelle too. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4197.0s)]
*  When I brought Chappelle up at the club the first time, they went fucking ape shit. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4199.0s)]
*  They couldn't believe it. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4203.0s)]
*  How was Dave Chappelle here? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4204.0s)]
*  How is this real? [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4206.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, I remember watching Joey Diaz. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4207.0s)]
*  He's the, I would find myself get when he would, when his music would come on. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4209.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4213.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4216.0s)]
*  Whenever that would come on, I would literally without even doing it, I would be out of my seat. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4217.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4222.0s)]
*  I would be so excited. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4223.0s)]
*  He's the most watched comic by other comics. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4224.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4227.0s)]
*  I would imagine. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4228.0s)]
*  Don't you think like if you knew that Joey was going up in the OR, you'd go and have a seat in the back. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4229.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4233.0s)]
*  Always. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4234.0s)]
*  Yeah, because you're going to see something, you know. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4235.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4239.0s)]
*  He's all fired up. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4240.0s)]
*  He's going to say the words we're not supposed to say. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4242.0s)]
*  He's on 500 milligrams of edibles. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4244.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4246.0s)]
*  When he, one time I went over there and it was him and Lee Syatt, you know, when he's got Lee over there, like, and he would just like, Lee's on like 70,000. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4247.0s)]
*  The flying Jew. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4258.0s)]
*  He turned Lee Syatt into a fucking total edible head. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4259.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, Lee was a fucking. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4264.0s)]
*  He would fall asleep while he's producing the show. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4266.0s)]
*  He's producing the show. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4268.0s)]
*  There's a video of it, of him producing the show. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4269.0s)]
*  He's producing Joey's show. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4271.0s)]
*  He's like this. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4272.0s)]
*  Oh, well, here's what happened. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4273.0s)]
*  Out cold. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4275.0s)]
*  Here's what happened. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4276.0s)]
*  One time I get there and I was like, hey, I think I hear a little whistling in the headphones and Lee's like, oh, I'm trying to figure it out. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4277.0s)]
*  So Lee's like trying to figure it out. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4283.0s)]
*  By the end, he's eating so many edibles. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4285.0s)]
*  Lee was literally sitting there. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4286.0s)]
*  He's like, it was him. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4287.0s)]
*  It was him. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4290.0s)]
*  By the end. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4291.0s)]
*  In the beginning, it wasn't. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4295.0s)]
*  It was some other thing. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4296.0s)]
*  But we started recreating his own. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4298.0s)]
*  We manifested our own destiny, bro. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4300.0s)]
*  You got a video of him falling asleep? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4305.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4307.0s)]
*  Not asleep at all. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4308.0s)]
*  You saw the devil. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4313.0s)]
*  Shake them off. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4316.0s)]
*  Shake them up. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4317.0s)]
*  Shake them up. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4318.0s)]
*  Shake them up. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4319.0s)]
*  Shake them. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4320.0s)]
*  At least I haven't met the devil. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4321.0s)]
*  Right there. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4323.0s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4324.0s)]
*  He tortured people. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4325.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4326.0s)]
*  What's a matter with you? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4327.0s)]
*  Dude, one time we were. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4328.0s)]
*  Schizophrenic breaks. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4329.0s)]
*  We did some LSD, right? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4330.0s)]
*  We were children, right? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4331.0s)]
*  And so we went to the Waffle House because it was open, you know? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4332.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4335.0s)]
*  Like when you were on drugs and you were a kid, you basically like that's the downside of having any place that stays open all night is like people are going to come there. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4336.0s)]
*  They're all on drugs. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4343.0s)]
*  No one's sober at Waffle House. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4344.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4345.0s)]
*  So we get there, dude. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4346.0s)]
*  And we're in there. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4347.0s)]
*  And my buddy starts laughing so hard. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4348.0s)]
*  He's like kind of convulsing a little bit. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4349.0s)]
*  My buddy Scott. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4350.0s)]
*  And the waiter was a black gentleman and a gay guy. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4351.0s)]
*  And we'd never seen a gay black dude, right? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4352.0s)]
*  So anyway, he starts doing the Heimlich maneuver on my buddy, right? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4353.0s)]
*  And he wasn't choking. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4354.0s)]
*  He was just losing his shit because he was so drunk. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4355.0s)]
*  And he was just like, oh, I'm going to get a drink. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4356.0s)]
*  And he was like, oh, I'm going to get a drink. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4357.0s)]
*  And he was like, oh, I'm going to get a drink. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4358.0s)]
*  And he was like, oh, I'm going to get a drink. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4359.0s)]
*  And he was just losing his shit because he was so fucking geeked up on LSD. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4360.0s)]
*  So gross. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4379.0s)]
*  This dude's doing a Heimlich maneuver and he's not even choking? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4380.0s)]
*  Did you tell him he wasn't choking? [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4383.0s)]
*  I couldn't speak. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4384.0s)]
*  I was laughing so fucking hard. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4385.0s)]
*  It was unreal, dude. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4387.0s)]
*  Then how did he, did he figure out that your buddy wasn't choking? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4388.0s)]
*  I think I disappeared and just woke up in the sixth grade. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4393.0s)]
*  But man, I just, we laughed so fucking hard. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4399.0s)]
*  These guys try to give you a Heimlich. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4402.0s)]

*  It was scary, but it was exciting, you know? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4419.0s)]
*  Jamie, did you put another one of these down? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4423.0s)]

*  Probably. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4480.0s)]

*  Yeah, this is my own. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4500.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you got your own and so does Israel Adesanya, right? [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4501.0s)]
*  This is Flaming Joe. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4504.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4507.0s)]
*  It's nice. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4508.0s)]
*  I talked to this guy one time on the phone. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4509.0s)]
*  He's a really nice guy. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4510.0s)]
*  Oh, he's the best. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4511.0s)]
*  John's the best. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4512.0s)]
*  And we got a new one coming out with a compilation, a collaboration with me and Kam Ains. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4513.0s)]
*  It's a spicy cherry called Elk Blood. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4519.0s)]
*  Oh, nice, boy. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4522.0s)]
*  It's good, dude. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4524.0s)]
*  Keep hammering, dude. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4525.0s)]
*  We went through like, I had to go through like seven or eight versions to get to this. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4526.0s)]
*  This is perfect, which I think is like the perfect flavor. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4531.0s)]
*  This one is a pineapple, like a spicy pineapple. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4533.0s)]
*  It's like pineapple with a little bit of jalapeno in there. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4538.0s)]
*  This is a very addictive drink. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4541.0s)]
*  Yeah, I like having me a little something. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4543.0s)]
*  I didn't have any caffeine all day today because I wanted to wait until I had some in here. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4545.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4549.0s)]
*  You managed that? [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4550.0s)]
*  Yep. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4551.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm waiting until I get in there and it's going to be exciting. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4552.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4555.0s)]
*  I'm going to have it when I get in there. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4556.0s)]
*  What's the most time you've ever spent off of caffeine? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4557.0s)]
*  30, I would say 30 days. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4559.0s)]
*  I had Michael Pollan on and he was explaining, he took, I think he took like three months. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4561.0s)]
*  Is that what he said? [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4566.0s)]
*  Something like that? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4567.0s)]
*  Three months off of caffeine. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4568.0s)]
*  And he said when he had it, he was like, it was like a psychedelic experience. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4569.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4573.0s)]
*  It's like, it's so different when your body's not accustomed to caffeine and you have it. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4574.0s)]
*  It's like you have this insane feeling of bliss. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4577.0s)]
*  It's like, it's really wild. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4580.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4582.0s)]
*  Well, we were doing that, remember I used to do those vapes, remember? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4583.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4588.0s)]
*  And right now. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4589.0s)]
*  I quit those. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4590.0s)]
*  Me too. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4591.0s)]
*  Too addictive. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4592.0s)]
*  And I didn't like it. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4593.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4594.0s)]
*  And it made me tired. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4595.0s)]
*  Like I was tired. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4596.0s)]
*  Oh, I'd have a cup of tea and you start to shut down a little. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4597.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4599.0s)]
*  But the first hit is magical. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4600.0s)]
*  The first hit I take a big puff and it'd be like, like everything just washes over you, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4602.0s)]
*  you feel so relaxed. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4608.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4609.0s)]
*  It's brain cells dying. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4610.0s)]
*  It's like, it's like a kid. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4611.0s)]
*  It's like a kid in stupid or where everything's going to be okay. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4612.0s)]
*  Because I feel like the more smart you are, the more you take into account all the possibilities [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4615.0s)]
*  and all the variables and all the things that can go wrong. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4621.0s)]
*  But one hit of that vape and you're like this. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4623.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4625.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4626.0s)]
*  But then I was always chasing that dragon. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4627.0s)]
*  Yep. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4629.0s)]
*  And then later on in the night I noticed I'd be hitting it and nothing would happen. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4630.0s)]
*  I'd be like, what am I doing here? [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4633.0s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't, I think we did Esco bars or whatever. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4635.0s)]
*  Oh, and then one time I went into a place and the lady's like, this is the strongest one they got. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4638.0s)]
*  This bitch is the strongest. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4642.0s)]
*  She's like, every hit is like smoking five cigarettes. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4644.0s)]
*  And then she would fucking hit it and no joke, her hair would curl. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4647.0s)]
*  Smokes coming out of her ears. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4653.0s)]
*  This bitch like hitting five cigarettes. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4659.0s)]
*  He fucking hit that bitch, boy. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4661.0s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't fucked with the vapes in quite a while, but I have friends that still hit them. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4663.0s)]
*  I have friends that still hit them all the time and you see like, oh, I see that. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4667.0s)]
*  I see that little demon that's in your body. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4670.0s)]
*  I'm about six days off right now and I'm really battling. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4672.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4676.0s)]
*  Oh, you're battling still. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4677.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to see somebody with one. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4678.0s)]
*  That's the tough moment for me. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4679.0s)]
*  Yeah, you just want to grab it. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4681.0s)]
*  Give me a hit of that. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4682.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4683.0s)]
*  So last night I didn't see anybody with one. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4684.0s)]
*  I took a couple puffs off a cigarette though. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4685.0s)]
*  I hadn't had that in a few years. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4687.0s)]

*  Scroll back up to the top. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4819.0s)]
*  What does it say at the top? [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4820.0s)]
*  It says both propene glycol and vegetable glycerin are considered safe to use in vaping products, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4821.0s)]
*  but some users may find one or the other preferable due to personal preference. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4826.0s)]
*  I'm not considering this website. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4830.0s)]

*  of one of those, you're not supposed to drink a full one, you're supposed to drink a half [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4897.0s)]
*  of one. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4900.0s)]
*  Why don't they make it in smaller dosage so it's a single serving because it's only that [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4901.0s)]
*  big. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4905.0s)]

*  Slurping on each other. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4930.0s)]
*  You're going to put a little cup on top of the fucking poor buddy's? [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4931.0s)]
*  I would if it was only one for the two of us and we're both thirsty. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4934.0s)]
*  Yeah, but still, who's doing that? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4938.0s)]
*  Very, very rarely. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4939.0s)]

*  The live free thing? [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4946.0s)]
*  I just typed in Kava Kratom drink. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4947.0s)]
*  Yeah, but just Google live free because it's one very specific. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4949.0s)]
*  What I'm bringing up is there's a lawsuit because this one dude, they were getting them at 7-Eleven and a bunch of different places. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4952.0s)]
*  And this one dude was an alcoholic and a drug addict, I guess. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4960.0s)]
*  And he was clean and sober and started drinking these things and went off the deep end. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4965.0s)]
*  And he was drinking 10 a day, which is crazy. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4970.0s)]
*  That's 20 doses a day. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4974.0s)]
*  You're not supposed to have more than two in a day. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4976.0s)]
*  Two doses, we mean one bottle. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4978.0s)]
*  That's more than you're supposed to have in an entire day. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4981.0s)]
*  Damn. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4983.0s)]
*  And this dude was down in 10 a day. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4984.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4985.0s)]
*  So he was going against any guidelines that they had. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4986.0s)]
*  This is what it looks like? [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4989.0s)]
*  Yes, that's exactly what it looks like. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4991.0s)]
*  So what I'm finding, Kratom is not listed on it, but what they've found, well I guess it is here, but what they found, I guess maybe it wasn't being sold that way. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=4993.0s)]
*  It was being sold as a Kava drink that had Kratom in it and people didn't know it had Kratom in it. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5001.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5005.0s)]
*  Well, I've read varying accounts as to how much Kratom is in it. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5006.0s)]
*  I don't think Kratom is necessarily dangerous, but I do know that some people abuse it for sure. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5010.0s)]
*  Recovering Alcoholics sues wellness drink firm for getting him hooked on 10 of its feel-free Kava drinks a day that left him hospitalized because they contain addictive morphine-like substance Kratom. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5017.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5028.0s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5029.0s)]
*  10 a day is a lot. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5030.0s)]
*  10 diet cokes is a lot. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5031.0s)]
*  But whose fault is it? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5033.0s)]
*  It's his fault. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5035.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's his fault. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5037.0s)]
*  10 a day is his fault. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5038.0s)]
*  But the thing is, I think what he's saying is they didn't say there was Kratom in it. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5040.0s)]
*  Oh, totally. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5045.0s)]
*  Because it doesn't say, I don't even think it says on the website that Kratom is in it. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5046.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure I Googled the website. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5050.0s)]
*  Go Google the live-free website and see if it even says Kratom on the website. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5052.0s)]
*  And a lot of the Chinese, I think, are hopped up on this, right? [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5056.0s)]
*  Are they? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5059.0s)]
*  I think so. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5061.0s)]
*  I know a lot of addicts like it. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5062.0s)]
*  Kratom, I believe, is popular in the Far East. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5064.0s)]
*  Well, it's pretty popular everywhere. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5070.0s)]
*  So let's see what it says is in there. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5072.0s)]
*  So this is the stuff. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5075.0s)]
*  What does it say is in there? [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5077.0s)]
*  Does it give you a list of ingredients? [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5079.0s)]
*  Classic tonic, feel-free tonic. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5081.0s)]
*  This one says Kratom is in it right there. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5083.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5085.0s)]
*  That's the classic. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5086.0s)]
*  And then there's another one. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5087.0s)]
*  Kava, kola nut, lion's mane. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5088.0s)]
*  Oh, so there's a feel-free tonic and then there's the classic tonic. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5090.0s)]
*  So the classic tonic is the one that we got. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5095.0s)]
*  So what does it say in there? [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5097.0s)]
*  What does it say the ingredients are? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5099.0s)]
*  I'd rather magic, mind. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5101.0s)]
*  Have you had that? [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5103.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a mushroom. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5105.0s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5107.0s)]
*  It's a nootropic. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5108.0s)]
*  Lion's mane is good. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5110.0s)]
*  Lion's mane is good for cognitive function. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5111.0s)]
*  But when it comes to actual nootropics that help, okay, here it goes. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5113.0s)]
*  Kava, kratom, so the kratom is total alkaloids. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5119.0s)]
*  So it's mostly kava and a little bit of kratom. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5123.0s)]
*  34 milligrams. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5126.0s)]
*  I heard a joke one time. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5128.0s)]
*  This guy, this is the worst joke I've ever heard. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5131.0s)]
*  Do you want to hear it? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5133.0s)]
*  I would love to. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5134.0s)]
*  This guy goes, hey, you know why you should take kava? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5135.0s)]
*  Why? [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5137.0s)]
*  Be kava. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5138.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5140.0s)]
*  Pretty bad, huh? [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5142.0s)]
*  Did you keep hanging out with that dude? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5143.0s)]
*  I just remember that. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5145.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a dumb one. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5148.0s)]
*  But those drinks, those put you in a nice place. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5150.0s)]
*  Whatever the fuck is in there. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5154.0s)]
*  But I knew a dude. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5156.0s)]
*  What do you mean, the feel-freeze? [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5158.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5159.0s)]
*  See, I didn't have one, man. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5160.0s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what I had mostly. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5161.0s)]
*  I do diet coke. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5162.0s)]
*  Yeah, those feel-freeze are basically a drug. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5164.0s)]
*  So do you recommend it, you think? [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5166.0s)]
*  Maybe I'll try one tonight. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5168.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5169.0s)]
*  Everybody in the club is a little wary of them. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5170.0s)]
*  Some of the guys have read the class action lawsuit. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5172.0s)]
*  Sometimes you've got to go into those things [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5175.0s)]
*  and find out what is really going on with these. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5177.0s)]
*  When you find out the guy was taking ten a day, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5179.0s)]
*  and then also you find out the guy was an addict, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5182.0s)]
*  and you go, well, what kind of money, how far gone? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5184.0s)]
*  Was he a guy who had disappeared for three months [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5187.0s)]
*  and came back with a bloody face? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5189.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5191.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5192.0s)]
*  Yeah, we had a roommate that used to eat all these breath mints, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5193.0s)]
*  and he would stack those Altoids. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5197.0s)]
*  He'd get a big stack of them, and he would always kind of show off [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5200.0s)]
*  how many he could stack in between his teeth, you know? [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5203.0s)]
*  But he would go out and get drunk at night, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5206.0s)]
*  and in the morning he'd be on the sofa just in a bloody suit. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5208.0s)]
*  He'd be in a suit, but just fucking... [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5211.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. He looked like a reservoir dog. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5214.0s)]
*  Some people live in alternative realities occasionally. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5217.0s)]
*  They just get fucked up, and then they go away, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5221.0s)]
*  and then they come back, and then they have to piece together [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5224.0s)]
*  what the fuck happened to them. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5226.0s)]
*  One shoe on, fucked up knee. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5228.0s)]
*  What's wrong with my hand? [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5230.0s)]
*  How come I can't hear? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5232.0s)]
*  It's like some people just go so hard. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5237.0s)]
*  God, dude. I'm almost scared. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5240.0s)]
*  Do you get jealous of those people sometimes? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5242.0s)]
*  Sometimes I'm jealous of those people. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5244.0s)]
*  Look at this. Does kava feel exanis? [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5246.0s)]
*  It's found that kava significantly relieves anxiety [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5248.0s)]
*  with mild to no side effects. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5252.0s)]
*  Several studies have found that kava extract [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5254.0s)]
*  is comparable to antidepressants and bicarbonate. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5256.0s)]
*  Antidepressants and benzodiazepines. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5259.0s)]
*  Yeah, but doesn't kava... [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5261.0s)]
*  That's Dave Asprey, though. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5263.0s)]
*  Doesn't kava also cause liver problems? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5265.0s)]
*  Google that. Does kava negatively affect your liver? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5272.0s)]
*  Because I think kava has an effect, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5276.0s)]
*  especially at high doses, that is similar to alcohol. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5278.0s)]
*  More than 100 cases of liver toxicity [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5282.0s)]
*  related to the use of kava have been identified. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5284.0s)]
*  Some leading to liver transplant, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5287.0s)]
*  and some leading to death, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5289.0s)]
*  as people who have died from kava. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5291.0s)]
*  People who have died from ice cream, too. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5293.0s)]
*  There are many reasons for liver damage. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5295.0s)]
*  For one, kava depletes glutathione, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5297.0s)]
*  a chief antioxidant within the liver. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5299.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5301.0s)]
*  But I wonder if you take it with glutathione. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5303.0s)]
*  There's kava bars in Austin, I just found out. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5305.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5307.0s)]
*  We should do a field trip, huh? [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5309.0s)]
*  Go to the kava bars? Go kava bar hopping? [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5311.0s)]
*  See what it is? [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5314.0s)]
*  Whatever is in that feel free is like, [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5316.0s)]
*  woo, that's a nice feeling. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5318.0s)]
*  I'm going to have to try a little bit tonight, I think. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5320.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was just a little wary of it [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5322.0s)]
*  when everybody at the club got nervous, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5324.0s)]
*  so I had to start doing a deep dive, like, what's in it? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5326.0s)]
*  What are people worried about? [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5328.0s)]
*  What's this lawsuit? What's the class action lawsuit? [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5330.0s)]
*  How do you feel when you drink it? [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5332.0s)]
*  Very relaxed. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5334.0s)]
*  I just want to start dancing. Yeah, I like it. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5336.0s)]
*  I don't think it's bad. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5338.0s)]
*  I always just judge, like, how do I feel? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5340.0s)]
*  How do I feel after? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5342.0s)]
*  And after, I feel fine. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5344.0s)]
*  I feel fine. There was no hangover. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5346.0s)]
*  There's many times where I feel good [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5348.0s)]
*  because I had a few tequilas, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5350.0s)]
*  and then get up in the morning, I'm like, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5352.0s)]
*  oh, you fucking idiot, you know? [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5354.0s)]
*  A little bit of a headache, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5356.0s)]
*  dragging my ass, and then I get in a cold plunge, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5358.0s)]
*  and I just feel like an idiot. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5360.0s)]
*  It's hard to get back to even. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5362.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to get back to even. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5364.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, I used to do, sometimes I would do [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5366.0s)]
*  so much cocaine, my freaking eyes would dry out. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5368.0s)]
*  Look at you grinding. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5370.0s)]
*  You're thinking about it. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5372.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, yeah. Fucking, argh. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5374.0s)]
*  I remember I had to lick my hands and then rub it into my eyes. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5376.0s)]
*  Whoa. So that I could even blink well. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5378.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5380.0s)]
*  I would get dehydrated, boy. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5382.0s)]
*  That's deep. You go deep, huh? [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5384.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. But you're that dude. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5386.0s)]
*  You go deep with whatever the fuck you're doing. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5388.0s)]
*  I like to get right on the fuck, [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5390.0s)]
*  and I like to be a peeping tom if I can. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5392.0s)]
*  I'll watch your whole family eat dinner. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5394.0s)]
*  I'll watch your whole family eat dinner. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5396.0s)]
*  I used to look at you, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5398.0s)]
*  I used to love that shit. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5400.0s)]
*  On coke. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5402.0s)]
*  On anything. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5404.0s)]
*  Boy, I fucking love to watch a family eat from the distance. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5406.0s)]
*  The audio of you and I talking about how addictive vapes are, [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5408.0s)]
*  that has been used on so many different TikTok videos and reels. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5412.0s)]
*  How addictive are those things? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5418.0s)]
*  I didn't want to divert too far, but have you ever heard of this thing called [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5420.0s)]
*  frogging, spelled with a PH? [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5422.0s)]
*  No. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5424.0s)]
*  No, you heard of it. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5426.0s)]
*  It's like an online community. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5428.0s)]
*  There's probably a website. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5430.0s)]
*  People try to live in your house without you knowing about it. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5432.0s)]
*  For an extended period of time. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5434.0s)]
*  That's a good way to die. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5436.0s)]
*  I guarantee you that doesn't take place much in Texas. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5438.0s)]
*  That's true. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5440.0s)]
*  I think that's a San Francisco game. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5442.0s)]
*  I don't buy that. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5444.0s)]
*  Dude, one time I had a babysitter, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5446.0s)]
*  and they found a guy under their bed in their house. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5450.0s)]
*  What a scary thing that was. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5452.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5454.0s)]
*  She came up the stairs and she could see under the bed, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5456.0s)]
*  because the bedroom door was open when she walked up the stairs, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5460.0s)]
*  and she saw a guy under there. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5462.0s)]
*  Oh Jesus, what did they do? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5464.0s)]
*  Called the police. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5466.0s)]
*  He was mentally unwell. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5468.0s)]
*  Duh. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5470.0s)]
*  It's not like these really have their shit together. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5472.0s)]
*  They're hiding under kids' beds. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5474.0s)]
*  It's true. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5476.0s)]
*  He was mentally unwell. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5478.0s)]
*  Can you keep it down? I've got to be up. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5480.0s)]
*  I've got to be at work in two hours. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5482.0s)]
*  Let's not label the guy. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5484.0s)]
*  He was doing a little bit of frogging. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5486.0s)]
*  Whatever, whatever. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5488.0s)]
*  But I love how we're in a space now, Joe, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5490.0s)]
*  where people breaking and living in people's houses is just like a new turn. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5492.0s)]
*  As I'm reading into an article about it, this makes a whole lot of sense, [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5496.0s)]
*  because I've lived in a place where it's explaining. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5500.0s)]
*  It says it happened at Ohio State. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5502.0s)]
*  There's giant houses where 14 people are living together [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5504.0s)]
*  and they're hanging out all day long, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5506.0s)]
*  and someone can sneak into a room, [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5508.0s)]
*  and you just think it's a friend if you saw them in the hallway. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5510.0s)]
*  That's a little bit different. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5512.0s)]
*  It's a slightly different thing. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5514.0s)]
*  Why do they name it frogging? [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5516.0s)]
*  It's not a guy eating flies and stuff and hiding in your wall. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5518.0s)]
*  Because they go from place to place. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5520.0s)]
*  Sometimes it's trying to do it as much as they can. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5522.0s)]
*  Victims often sense something is amiss, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5526.0s)]
*  but easily doubt themselves and hesitate to seek help. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5528.0s)]
*  At least at first. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5532.0s)]
*  Not me, bro. I'll be clearing that house. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5534.0s)]
*  Locked and loaded. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5536.0s)]
*  I probably have a vest on. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5538.0s)]
*  I'll probably velcro a vest on and go clear that fucking house. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5540.0s)]
*  I would just ask everybody if they live there or not. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5544.0s)]
*  How do you not know if somebody lives with you? [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5548.0s)]
*  Because they're sneaking around. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5550.0s)]
*  They're sleeping in closets and shit. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5552.0s)]
*  They're all fucked up all day. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5554.0s)]
*  They're 20-year-old kids. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5556.0s)]
*  I'm talking about a regular house, like your house. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5558.0s)]
*  Yeah, if somebody was sleeping, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5560.0s)]
*  I did think there was somebody in the attic for a while, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5562.0s)]
*  because I would hear things sometimes, like little settling, [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5564.0s)]
*  but I went up there and there's nothing. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5566.0s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what else has been going on. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5568.0s)]
*  The other thing I saw last night, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5572.0s)]
*  the American Gladiators documentary started on ESPN. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5574.0s)]
*  Have you seen any of it or anything? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5576.0s)]
*  Well, dude, I was around when the American Gladiators was huge. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5578.0s)]
*  So this is the guy that created it or has founded it. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5582.0s)]
*  The documentary is very interesting, [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5584.0s)]
*  because this guy who is credited as the creator, I think, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5586.0s)]
*  he's not very forthcoming and honest with everything, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5590.0s)]
*  and he won't answer the guy's questions a lot, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5592.0s)]
*  which is kind of strange. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5594.0s)]
*  So he made a good documentary about it, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5596.0s)]
*  and not all the Gladiators would come talk about it. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5598.0s)]
*  He's very open about the, like, I didn't pay them, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5600.0s)]
*  and if they wanted to leave, go ahead and leave. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5604.0s)]
*  What? The American Gladiators didn't get paid? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5606.0s)]
*  They were making $25,000 for 52 episodes, they said. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5608.0s)]
*  What? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5612.0s)]
*  Yeah, two shows a day. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5614.0s)]
*  That's what they get into in this, is how big the marketing got. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5616.0s)]
*  There was 13 million viewers, I think, at one point per show. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5618.0s)]
*  He crushed it with all the... [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5620.0s)]
*  And he paid them nothing. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5622.0s)]
*  They were getting hurt really bad. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5624.0s)]
*  One of the guys who's a big one this show, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5626.0s)]
*  how bad he is right now, he's walking around, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5628.0s)]
*  he can't feel half of his limbs, having herniated discs. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5630.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5632.0s)]
*  Remember they had names, it was like fierce, and like river. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5634.0s)]
*  Yeah, ice cube. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5636.0s)]
*  Yeah, thunder. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5638.0s)]
*  Thunder. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5640.0s)]
*  Barnacle. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5642.0s)]
*  Lethargy. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5644.0s)]
*  Didn't they bring American Gladiators back at one point in time? [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5646.0s)]
*  Yeah, they tried bringing it back, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5648.0s)]
*  but the thing I find interesting about this guy is [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5650.0s)]
*  he started off his career as an Elvis personator, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5652.0s)]
*  which is why he looks a little bit like Elvis. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5654.0s)]
*  That dude doesn't look anything like Elvis. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5656.0s)]
*  He's lying. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5658.0s)]
*  He was obsessed with Elvis? [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5660.0s)]
*  That could have been part of it. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5662.0s)]
*  He could be putting on about how much he got. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5664.0s)]
*  Ben Berman, huh? [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5666.0s)]
*  It's a very interesting documentary, I'll just say it that. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5668.0s)]
*  Oh, you mean like he might have been lying about how much money he made? [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5670.0s)]
*  He's lying about a lot of stuff, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5672.0s)]
*  and the guy who's making it asks him, [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5674.0s)]
*  and you can hear him asking him, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5676.0s)]
*  and he just sort of stops, like, I'm not going to talk about that. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5678.0s)]
*  He looks like a low-level MMA promoter. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5680.0s)]
*  That's what he looks like. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5682.0s)]
*  He looks like one of those guys that, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5684.0s)]
*  our guys could take on the UFC's best champions any day of the week. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5686.0s)]
*  He's one of those guys. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5688.0s)]
*  That's what he looks like. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5690.0s)]
*  Yeah, that guy definitely looks maybe a little bit [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5692.0s)]
*  like a sneaky guy. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5694.0s)]
*  Oh, he definitely looks sneaky. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5696.0s)]
*  I'm trying to think of the first sneaky guy I ever met. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5698.0s)]
*  The first sneaky guy you ever met? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5700.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5702.0s)]
*  You really can go back that far? [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5704.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, when you met someone like that. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5706.0s)]
*  Sneaky. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5708.0s)]
*  Sneaky. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5710.0s)]
*  Well, you mean a lot of them in the comedy business. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5712.0s)]
*  The kind of club owner business. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5714.0s)]
*  You ever been ripped off by a club? [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5716.0s)]
*  Dude, there was a club where I felt bad [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5718.0s)]
*  that people didn't come, [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5720.0s)]
*  and I was like, you guys can pay me less, [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5722.0s)]
*  and they paid me less, I remember. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5724.0s)]
*  Because no one was there? [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5726.0s)]
*  You said they could. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5728.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5730.0s)]
*  That's not a robbery. That's a deal. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5732.0s)]
*  You made a deal. You were a nice guy. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5734.0s)]
*  You were trying to help out the club, and you felt bad. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5736.0s)]
*  Made a bad deal. Get another hit for that. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5738.0s)]
*  Feel better. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5740.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus, you went in deep. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5744.0s)]
*  You got your nostrils right up to the... [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5746.0s)]
*  Give me that. I like that. I don't want you to be out there on your own. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5748.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5750.0s)]
*  A hunting we will go. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5752.0s)]
*  A hunting... [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5754.0s)]
*  You want some of this, Jamie? [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5756.0s)]
*  You remember? Oh, that's all you need? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5758.0s)]
*  I can't remember. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5760.0s)]
*  I just did it 10 seconds ago. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5762.0s)]
*  See? [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5764.0s)]
*  Dude, you sound like a guy crying in the 40s. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5768.0s)]
*  Like his dog died. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5772.0s)]
*  Oh, D'Eller, I'm going to miss you. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5776.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5780.0s)]
*  Do you ever think... [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5782.0s)]
*  Remember we were talking about frequencies? [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5784.0s)]
*  There could be other ways to evaluate what's going on with us. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5786.0s)]
*  Do you think we'll ever get [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5788.0s)]
*  new ways to look at ours? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5790.0s)]
*  To quantify ourselves and how we're feeling and stuff? [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5792.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so with science. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5794.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think with new innovation and technology. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5796.0s)]
*  They'll probably develop ways [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5798.0s)]
*  to recognize the amount of energy [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5800.0s)]
*  that your body has. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5802.0s)]
*  Because some people are just... [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5804.0s)]
*  They have energy. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5806.0s)]
*  I always think of that. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5808.0s)]
*  I switched back to the carnivore diet. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5810.0s)]
*  I go back and forth on that. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5812.0s)]
*  And for the most part, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5814.0s)]
*  I eat mostly meat. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5816.0s)]
*  I eat meat, I eat meat, I eat meat. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5818.0s)]
*  I eat mostly meat and fruit [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5820.0s)]
*  and some vegetables. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5822.0s)]
*  That's like most of my diet. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5824.0s)]
*  Occasionally I go crazy, like we were in the Bronx, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5826.0s)]
*  we went to this Italian deli and these giant sandwiches. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5828.0s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5830.0s)]
*  But that's a rare deviation off my path. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5832.0s)]
*  But I had this moment, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5834.0s)]
*  I guess it was about two weeks ago, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5836.0s)]
*  where I was like, you know what? [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5838.0s)]
*  The best I ever felt, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5840.0s)]
*  like literally the best I ever felt [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5842.0s)]
*  all throughout the day was when I was on the carnivore diet. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5844.0s)]
*  Let me go back to that. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5846.0s)]
*  Let me see what that's like. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5848.0s)]
*  And one of the things that I saw, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5850.0s)]
*  immediately, for seven, eight days, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5852.0s)]
*  I ate nothing but meat and eggs [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5854.0s)]
*  and fat and bacon [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5856.0s)]
*  and nothing else. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5858.0s)]
*  I was real strict. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5860.0s)]
*  And my brain was working so much better. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5862.0s)]
*  It was weird. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5864.0s)]
*  I wasn't searching for... [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5866.0s)]
*  It was like I had more access [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5868.0s)]
*  to my ability to form sentences, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5870.0s)]
*  I was thinking clearer, [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5872.0s)]
*  it was more effortless to have conversations. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5874.0s)]
*  And I was like, this is interesting. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5876.0s)]
*  This is very interesting, [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5878.0s)]
*  because this is not how I normally feel. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5880.0s)]
*  This is like me at my optimum, [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5882.0s)]
*  but I'm able to sustain this [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5884.0s)]
*  multiple days in a row. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5886.0s)]
*  And I think that a lot of the foods [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5888.0s)]
*  that we eat, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5890.0s)]
*  foods that have preservatives, a lot of bread [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5892.0s)]
*  and bullshit and just shitty food, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5894.0s)]
*  your body uses so much resources [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5896.0s)]
*  to process that, and it's not real food. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5898.0s)]
*  It's kind of bad for you, right? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5900.0s)]
*  And so your body is just like [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5902.0s)]
*  overburdened with this extra work. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5904.0s)]
*  When you eat clean, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5906.0s)]
*  like really clean, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5908.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, wild game [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5910.0s)]
*  and fat and beef tallow [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5912.0s)]
*  and all that and eggs, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5914.0s)]
*  your body doesn't have any bullshit to process. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5916.0s)]
*  So your body is [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5918.0s)]
*  less inflame... [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5920.0s)]
*  You have less inflammation, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5922.0s)]
*  and you're operating off of ketones, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5924.0s)]
*  essentially, for the most part, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5926.0s)]
*  because your body is entering into a ketogenic state. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5928.0s)]
*  You have [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5930.0s)]
*  just... [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5932.0s)]
*  You just feel even [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5934.0s)]
*  through the whole day. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5936.0s)]
*  I never felt like at the end of the day, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5938.0s)]
*  like, oh, boy, I'm tired. There was none of that. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5940.0s)]
*  So that's mostly on the keto diet. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5942.0s)]
*  Well, it's carnivore. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5944.0s)]
*  But carnivore, you must reach [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5946.0s)]
*  periods of ketosis. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5948.0s)]
*  There's a process [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5950.0s)]
*  called [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5952.0s)]
*  gluconeogenesis, [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5954.0s)]
*  I believe it is, see if that's correct. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5956.0s)]
*  And I think that what that is, is when [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5958.0s)]
*  your body consumes only protein, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5960.0s)]
*  your body will convert [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5962.0s)]
*  some of that protein into glucose. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5964.0s)]
*  And that actually can knock you [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5966.0s)]
*  out of a ketogenic state if you eat too much [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5968.0s)]
*  protein. But... [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5970.0s)]
*  But when you eat like [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5972.0s)]
*  that, I mean, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5974.0s)]
*  everybody's different, clearly. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5976.0s)]
*  I know people that function very well on a vegetarian [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5978.0s)]
*  diet. Not for me, dude. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5980.0s)]
*  I'm like a lunch of this. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5982.0s)]
*  Yeah, gluconeogenesis take you out of ketosis. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5984.0s)]
*  A widespread fear surrounding [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5986.0s)]
*  keto is that consuming too much protein [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5988.0s)]
*  may lead to the upregulation of a process [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5990.0s)]
*  called gluconeogenesis [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5992.0s)]
*  and throw you out of ketosis, undoing [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5994.0s)]
*  all your hard work. The truth is, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5996.0s)]
*  gluconeogenesis is essential [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=5998.0s)]
*  for our overall health and actually allows [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6000.0s)]
*  us to remain in ketosis. Oh, okay. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6002.0s)]
*  So it's good. So whatever that is, [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6004.0s)]
*  that's how I function at my best. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6006.0s)]
*  So that's how I eat now. Like last night, [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6008.0s)]
*  when Dave brought the pizza backstage, it looked good. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6010.0s)]
*  What'd you do? I wanted a piece. I was like, I'm not [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6012.0s)]
*  eating it. Did you leave the room or anything? [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6014.0s)]
*  No. Or what were some of your methods you used to stay away from it? [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6016.0s)]
*  I don't really, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6018.0s)]
*  I don't have to do that. I just go, no. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6020.0s)]
*  Just not eating it. Did you do [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6022.0s)]
*  a gum or anything to keep yourself busy? [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6024.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. I wasn't even itchy. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6026.0s)]
*  I wasn't itchy. You know, [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6028.0s)]
*  if I had a couple of cocktails in me though, I probably would've [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6030.0s)]
*  grabbed a slice. Oh, fuck yeah, boy. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6032.0s)]
*  That's the problem. Couple of co- couple of [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6034.0s)]
*  tequilas. Oh yeah. Next thing you know, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6036.0s)]
*  I want some pizza. Oh, dude, I'll fucking [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6038.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'll do whatever [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6040.0s)]
*  after that, boy. But I think I'm tequila. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6042.0s)]
*  I think I'm done. I lost five [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6044.0s)]
*  pounds in two [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6046.0s)]
*  weeks. And not [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6048.0s)]
*  anything but fat. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6050.0s)]
*  Just like, just immediately my [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6052.0s)]
*  body just went shriveled [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6054.0s)]
*  up. Do you have some fitness goals? Like at [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6056.0s)]
*  this point in your life, you've kind of been through [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6058.0s)]
*  fitness a lot, it's been a big part of your life. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6060.0s)]
*  Do some of your fitness goals kind of change [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6062.0s)]
*  as we get a little bit older, do you think? [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6064.0s)]
*  Not for me. No. Yeah. No. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6066.0s)]
*  Because with hormone replacement [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6068.0s)]
*  and all the stuff that I do, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6070.0s)]
*  even at 55, my body functions [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6072.0s)]
*  essentially the same way it did when I was [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6074.0s)]
*  30. And I'm not exaggerating, like I have [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6076.0s)]
*  no problem doing hard workouts, kettle [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6078.0s)]
*  bells, heavy bag workout, jujitsu. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6080.0s)]
*  Injuries are an issue, [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6082.0s)]
*  you know, with me. Like I just tweaked my [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6084.0s)]
*  back muscle the other day doing some deadlifts. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6086.0s)]
*  But nothing serious. But [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6088.0s)]
*  as far as like [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6090.0s)]
*  fitness goals is just to maintain this. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6092.0s)]
*  I know I have an [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6094.0s)]
*  extraordinary level of fitness from my age [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6096.0s)]
*  and I just maintain that. And I think [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6098.0s)]
*  that if you can maintain it, that's the key. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6100.0s)]
*  The real problem with people is they get [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6102.0s)]
*  out of shape and then getting back in shape is very [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6104.0s)]
*  hard. It's a fucking grind. Yeah. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6106.0s)]
*  It's a grind. And for me, [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6108.0s)]
*  for my mental health, [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6110.0s)]
*  man, I am not the same person if I don't [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6112.0s)]
*  exercise. You know, with that whole thing [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6114.0s)]
*  with like 100% the frequencies. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6116.0s)]
*  My, I'm at my best [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6118.0s)]
*  as a human being, as a friend, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6120.0s)]
*  as a husband, as a father, as a [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6122.0s)]
*  comedian, as a podcast host, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6124.0s)]
*  as a, just as a neighbor, as a [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6126.0s)]
*  general person. I'm at my best [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6128.0s)]
*  if I work out. Yeah. 100% [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6130.0s)]
*  of the time. I'm less [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6132.0s)]
*  anxious. I don't have any demons. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6134.0s)]
*  Everything's good. I exercise it all [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6136.0s)]
*  out. It's just like, [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6138.0s)]
*  it's like a purge that I have to do. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6140.0s)]
*  I have to do that purge. And if I don't, [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6142.0s)]
*  I don't fucking [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6144.0s)]
*  I don't get that out, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6146.0s)]
*  then I have all this extra [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6148.0s)]
*  like, ah, all this extra [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6150.0s)]
*  unnecessary angst [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6152.0s)]
*  and weirdness. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6154.0s)]
*  And I think that's most people, man. I mean, when I go [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6156.0s)]
*  like, I've been injured before [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6158.0s)]
*  where I couldn't do anything for like a week or [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6160.0s)]
*  two, and you start getting depressed. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6162.0s)]
*  You start feeling like shit. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6164.0s)]
*  You start feeling real dull and sad. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6166.0s)]
*  And like, it's not, and I [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6168.0s)]
*  think that is a lot of people out there that suffer [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6170.0s)]
*  from depression. In fact, they say that [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6172.0s)]
*  exercise is [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6174.0s)]
*  one and a half times more effective [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6176.0s)]
*  than SSRIs for curing depression. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6178.0s)]
*  Oh, in a heartbeat, man. I'll take, if I [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6180.0s)]
*  take my, cause I take SSRIs and I [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6182.0s)]
*  do exercise. If I take my SSRI, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6184.0s)]
*  I don't feel really anything. I just feel like, [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6186.0s)]
*  oh, I took my SSRI. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6188.0s)]
*  But if I go for a run, like even today, I had to go run [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6190.0s)]
*  a couple miles. I was like, I know I'm gonna be on here. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6192.0s)]
*  I wanna have [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6194.0s)]
*  I wanna like, just be in like my [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6196.0s)]
*  I wanna have my good energy going. I'm gonna go for [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6198.0s)]
*  a run, you know? And so [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6200.0s)]
*  yeah, I think it [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6202.0s)]
*  I know that it makes me feel better if I [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6204.0s)]
*  do something athletic, you know? [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6206.0s)]
*  What SSRI are you taking? I think I'm a [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6208.0s)]
*  Lexapro right now. I take the generic one, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6210.0s)]
*  whatever the cheaper one is. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6212.0s)]
*  You know, I think it's um [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6214.0s)]
*  I don't know what it is, but it is [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6216.0s)]
*  they say it's [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6218.0s)]
*  fine. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6220.0s)]
*  You know? So I don't know if I [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6224.0s)]
*  believe them, but I mean I'm fucking taking it. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6226.0s)]
*  Now I would like to take, I would like to maybe [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6228.0s)]
*  take 30 days off and try [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6230.0s)]
*  Ayahuasca again. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6232.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm getting back around where [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6234.0s)]
*  I would like to do it again, you know? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6236.0s)]
*  Yeah? Yeah. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6238.0s)]
*  I would, man. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6240.0s)]
*  Cause I wanna fucking feel, I wanna be right up there [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6242.0s)]
*  on nature's fucking [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6244.0s)]
*  I wanna be in there. Eavesdropping on nature's [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6246.0s)]
*  nuts, boy. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6248.0s)]
*  God, I'll be right up there. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6250.0s)]
*  What'd you say, boy? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6252.0s)]
*  Eavesdropping on nature. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6254.0s)]
*  Right up next to it. Oh, dude. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6256.0s)]
*  Oh, Ayahuasca, dude. You'll fucking [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6258.0s)]
*  Mother Nature, you'll be [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6260.0s)]
*  she'll break out that wiener and you'll be like [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6262.0s)]
*  damn, I didn't know Mother Nature had a wiener, you know? [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6264.0s)]
*  Mother Nature's got everything. It's powerful, dude. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6266.0s)]
*  That Ayahuasca stuff is real powerful. So I would like to do that again. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6268.0s)]
*  What is [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6270.0s)]
*  the reason why you take the SSRIs? [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6272.0s)]
*  I think cause when I'm off [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6274.0s)]
*  of them, something [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6276.0s)]
*  feels wrong. I feel [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6278.0s)]
*  it's a battle. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6282.0s)]
*  A battle. It's a battle to [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6284.0s)]
*  even if I do running and I do fitness, [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6286.0s)]
*  right, it's a battle to keep myself [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6288.0s)]
*  even. So [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6290.0s)]
*  instead of dealing with that [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6292.0s)]
*  at a more [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6294.0s)]
*  intense level, I choose to take [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6296.0s)]
*  them because it just makes it a little bit easier. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6298.0s)]
*  I don't think it's taking the easy way out though [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6300.0s)]
*  because [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6302.0s)]
*  if I don't take them and I still do all those things, [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6304.0s)]
*  it's hard for me to get to a good baseline. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6306.0s)]
*  What do you mean by wrong? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6308.0s)]
*  When you say you feel wrong, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6310.0s)]
*  what does it feel like? [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6312.0s)]
*  I feel like at any moment [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6314.0s)]
*  kind of my feelings can just drop [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6316.0s)]
*  off into like a really surprised [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6318.0s)]
*  low. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6320.0s)]
*  Out of nowhere, for no reason. Yes. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6322.0s)]
*  Sometimes with a little bit of motivation [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6324.0s)]
*  to it, right, or some trigger. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6326.0s)]
*  But the level [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6328.0s)]
*  that it drops off to, it's too [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6330.0s)]
*  much of a drop [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6332.0s)]
*  for me to not get some help. If it were a little [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6334.0s)]
*  bit and it felt manageable, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6336.0s)]
*  that's okay. But when it's [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6338.0s)]
*  pretty steep, it's like, oh man, this feels [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6340.0s)]
*  sometimes scary. Yeah, I know [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6342.0s)]
*  what you're saying. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6344.0s)]
*  But it's gotten [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6346.0s)]
*  doing that ayahuasca stuff made it [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6348.0s)]
*  a lot [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6350.0s)]
*  better than it had ever been. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6352.0s)]
*  Brennan said it basically [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6354.0s)]
*  cured him. Yeah, he's the one who took [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6356.0s)]
*  me to it. Yeah, he said [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6358.0s)]
*  it made him much happier. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6360.0s)]
*  It cured him of [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6362.0s)]
*  a lot of what he felt like were [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6364.0s)]
*  personality disorders that he had. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6366.0s)]
*  You know? Like, Neil's [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6368.0s)]
*  a great guy. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6370.0s)]
*  But he's very, very smart. Very smart. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6372.0s)]
*  And sometimes, you know, I wonder [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6374.0s)]
*  about real smart guys that are just always [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6376.0s)]
*  thinking about things and maybe too much [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6378.0s)]
*  about certain things. And you [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6380.0s)]
*  know, you just get overwhelmed by thoughts [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6382.0s)]
*  and anxiety and emotions. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6384.0s)]
*  And anxiety is a lot of what [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6386.0s)]
*  anxiety is a lot of is fretting [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6388.0s)]
*  about possibilities for a lot [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6390.0s)]
*  of people. You know, it's the inability [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6392.0s)]
*  to live in the moment. And you fret [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6394.0s)]
*  about anxiety. And a lot of it has to do with childhood [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6396.0s)]
*  trauma. A lot of it has to do with genetics. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6398.0s)]
*  Anxiety is a weird thing. Like, they [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6400.0s)]
*  think that anxiety, whether it's a learned behavior [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6402.0s)]
*  or not, you can actually [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6404.0s)]
*  get it from your parents. I don't know why. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6406.0s)]
*  See, what's the... I could see that. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6408.0s)]
*  Can you get anxiety? Is anxiety [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6410.0s)]
*  genetic? Google that. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6412.0s)]
*  My mom made us anxious. Yeah? Yeah, dude. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6414.0s)]
*  Sometimes my mom, we'd go get ice cream, dude. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6416.0s)]
*  And she would like, she's like, [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6418.0s)]
*  she'd get angry if we [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6420.0s)]
*  she'd get so angry if we dripped any of it. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6422.0s)]
*  Here it goes. There's clear research [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6424.0s)]
*  showing that anxiety is influenced by [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6426.0s)]
*  genetics. In fact, experts [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6428.0s)]
*  notice a family connection for anxiety [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6430.0s)]
*  even before they understood how DNA or genes [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6432.0s)]
*  work. If you have a close relative with anxiety, [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6434.0s)]
*  your chance of developing is about two to [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6436.0s)]
*  six times higher than if you don't. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6438.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know if that's genetic or if it's just like [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6440.0s)]
*  Learned behavior. Yeah, if your mom [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6442.0s)]
*  is always or your dad is always like [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6444.0s)]
*  they're fucking anxious and [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6446.0s)]
*  they come over and they're always fucking tickling [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6448.0s)]
*  you, then you're gonna fucking feel tickled [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6450.0s)]
*  all the time. If you're always getting fucked with. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6452.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, something, you know, bugging you or [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6454.0s)]
*  something, even just tickling you with their words. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6456.0s)]
*  Yeah, genetics of generalized [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6458.0s)]
*  anxiety disorder and related [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6460.0s)]
*  traits. Well, for sure, mental [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6462.0s)]
*  illness is genetic. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6464.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people that are mentally [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6466.0s)]
*  ill and their children are mentally ill or their [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6468.0s)]
*  family's mentally ill or, you know, it's like [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6470.0s)]
*  it's...man, [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6472.0s)]
*  I used to have a much more [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6474.0s)]
*  ignorant [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6476.0s)]
*  view on mental health [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6478.0s)]
*  because I have my own [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6480.0s)]
*  mental health issues, which I'm sure [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6482.0s)]
*  we all do, but mine was like, just don't be a [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6484.0s)]
*  pussy. Get your work done, you feel [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6486.0s)]
*  great. And I don't have to take anything [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6488.0s)]
*  and even though I don't have to take anything, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6490.0s)]
*  I'm still doing something to mitigate [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6492.0s)]
*  it. I'm doing something every day to work [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6494.0s)]
*  on it. And when I don't, I do feel it. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6496.0s)]
*  Right. Like a lot of people do. So I always wonder, [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6498.0s)]
*  maybe those people just aren't doing the work. Maybe [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6500.0s)]
*  if they just got up in the morning, went running before [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6502.0s)]
*  work or did something before, maybe they could get through [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6504.0s)]
*  this and not need a fucking [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6506.0s)]
*  pill. Yeah. I don't think that [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6508.0s)]
*  anymore. Interesting. Yeah, I think [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6510.0s)]
*  it's...I think, yeah, there's times [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6512.0s)]
*  where I thought that I'm just not tough enough. I'm [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6514.0s)]
*  just not doing enough. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6516.0s)]
*  I'm not enough to [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6518.0s)]
*  battle this, right? Right. Right. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6520.0s)]
*  And then I get to a point [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6522.0s)]
*  where so many times I tried to stop [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6524.0s)]
*  taking it and it's like it's too much of a [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6526.0s)]
*  discrepancy that makes [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6528.0s)]
*  things unmanageable to a point where [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6530.0s)]
*  it feels like it's unfair to be that unmanageable [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6532.0s)]
*  to myself. So [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6534.0s)]
*  I get back on it, you know, [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6536.0s)]
*  and I don't think it really bothers [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6538.0s)]
*  me or anything like that, but [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6540.0s)]
*  yeah, it's kind of the same with alcoholism. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6542.0s)]
*  Like I thought alcoholism used to just [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6544.0s)]
*  be like somebody [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6546.0s)]
*  couldn't stop drinking or whatever. Right. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6548.0s)]
*  But there's so much more. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6550.0s)]
*  I mean, alcoholism is only disease that will tell [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6552.0s)]
*  you you don't have the disease, right? [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6554.0s)]
*  That's crap. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6556.0s)]
*  Like imagine if you put on like [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6558.0s)]
*  a shirt, right? [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6560.0s)]
*  But every couple days a shirt [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6562.0s)]
*  was like, guess what? You don't have a [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6564.0s)]
*  shirt on. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6566.0s)]
*  I don't [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6568.0s)]
*  think...that's a good analogy. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6570.0s)]
*  I don't know if it is, but [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6572.0s)]
*  it seems like it...but that's [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6574.0s)]
*  what alcoholism...because alcoholism would tell [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6576.0s)]
*  you you don't have a problem. Right. You don't [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6578.0s)]
*  have a problem. Have another drink. Yeah. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6580.0s)]
*  Relax. Have another coke. Have [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6582.0s)]
*  some more coke. Bump. Yeah. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6584.0s)]
*  Have another family. Woo! [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6586.0s)]
*  Woo! Yeah. Yeah. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6588.0s)]
*  Brian Simpson was telling us he went through a brief period [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6590.0s)]
*  of time where he was doing a lot of Adderall. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6592.0s)]
*  And he said, like a week, [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6594.0s)]
*  he said he did a week of Adderall. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6596.0s)]
*  And he said, man, he's [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6598.0s)]
*  like, that shit, that shit [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6600.0s)]
*  pulls you in. Really? He said that? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6602.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. He's like, that shit pulls you in. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6604.0s)]
*  He goes, it makes you focus. He told this fucking [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6606.0s)]
*  hilarious story about he went to Jerkoff [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6608.0s)]
*  and he had [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6610.0s)]
*  90 tabs open and he was [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6612.0s)]
*  looking at porn for five [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6614.0s)]
*  hours because he couldn't pick one that he [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6616.0s)]
*  liked the best. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6618.0s)]
*  I was like, you gotta [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6620.0s)]
*  talk about that on stage. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6622.0s)]

*  great. He is so funny. His way of [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6628.0s)]
*  looking at things is so interesting because [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6630.0s)]

*  again is exciting, you know? Yeah. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6950.0s)]
*  Well, this town has really [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6952.0s)]
*  embraced it, you know, because it was [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6954.0s)]
*  a long time that I was, you know, [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6956.0s)]
*  us moving here was a big deal. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6958.0s)]
*  There's a lot of articles written like this standup comedy [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6960.0s)]
*  has moved to Austin. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6962.0s)]
*  And then when [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6964.0s)]
*  I said I was going to open up a club, there was like [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6966.0s)]
*  a lot of hype about that. And it was almost better [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6968.0s)]
*  that the first place didn't work out because [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6970.0s)]
*  it took so long before [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6972.0s)]
*  we bought the second place and then [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6974.0s)]
*  started construction. It was a whole year process [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6976.0s)]
*  after that. It was a lot going [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6978.0s)]
*  on. It's like a year and a half of just [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6980.0s)]
*  straight construction. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6982.0s)]
*  Did you feel at some point [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6984.0s)]
*  like, was there ever a point where you were like, I don't know if this is [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6986.0s)]
*  going to work out, but I've already said it's going to [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6988.0s)]
*  so I have to do it? No. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6990.0s)]
*  No, because fortunately [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6992.0s)]
*  I had the resources. So it [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6994.0s)]
*  wasn't like, if I was stressed out financially and it was like I was like cutting it close, that would have been a different experience. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=6996.0s)]
*  This experience was like, what do we got to do? [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7004.0s)]
*  Okay, let's do that. What's the best thing to do? Do that. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7006.0s)]
*  You know, like when Louis came, Louis CK came and I showed him the club and he fucking loved it, but he gave me all these good suggestions. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7010.0s)]
*  One of the things he said, the stage in the small room was too big. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7017.0s)]
*  And he was like, you're right. He's like, yeah, you cut it down like four feet on each side. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7021.0s)]
*  So I got the construction guys over here, before we poured the cement, so all the rebar was cut, the metal was in place. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7024.0s)]
*  And I was like, let's make it smaller. Cut it here and cut it there. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7029.0s)]
*  And they're like, well, is it going to take more time? [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7031.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, but we got to do it right. Let's do it right. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7033.0s)]
*  Lower the ceiling, shrink the stage, lower the ceiling in the big room, sound editing everywhere. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7035.0s)]
*  Because like a lot of comics like, they like echo in a comic club because it makes the laughs louder. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7040.0s)]
*  But it also makes it harder to hear what the person's saying because all the sounds bouncing around. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7046.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like that. I like it with carpet or, you know, like [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7050.0s)]
*  as much can be absorbed. That's what you want. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7053.0s)]
*  Yeah. What we got now is perfect. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7056.0s)]
*  Yeah. Louie's awesome, man. Louie, Louie came on my podcast and we had one of the best chats I've ever had with somebody. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7058.0s)]
*  You told me that the YouTube removed your RFK podcast. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7064.0s)]
*  Yeah. What happened? [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7069.0s)]
*  They, yeah, they said some of the clips were in violation of their medical policies or like, [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7071.0s)]
*  like stuff that goes against the WHO. Right. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7079.0s)]
*  Do you know that North Korea just joined the WHO? [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7084.0s)]
*  North Korea has like an executive position on the board of the WHO. See what that is, which is insane. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7087.0s)]
*  Yeah. This is literally a country that starves their citizens and the WHO is allowing them. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7093.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just what is the WHO? What the fuck? [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7099.0s)]
*  You tell me that Robert, Robert Kennedy Jr. is lying because I bet he's not. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7103.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7107.0s)]
*  I bet everything he said is true. I bet everything he said could be backed up by data. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7108.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, one thing that I love about Bobby or Robert Kennedy, he's a friend of mine and I've always really, he's an environmentalist, right? [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7113.0s)]
*  And so he's always started. He was an environmentalist. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7124.0s)]
*  Environmentalist. So it makes sense that he would care about the environment inside of our bodies as well, right? [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7126.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7131.0s)]
*  Like he has this River Keepers organization. They're just about keeping the waters clean and his whole life has been about that kind of stuff. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7132.0s)]
*  So I don't know. I found it just like, yeah, if somebody wants to object to the status quo or raise their hand and ask questions, that makes perfect sense to me. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7138.0s)]
*  And then also he's not like an anti-vaxxer, but he's about like vaccine efficacy, right? Which means I think like. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7150.0s)]
*  It's about honest vaccine efficacy. Like what is the, what's the real data versus what are they selling you? [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7156.0s)]
*  Because if you look at the COVID vaccine, for example, they sold us something that wasn't accurate. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7162.0s)]
*  They said that it was going to stop transmission. They said that it was going to stop infection. It did neither of those things. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7167.0s)]
*  They also said that it was going to offer long lasting protection. It did not. It just didn't. And they said that it was safe and effective. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7172.0s)]
*  How can they know that it's a new product and you're administering it to hundreds of millions of people without a lengthy trial period like they do with every other drug. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7180.0s)]
*  So all these people were like wanting it to be effective. So they were doing the work of the pharmaceutical companies, which they've never done before. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7188.0s)]
*  No one has ever like said, you've got to trust these people that have the biggest fucking criminal fines in U.S. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7196.0s)]
*  history. These people that have been lying to us left and right, these people that have they've been tried and convicted for lying about the side effects for lying about the efficacy, whether or not something is addictive. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7202.0s)]
*  We know that with the opioid crisis. Oh, yeah. You watch Dope Sick for I mean, that's unbelievable. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7214.0s)]
*  You get involved. It's unbelievable what's happened with all of that. Yeah, this is the Sackler family just got they just they had to give. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7219.0s)]
*  I think it was like a large payment. I think it was like six or eight billion dollars. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7229.0s)]
*  And that gives them immunity. That was very recent. See if you can find that. But that's fucking nothing. Sackler family wins immunity from opioid lawsuits, which is fucking wild. Unreal. Six billion. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7235.0s)]
*  So what about all the people that fucking died? What about all the fucking kids that overdose? What about all the families who had a child who sprained their fucking ankle? Right. And lost their and two years later lost their kid to addiction. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7249.0s)]
*  Yeah, because this company didn't care. And because the FDA was compromisable. I'm sorry, man. That shit fucking makes me. I think these people should be fucking hung. It's evil. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7262.0s)]
*  And they live. That's what it is. They absolutely lied about whether or not was addiction addictive in exchange. They will pay six billion to help address opioid addiction. What does that even what does that mean? What does that mean? How are you going to address it? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7272.0s)]
*  Hey, guys, opioids are addictive. Who knows? Yeah, yeah, man. That's the payments will be spread over multiple years. But look at how much they made. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7285.0s)]
*  See, the thing is they've they're collectively worth 11 billion and they had to give up six. So how much money did they make off of opiates? See, that's the thing that happened with Vioxx with Vioxx. They got in trouble. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7295.0s)]
*  What is it? Vioxx is an anti inflammatory that didn't particularly work very well and also killed a bunch of people killed at least 50,000 Americans cost a friend of mine got a stroke from it. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7311.0s)]
*  It caused all these issues with people. They were aware of it as internal documents that showed that it was going to be a problem. They knew it was going to be a problem. But in the internal documents, they said, but we think we will do very well with this. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7322.0s)]
*  Wow. So they did very well financially. I think they made something like 12 billion off of Vioxx and they had to give up five. So they got a fine of five billion. But that means they had all that profit. That's a lot. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7333.0s)]
*  That's it's sick. When did when did that start to happen in our in our in our in our country? When did it start to happen that there's that we're not protecting our people? Like when did that? Is that like profit? It's all profit. If there was no money in this, they would go after those folks. 100%. There's money. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7346.0s)]
*  When did it happen in our time in existence of time? Was there a point where that wasn't the way of the thing? Well, here's the first problem. Advertising for pharmaceutical drugs on television. Yeah. Advertising for pharmaceutical drugs is illegal in every country in the world except for New Zealand and the United States. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7368.0s)]
*  You shouldn't be able to influence people to want to take these drugs that they may or may not need. That should be entirely a conversation between you and your health care provider. Someone should be giving you an educated understanding of what the pros and cons are. And this is why I think you need this. And this is why you should take that. It shouldn't be you coming to your doctor. Ask your doctor if lalala is right for you. Do you have days or blah, blah, blah? Do you have that? Well, a lot of people are going to be like, oh, I'm going to be a doctor. I'm going to be a doctor. I'm going to be a doctor. I'm going to be a doctor. I'm going to be a doctor. I'm going to be a doctor. I'm going to be a doctor. I'm going to be a doctor. I'm going to be a doctor. I'm going to be a doctor. I'm going to be a doctor. I'm going to be a doctor.

*  it's one thing if you're advertising for a nice pair of shoes or something like [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7461.32s)]
*  that I don't find any problem with that it makes people want them but what's the [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7464.28s)]

*  got released today I remember you know I grew up in an environment where Tulane [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7672.5599999999995s)]
*  University I told you this before they had their primate testing facility in [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7678.679999999999s)]
*  our town right yeah and a bunch of chimps got out once and we got to help [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7681.88s)]

*  that's where they tested the code they are the polio vaccine right that's where [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7690.84s)]
*  they made it and it caused cancer in a lot of women like in their cervical [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7695.04s)]
*  cancer I believe but they'd already made it and they're like it'll cure it'll [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7701.68s)]
*  stop polio but some women will get service so they just released it did you [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7706.8s)]
*  know that polio 95% of people get polio it's asymptomatic so what does that [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7711.8s)]
*  mean reading this book about this that might not be true so I need to make sure [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7719.32s)]
*  that this book is accurate but what they're basically saying in this book is [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7723.36s)]
*  that a lot of the cases of polio that we talk about from back in the day [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7726.639999999999s)]
*  DDT was in widespread use back then widespread use as a pesticide and they [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7732.5599999999995s)]
*  were using DDT to kill bugs that they thought carried diseases but the problem [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7740.68s)]
*  is DDT exposure is insanely toxic now we know that now DDT they don't use it [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7745.8s)]
*  anymore in America yeah but they still use it in other countries where polio [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7751.96s)]
*  like symptoms are very prevalent one of the side effects one of the effects of [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7755.4400000000005s)]
*  DDT poisoning is polio like symptoms I think it's called encephalopathy [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7759.72s)]
*  see what that is DDT side effects we didn't have a lot of polio I don't [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7767.24s)]
*  think in our area well polio was something that was going on in the early [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7774.24s)]
*  part of the 20th century you know and it's widely credited at the polio [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7780.16s)]
*  vaccine is what stopped that I used to wholesale believe that until this [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7784.22s)]
*  pandemic and now I question everything now I'm like I don't know I don't know [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7791.72s)]
*  what the truth is with whether it's smallpox or polio I have a feeling that [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7795.48s)]
*  there's a lot more to the story than what the general narrative is that we've [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7800.72s)]
*  been given this had vaccines are this amazing cure I think there's a lot of [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7805.4400000000005s)]
*  other factors and I think one of the other factors was hygiene and it's the [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7809.240000000001s)]
*  book is called dissolving illusions and it's all about the origins of vaccines [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7813.08s)]
*  and what vaccines have done to you know stop disease spread and what the [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7817.68s)]
*  negative side effects have been and it's just like there's a lot of negative [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7823.6s)]
*  side effects man and to pretend that it's safe and effective like when you're [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7826.76s)]
*  administering things to millions if not hundreds of millions of people like [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7831.400000000001s)]
*  there's gonna be some problems and they don't want to advertise those problems [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7835.76s)]
*  and yeah they don't want to make those problems publicly known oh yeah yeah you [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=7841.0s)]

*  because there's so many people there they're like they say that if you're in a crowded area and [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=9273.86s)]

*  responsibility so many people but if it was just you and another person that person was getting [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=9291.7s)]

*  pain and if used correctly there's not an issue but it's an incredibly dangerous drug and it's [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=9319.74s)]

*  problem is that first of all the media is overwhelmingly left-leaning and if you have a [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=9743.5s)]
*  left-leaning politician or a left-wing Democratic politician and then you have this media that [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=9748.54s)]
*  essentially works to support that person I mean they ignore any information that leads to [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=9754.7s)]
*  distrust in the government or distrust in this administration or distrust in this this party [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=9761.26s)]

*  political money right so then it would start to affect the bottom lines of companies so then [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=9788.42s)]
*  those companies would stop because I think you have to get a little that's going on right now [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGPC18DTPdo&t=9794.86s)]
