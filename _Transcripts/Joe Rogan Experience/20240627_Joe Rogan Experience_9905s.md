# Joe Rogan Experience #2070 - Evan Hafer
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5.8s)]
*  As far as like the cage fighting commentators. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=12.44s)]
*  That's what you're classifying yourself as. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=16.56s)]
*  Yeah, pothead comedian slash cage fighting commentator. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=18.04s)]
*  Cage fighting commentator. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=21.44s)]
*  I got a pretty solid IQ for that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=22.44s)]
*  No, that's great. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=24.92s)]
*  You said it was the average, there's 16% of America that has below 85 IQ. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=25.92s)]
*  Correct. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=33.64s)]
*  So that's the cutoff for military service. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=34.64s)]
*  You can't take somebody in. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=38.44s)]
*  This is the kind of talk that started Hitler off. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=39.44s)]
*  It's like when they start getting some master race. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=41.44s)]
*  They're like eugenics. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Because you know, like, I would never ever say that people shouldn't breed. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  I would never say anything like that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=53.160000000000004s)]
*  I would never. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=54.44s)]
*  If we were in Elk honeycomb, I'd tell you that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=55.96s)]
*  But publicly, I would never say that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=62.68s)]
*  You would never say it on this podcast. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=66.48s)]
*  I mean, here's the thing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=67.48s)]
*  I don't know what my parents IQs were. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=68.48s)]
*  What if my parents were, you know, like, what if they got IQs and their IQ tests were really [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=70.96s)]
*  low? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  But I mean, isn't it possible that someone who's not that bright has a super smart kid, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  like they give him enough vaccines and the kid comes out a genius? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=83.24s)]
*  I hope that's the case for my kids. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  God, I hope so. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=88.8s)]
*  I hope they got a little bit more than I do. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=91.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  Life's hard when you're stupid. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  It's so hard when you're dumb. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  God. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=99.56s)]
*  I've had conversations with dudes and like halfway in the conversation, I'm like, this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=100.56s)]

*  It's like you're at VO2 Max and he hasn't even like stepped off the curb. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=127.2s)]
*  He's sweating. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=131.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=132.72s)]
*  He's like, let me explain this to you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=133.72s)]
*  He got out the crayons and drew me some pictures. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=135.32s)]
*  Fucking works. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=138.4s)]
*  Dude, he literally wrote. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=139.4s)]
*  I don't even know if it's been disproven. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=141.64s)]
*  See, this is the thing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  The stuff that he discusses is so complex that there's only like what, what are the, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  what's the amount of people in the world that could even argue with him about it? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=149.84s)]
*  But he wrote it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=153.28s)]
*  He wrote a theory of everything. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=154.28s)]
*  The theory of everything. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=156.68s)]
*  And he announced it on this podcast. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=157.68s)]
*  He like published this theory and he's putting it out there for people to judge. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=160.2s)]
*  And I don't know how it's been received. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=164.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=166.24s)]
*  How would I know? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=167.88s)]
*  I mean, I would never understand who's like one of the things that I've learned during [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=168.88s)]
*  COVID this whole trust the experts thing, suck my dick. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=173.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=177.0s)]
*  That's nonsense. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=178.0s)]
*  There's a lot of these people that are fucking foolish shit and bought and paid for. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=179.0s)]
*  And I don't trust just the experts anymore. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=184.0s)]
*  I trust some experts. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=187.08s)]
*  I trust if I can understand what they're talking about and I know where maybe their conflicts [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  lie, I can see, well, why would they be ignoring certain studies but highlighting others? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=195.16s)]
*  Oh, there's a conflict of interest. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=200.24s)]
*  Oh, there's some money involved. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=202.04s)]
*  Oh, maybe there's a revolving door and they can get into some nice agency or some corporation [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=203.72s)]
*  after they're done with the agency. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=209.12s)]
*  I can kind of look at that, but it takes time with this shit. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=211.2s)]
*  When he's talking about, I have no idea who the experts are. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=217.12s)]
*  I have no idea what he's literally talking about a theory of everything. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=219.92s)]
*  And it was Brian Callan and me and it was a wild conversation because- [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  Did she even get to talk? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=230.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=231.16s)]
*  With Brian Callan and Eric Weinstadt? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=232.16s)]
*  How much did you get to talk? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=234.16s)]
*  I got to talk like 10% of the time, which I felt- [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=235.76s)]
*  That's a solid number. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=239.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's a solid number. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=240.56s)]
*  I showed up. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=241.56s)]
*  I got up to bat. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=242.56s)]
*  I can't say I ever hit the ball, but I was at least participating. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=244.76s)]
*  Dude, I had conversations with Jordan Peterson where we've had a three and a half hour conversation. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  I've talked for three minutes. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=252.56s)]
*  Now, that does not surprise me at all because he can go. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=254.2s)]
*  He can go. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=261.2s)]
*  That guy can go. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=262.2s)]
*  He can go. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=263.2s)]
*  Have you watched those, the monk debates with him? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=264.2s)]
*  Yes, yes I did. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=266.8s)]
*  Those are incredible. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=267.8s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=268.8s)]
*  Him and Malcolm Gladwell, that debate when he- [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=269.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=274.56s)]
*  Douglas Murray, Jordan Peterson, that thing was so good because I just love watching those [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=275.56s)]
*  guys intellectually eviscerate people because it's hilarious to me. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=281.8s)]
*  I do, but it becomes a bit of an intellectual rap battle. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  That's what I don't like about it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=290.8s)]
*  I just feel like it's beneath those guys. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=293.6s)]
*  When I see guys like Malcolm dunking on people, I'm like, shouldn't we just be discussing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=296.48s)]
*  the data? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  Instead of trying to invoke an emotional response from someone. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=306.72s)]
*  I understand why you would do that if you were fucking with someone, if you wanted to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=310.76000000000005s)]
*  have an argument with someone. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=313.76000000000005s)]
*  What is this publicly for? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=316.36s)]
*  Why is it public? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=318.44000000000005s)]
*  Well, it's public because we're trying to understand who's right and who's wrong. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=319.44000000000005s)]
*  I want to know why you think the way you think. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=322.24s)]
*  There's clearly many different schools of thought when it comes to many cultural things [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  and people are fiercely opposed to the other side. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  I want to know where you're coming from. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  If you're dunking on people, now I do know where you're coming from. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=338.04s)]
*  First of all, it's not funny. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=339.36s)]
*  If you're going to do it, be good at it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=341.36s)]
*  Be fucking funny. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=343.88s)]
*  Also, it's not necessary to this argument, this discussion. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=345.16s)]
*  You should really be talking about why you really believe what you believe and what you [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=349.56s)]
*  think is wrong with this opposing opinion. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=354.68s)]
*  Not just being silly. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=357.56s)]
*  I love the debate stage. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=360.12s)]
*  I love that forum for two people to take a topic. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=363.8s)]
*  I used to watch debates. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=367.2s)]
*  I think PBS used to do a series on just they take one topic and they chew it up and they [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=369.8s)]
*  figure out where is the crowd before and then where was the crowd after. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=375.96s)]
*  They're fascinating because when people are going from opposing points, they're going [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=379.8s)]
*  back and forth if they stick to facts and they don't get personal because that's when [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=383.64s)]
*  it actually starts to get like really now you're just kind of being personal. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=387.76s)]
*  You're degrading the actual conversation. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=392.84s)]
*  You're not going. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=394.64s)]
*  It's not a fight. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=395.86s)]
*  It's not like from my perspective, you look at it, it's kind of like watching a match [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=397.04s)]
*  where you're watching two guys go back and forth hit for hit. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  Seeing guys like Jordan and Douglas Murray or some of those guys really flex, it's pretty [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  funny to me. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=417.92s)]
*  Sam Harris is the goat at that when it comes to religious debates. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=418.92s)]
*  That guy's the best at that shit. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=424.76s)]
*  He has this measured tone and he never loses his cool and he has so much fucking information. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=426.4s)]
*  That's when I became a fan of his, is watching those religious debates. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=432.88s)]
*  Sometimes when people believe a thing so much, they haven't ever looked at the thing the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  way someone who doesn't believe in the thing looks at it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=445.76s)]
*  When you get a guy like Sam who's so eloquent and is not buying it and he has a bunch of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=449.52s)]
*  logical reasons why he's not buying it, some of them are pretty funny. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=456.44s)]
*  When he brings those up in front of you and then the audience is laughing, it's like, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=460.8s)]
*  ooh, this is a tough spot to be in because they're trying to pull out all the stops and [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=465.24s)]
*  trying to figure out why you're right. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=469.88s)]
*  When you got that much power to not only debate somebody on a subject with an encyclopedia [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=471.76s)]
*  of information and be funny so you can be charismatic, you can be logical, you can keep [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=478.12s)]
*  a measured tone, that guy's pretty fucking skilled. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=484.76000000000005s)]
*  Oh, he's a wizard at that shit. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=488.44000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=490.24s)]
*  He's a wizard at that shit. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=491.24s)]
*  But it's a game. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=492.24s)]
*  It's like jujitsu. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=495.24s)]
*  It's like chess. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=496.24s)]
*  It's like you're playing this game. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=497.24s)]
*  There's a bunch of moves and trying to figure out who can get their moves off. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=498.24s)]
*  But I think people genuinely want to know, did you ever see that movie, there's a documentary [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=503.04s)]
*  about, God, what was it called? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=511.35999999999996s)]
*  The one about Gore Vidal and the, what's that guy? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=516.76s)]
*  The Best of Enemies? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=521.64s)]
*  Yes, Best of Enemies. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=522.64s)]
*  No, I haven't seen it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=523.64s)]
*  Gore Vidal and, what's the fucking other guy's name? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=524.64s)]
*  I always forget his name. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=526.0799999999999s)]
*  William Buckley. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=527.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, William Buckley. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  So Buckley's the conservative and Gore Vidal is the, and they aired these, I think it was [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=529.0799999999999s)]
*  on NBC, is that what it was on? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=534.28s)]
*  ABC or NBC? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=536.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  But it got huge ratings. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=538.4399999999999s)]
*  They were losing in the ratings and this was kind of a Hail Mary. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=540.92s)]
*  Have William F. Buckley as the leading conservative and Gore Vidal who's this wild liberal. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=544.4799999999999s)]
*  And so they were on, moderated on ABC? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=550.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=554.4s)]
*  ABC, news coverage of the Republican National Convention in Miami. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=555.4s)]
*  So this is 1968. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=559.16s)]
*  They're fucking great, man. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=560.16s)]
*  Because one of the things that people are knowing through, learning through podcasts [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=562.7199999999999s)]
*  Eric Weinstein or guys like Jordan Peterson or Sam Harrison. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=567.6s)]
*  People want to hear people talk. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=571.96s)]
*  For the one, there's the people that are above that 85 IQ. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=574.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, what is it? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=580.52s)]
*  84% of the population? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=581.52s)]
*  The people that are above those fucking people want, they want to hear how interesting, intelligent [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=582.52s)]
*  people are discussing ideas. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=588.28s)]
*  And you don't see any of that shit on TV, except Bill Marshall. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  But even Bill Marshall, there's a lot of people talking over each other. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=594.52s)]
*  It's got to, it's an hour. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=597.68s)]
*  Everything's got to fit in an hour. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=599.6s)]
*  It's on HBO, which is why I think he's doing his own show. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=600.6s)]
*  He's doing his own podcast. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=604.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's like after dark or something. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=605.16s)]
*  Club Random. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=607.48s)]
*  Yeah, okay, there we go. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=608.48s)]
*  It's very good. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=609.48s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=610.48s)]
*  It's very good. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=611.48s)]
*  And he's really himself in that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=612.48s)]
*  Like the Bill Mar- if you want to chill with Bill and have a drink, he really does a fantastic [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=613.48s)]
*  job of just being himself. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=618.0s)]
*  It's not, it's not interesting when you, when you think about Bill Mar and his, you know, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=620.16s)]
*  his kind of outward appearance from his political point of view, which is typically going to [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=625.28s)]
*  be left. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=630.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=631.4s)]
*  And then guys that go on a show and they have this really complex, interesting conversation. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=632.4s)]
*  But for, for a bunch of people, they won't even watch Bill because he's left. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=638.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=643.36s)]
*  They won't even watch. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=644.36s)]
*  So they're going to stick in their echo chamber. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=645.36s)]
*  They're going to continue to kind of propagate out speaking points from either platform. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=646.76s)]
*  And they're never going to go out and watch different things just based on a person's [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=652.28s)]
*  political view. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=656.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=657.2s)]
*  Joining a political party or being in a political party, like ideologically in your head is [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=658.2s)]
*  not good for you. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=662.58s)]
*  It's bad for like, there are a lot of things that people who are on the right believe that [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=663.78s)]
*  I agree with. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=669.3199999999999s)]
*  And there's a lot of things that people on the left believe and I agree with. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  And I refuse. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=674.14s)]
*  I refuse to be a part of this left versus right thing. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=675.64s)]
*  I think it's stupid. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=679.04s)]
*  I think it's bad for us. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=680.6s)]
*  I think it's a trap. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=681.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=682.6s)]
*  I think it's a really dumb trap in America. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=683.6s)]
*  And Bill Maher says a lot of really wise shit and he says a lot of shit about culture that [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=686.06s)]
*  goes against the ideology that he's a part of being. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=692.36s)]
*  He says deep in the Hollywood system as is humanly possible. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=696.68s)]
*  He's a political host on a show on HBO. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=699.84s)]
*  I mean, that's like deep Hollywood. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=703.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=705.44s)]
*  You know, he knows where the sex parties are at. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=706.44s)]
*  Because he's probably the guy sitting in the pit. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=708.76s)]
*  Yeah, he knows who's wearing the goat mask. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=712.64s)]
*  You know, like if there's a fucking Illuminati in Hollywood. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=715.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, you know, he does all these jokes in his monologue about transitioning kids [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=718.84s)]
*  about like, hey, maybe we shouldn't just break out the dick saw right away. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=725.08s)]
*  I'm like, yo, Bill is going for it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=729.12s)]
*  But because he never stopped being a comic, Bill Maher out of all these guys that become [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=732.4s)]
*  hosts of talk shows, he never stopped just being a comic. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=739.12s)]
*  He never stopped touring. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=743.3199999999999s)]
*  He never stopped doing all of his live shows. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=745.06s)]
*  Never stopped being a comic. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=747.98s)]
*  That's what separates Bill. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=749.86s)]
*  Because there's a lot of these guys. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=751.62s)]
*  Look man, you get a job like the host of The Tonight Show or something along those lines [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=753.64s)]
*  that you are fucking set, baby. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=757.6s)]
*  Dude, that is like... [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=759.84s)]
*  Let's go, I'm buying a Ferrari. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=760.84s)]
*  I got a house in Melovin. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=761.84s)]
*  You know, like you're balling out of control and there's a lot of pressure to keep that [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=765.64s)]
*  going and to appease the people that would make those decisions and to also be as marketable [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=772.36s)]
*  as humanly possible to everybody out there in the world so that you can maintain this [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=779.24s)]
*  job. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=782.72s)]
*  So whether or not there's like verbal, why not they sit you down and say, hey, this is [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=783.72s)]
*  what you have to say. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=787.88s)]

*  You're with the vaccine, aren't you Jimmy? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=799.32s)]
*  Like yeah, I'm with the vaccine. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=801.24s)]
*  Like you have to fuck... [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=803.2s)]
*  They don't necessarily sit you down and do that, but you fucking know. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=805.2s)]
*  You fucking know. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=809.24s)]
*  I mean it's unwitting or witting, essentially extortion to a certain degree because you're [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=810.72s)]
*  saying if you don't cooperate, you're going to be on the streets. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=817.66s)]
*  And you're not going to get picked for stuff. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=820.94s)]
*  No. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=822.74s)]
*  Like it's a, but it's a tyranny that like if there's one person or one group that has [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=823.74s)]
*  the overwhelming part of discerning who makes it or who doesn't make it, they have the ability [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=830.42s)]

*  It's not like boxing. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=858.36s)]
*  Like we don't know who the best boxer is. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=859.86s)]

*  Little window of time. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=885.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=886.38s)]
*  Because you got to get in there while you're attractive, your skin still looks good, whatever. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=887.38s)]
*  I mean, I mean, look at those guys. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=891.1400000000001s)]

*  There's a video of him shattering his ankle. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=910.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=912.9799999999999s)]
*  Like that guy, regardless of all the crazy stuff that he said. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=913.9799999999999s)]
*  I think the crazy stuff he says is a good part of it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=918.62s)]
*  You think so? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=920.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=921.78s)]

*  Especially really good ones. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=932.0600000000001s)]

*  it would help. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=937.58s)]
*  It would really help because they can lock into a role in some fucking insane way that [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=938.58s)]
*  you know, like they're crying, screaming and crying. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=945.26s)]

*  It's crazy. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=956.22s)]
*  The ability to do that is nuts. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=958.3s)]
*  And some people just have it. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=960.78s)]
*  And there's a lot of them out there. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=962.3399999999999s)]
*  And I would imagine if you're really good at that, like you don't think Daniel Day-Lewis [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=963.78s)]
*  is crazy. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=967.86s)]

*  that he's done. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=981.14s)]
*  The scenes from There Will Be. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=982.14s)]

*  That might be one of the single greatest scenes in movie history. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=996.14s)]
*  Intense. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1001.2199999999999s)]

*  He's so perfect at that role. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1003.66s)]
*  And the camera angles and the way that they were feeding that to the audience was so fucking [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1006.42s)]
*  brilliant. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1012.54s)]

*  Just everything. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1062.9s)]
*  He just beat that guy to death with a bowling pin. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1063.9s)]
*  And then every little piece of that was put together perfectly from the way that his face [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1065.9s)]
*  was contorted to the level of breathing that he was participating in. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1074.18s)]
*  And then as he falls down, this is just so incredible. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1078.3000000000002s)]
*  What is it? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1081.9s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1095.9s)]
*  I don't remember what he did. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1102.9s)]

*  lifts and pistols all over the wall. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1168.3s)]

*  just an interesting thought exercise to walk yourself through. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1198.3s)]
*  And oh, by the way, if something happens, you also have kind of a group of contingencies [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1202.82s)]
*  that you can operate from. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1207.46s)]

*  I like it when I see that stuff. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1224.72s)]
*  Well, it is a good thing to know. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1226.24s)]
*  You know, Mike Glover is great at that, which got him labeled a terrorist. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1227.8799999999999s)]
*  I think. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1233.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1234.1599999999999s)]
*  Fucking explaining to people how to prepare in case things go sideways. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1235.1599999999999s)]
*  And like you are a problematic individual. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1239.64s)]
*  Yeah, I I don't know how that happened. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1241.84s)]
*  Well, I do know how that happens. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1244.32s)]
*  How did you have? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1245.6s)]
*  I think you have a bunch of people within the federal government that that have a political [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1247.6s)]
*  agenda and or they don't understand. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1253.24s)]
*  They see any and everyone in the country that owns a firearm is some type of threat at some [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1256.76s)]
*  point. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1264.1200000000001s)]
*  They have to be what I would say is familiar with all aspects of America. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1265.76s)]
*  They have to really understand like, hey, there's a group of people out there that prepare [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1272.76s)]
*  for the worst, hope for the best. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1277.1999999999998s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1279.28s)]
*  And they're really into it. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1280.28s)]
*  And just because they're going to the range with a group of friends and they're preparing [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1281.28s)]
*  doesn't make them domestic terrorists. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1285.9599999999998s)]
*  It just makes them prepared. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1288.08s)]
*  Prepared. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1289.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1290.08s)]
*  And here's the thing that I think people should put in their heads. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1291.08s)]
*  Does everybody remember it? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1295.24s)]
*  Let me speak to people that live in Los Angeles, because this is where it gets rare. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1297.28s)]
*  Does everybody remember the lines outside the gun stores? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1301.92s)]
*  Do you remember during the riots, there was lines outside the gun stores? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1305.48s)]
*  Listen to me, kids. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1310.28s)]
*  Keep that energy. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1311.76s)]
*  Keep that energy, because that didn't go away forever. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1313.76s)]
*  That was just a couple of years ago. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1318.1200000000001s)]
*  And the weirdness of life, the weirdness of the way the world works, some shit could pop [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1320.52s)]
*  off anywhere and everywhere. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1326.0s)]
*  That's real. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1328.64s)]
*  That's a real possibility. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1329.92s)]
*  We all saw what just happened in Israel. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1331.88s)]
*  It's a real possibility that some shit could pop off. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1333.76s)]
*  And to bury your head in the sand and pretend that that's not possible, that doesn't help [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1337.16s)]
*  anybody. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1341.04s)]
*  That doesn't help anybody. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1342.04s)]
*  And to prepare? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1343.48s)]
*  Why is preparing bad? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1345.56s)]
*  Do you think that's a part of the cultural differences between people, just in general, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1347.12s)]
*  between red and blue and people? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1355.9599999999998s)]
*  What I would say is the question is there's people that are really individual, they want [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1359.6s)]
*  to take accountability, and there's other people that are like, I want to bury my head [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1365.28s)]
*  in the sand. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1368.1599999999999s)]
*  And I want the government to take care of everything. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1369.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1370.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1371.1599999999999s)]
*  Do you think that's part of it? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1372.1599999999999s)]
*  There's also, there's a weird denial of possibility that comes along with not wanting preparedness. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1373.2s)]
*  And it's one of the rare times when I look at someone like Mike Glover being labeled [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1384.68s)]
*  a terrorist, it's one of the rare times I go, well, there might actually be a conspiracy [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1388.92s)]
*  to keep people weak. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1394.5600000000002s)]
*  They might want to look at people like that as resistance to authoritarianism, and they [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1396.96s)]
*  want to squash that. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1405.0s)]
*  It's one of the rare times where I don't look at it objectively. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1406.68s)]
*  I look at decisions like that, I go, oh, you like weak people, you only want weak people. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1409.68s)]
*  You don't want people to challenge you once you get into power. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1414.52s)]
*  You don't want people to say, hey, that's against the law, or hey, this is not the way [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1416.76s)]
*  we're supposed to be operating. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1421.52s)]
*  You want people to just comply. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1423.04s)]
*  And when no one's armed, people comply. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1425.0s)]
*  And when everyone's armed, it's really hard to get people to comply, especially if they're [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1428.64s)]
*  kind of in agreement. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1432.64s)]
*  If there's a large percentage of us that are in agreement, like, no, you can't listen to [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1433.92s)]
*  all my phone calls. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1440.08s)]
*  You're just a person. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1442.88s)]
*  Whether you work for whatever fucking agency, if I'm a guy who works at a tire shop who [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1443.88s)]
*  doesn't do anything wrong and you want to listen to all my phone calls, what? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1449.16s)]
*  You're just a person. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1452.64s)]
*  Look, if you find a guy who you know is fucking wearing a suicide vest, is about to walk into [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1454.88s)]
*  a wall, you know something's going on, yeah, listen to that guy's phone. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1459.52s)]
*  And if you've got a chain of terrorists that you're studying and you need to listen to [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1463.0800000000002s)]
*  their phones, fuck yeah, listen to their phones. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1466.8000000000002s)]
*  But if a guy just likes to can peaches and he owns a couple of 9mms in an AR, you want [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1469.3600000000001s)]
*  to listen to his phone, hey man, fuck you. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1475.24s)]
*  Did you see where this was last week or maybe the week before last, they were talking about [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1478.6s)]
*  how they had TSA air marshals following people that were in DC, not even at the Capitol, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1484.52s)]
*  but they were in DC during January 6th. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1491.48s)]
*  So they've just been following these people around the United States. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1493.68s)]
*  Have you seen this? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1496.2s)]
*  What? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1497.76s)]
*  Yeah, they were saying they don't have the resources over the Thanksgiving travel period [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1498.76s)]
*  to staff the security needs from the airlines because they had people that were air marshals, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1504.92s)]
*  I believe, and I'm scrolling through this, following people that were just in DC. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1512.5200000000002s)]
*  They weren't even implemented in anything. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1517.68s)]
*  It was wild, dude. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1519.72s)]
*  What are they following for? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1520.96s)]
*  What's the purpose? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1521.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1522.96s)]
*  I think there's a level of intrusiveness in the government that is just, at some point, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1523.96s)]
*  we have to say it's unacceptable. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1530.48s)]
*  I think, I mean, obviously this is a long podcast. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1533.12s)]
*  We don't need to take down the temperature just yet, but I think, man, I don't quite [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1537.84s)]
*  understand why they want that level of surveillance activity around people that quite literally [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1543.8799999999999s)]
*  might have only been in DC during that time period. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1549.4799999999998s)]
*  I think the amount of pressure that they're putting on people to let them know that if [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1552.0s)]
*  there's ever anything like this again, this is what's going to happen. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1560.2s)]
*  Everyone's going to jail. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1566.3200000000002s)]
*  People that shouldn't go to jail are going to jail. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1567.8000000000002s)]
*  If the cops let you in the door and they give you a tour, you're going to jail. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1569.8000000000002s)]
*  We're going to call it a violent insurrection and everyone's going to jail, and we're going [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1574.44s)]
*  to let you in. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1578.68s)]
*  We're going to open up the barricades and we're going to have federal agents in the [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1579.68s)]
*  audience encouraging you to go into the house. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1584.48s)]
*  Then when we're under oath, we're going to say we can't answer whether or not federal [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1588.52s)]
*  agents were inciting people to go into the Capitol. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1592.04s)]
*  How ethically inappropriate do you think everything about that is? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1597.36s)]
*  It's so bad. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1601.8799999999999s)]
*  If this was happening from the right, if this was Trump doing this, people would be losing [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1604.8799999999999s)]
*  their shit. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1609.2s)]
*  Be losing their shit. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1610.2s)]
*  You should be losing your shit if it happens in any political party. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1611.56s)]
*  This is wild. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1615.72s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1617.52s)]
*  I don't know, and I'm not by any stretch of the imagination going to fix it, but I think [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1618.52s)]
*  the Bill of Rights is so important. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1625.04s)]
*  For people to understand what it means and clearly differentiate between, okay, this [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1626.96s)]
*  is states, this is federal. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1632.0s)]
*  Why are these things so important? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1635.16s)]
*  Individual liberty comes with responsibility. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1637.96s)]
*  That's the other piece to this. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1640.8s)]
*  You and I love freedom. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1642.98s)]
*  To be fair, it's quite literally my favorite thing. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1644.88s)]
*  It's pretty fucking awesome. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1649.0400000000002s)]
*  If I can have more, it's awesome. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1650.0400000000002s)]
*  You can never have too much, I don't think. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1651.22s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1653.64s)]
*  Because I'm going to take accountability. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1656.68s)]
*  I'm going to be responsible for my actions. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1658.44s)]
*  I'm not going to mess with other people. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1660.2600000000002s)]
*  I'm not going to impede on their ability to pursue happiness because I'm responsible. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1663.2s)]
*  But I think that's me, that's you. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1669.24s)]
*  I think there's a whole other side of the country. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1672.2800000000002s)]
*  They're like, hey, I don't want any responsibility for this. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1674.72s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1678.68s)]
*  I think what you're saying is so important because I think freedom without responsibility [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1679.68s)]
*  is what everyone's scared of. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1686.24s)]

*  about is freedom without responsibility, even illegal immigration, it's freedom without [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1694.84s)]
*  responsibility. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1699.04s)]

*  They have their shit together. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1716.24s)]
*  We should be doing, instead of trying to take away freedom, try giving people the tools [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1718.36s)]
*  that they need to be more accountable and to do better in their life and to get their [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1724.3799999999999s)]
*  fucking shit together. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1730.74s)]
*  That should be the number one emphasis, not taking away your rights because some people [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1732.6s)]
*  can't handle it. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1737.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1739.24s)]
*  That equals everything. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1741.1200000000001s)]
*  Then it's like, we'll say that the highly motivated people that will live their life [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1742.6s)]
*  with virtue and courage and pursue all of what I would say is Western philosophic principles, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1748.32s)]
*  I think we collectively can be trusted with that responsibility. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1757.36s)]
*  But then you have that other piece that's saying, I don't want to have anything to do [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1762.4s)]
*  with that. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=1766.52s)]

*  I always saw him with a lunchbox. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2552.6s)]
*  He worked in the woods my entire life. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2554.9199999999996s)]
*  But I wasn't good at shit, which is also good. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2558.2s)]
*  I like to fuck around with my buddies and I like to do interesting things, I guess, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2564.2s)]
*  for that, like try to jump motorcycles or whatever kind of random shit you'd come up [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2569.52s)]
*  with. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2574.0s)]
*  As I got into the military, I was like, oh, I'm good at this. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2577.0s)]
*  I'm really good at this for some reason. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2580.6s)]
*  I can run fast. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2583.0s)]
*  I can shoot well. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2584.0s)]
*  I can put together semi-coherent sentences. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2586.9199999999996s)]
*  So shit, I can be good at this. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2590.3999999999996s)]
*  This is something I can, you know, steal the phrase, accelerate your life or whatever. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2592.44s)]
*  I can accelerate my life. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2597.12s)]
*  And it was fun, dude. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2598.44s)]
*  I could jump out of planes and learn different languages and spend most of my life out of [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2599.44s)]
*  the country. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2606.04s)]
*  But it was the same kind of evolution. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2608.48s)]
*  It's like I found this thing that I was really good at. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2610.52s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2615.48s)]
*  And I could just go chips in on it. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2617.08s)]
*  It built layers of confidence and allowed me to just build the confidence to say, well, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2619.7200000000003s)]
*  you know what, if I was good at this, I could probably apply this to other things in life. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2625.68s)]
*  And it just compounds. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2631.04s)]
*  Like the way I built Black Rifle and why I did was like my mission statement when I transitioned [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2632.04s)]
*  out was to transition out of government service and live a happy and fulfilling life. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2638.32s)]
*  That was it. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2644.84s)]
*  It didn't have anything to do with money or goals or any of those things. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2647.12s)]
*  It was how do I define happiness? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2651.12s)]
*  How do I define fulfillment? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2652.6s)]
*  And then as we grew the company after about the first year, it became really evident that [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2654.6s)]
*  I could not only do something because I had this beautiful family that I loved, like my [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2660.7599999999998s)]
*  kids and my wife, and they're giving me so much power and endurance. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2665.56s)]
*  What if I built this really cool company where you could leave the family that you love and [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2670.7999999999997s)]
*  go to work in a company that you love and then it would become a flywheel who just get [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2675.36s)]
*  faster and faster and faster in your life and create more happiness, more fulfillment? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2679.1200000000003s)]
*  What if I could scale that and give that to other people? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2684.36s)]
*  And so far, I mean, it's fucking worked. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2688.76s)]
*  I feel so happy and I feel so like I'm so grateful. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2692.96s)]
*  I'm just so grateful for the things that I've been able to do over the last 10 years. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2701.4399999999996s)]
*  And I tell this to people all the time, or go to my refrigerator, pull milk out for my [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2707.12s)]
*  kids. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2712.12s)]
*  There's not a morning or a day that doesn't go by where I don't thank my customers for [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2713.12s)]
*  they've given me this opportunity. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2719.2s)]
*  They've given me this opportunity to make crazy art and amazing coffee and build this [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2721.3599999999997s)]

*  It's them. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2731.32s)]
*  They did it. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2732.32s)]
*  They did it for me. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2733.32s)]
*  I just kind of like have facilitated it. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2734.32s)]
*  But it was the perfect thing for you to plug into and to apply your passion into a new [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2736.96s)]
*  direction. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2741.5600000000004s)]

*  Yeah, man. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2745.6000000000004s)]
*  You haven't brought me a mug. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2746.6000000000004s)]

*  It's white on the inside so I could see how dark the coffee is. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2749.0400000000004s)]
*  That's a real coffee nerd, folks. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2752.0800000000004s)]
*  It's built perfectly from, and I won't like, everybody will gloss over and start like tuning [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2754.76s)]
*  out, but it's 1 to 16 ratio brew method from 30 grams of coffee in and 480 grams yielded. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2761.32s)]

*  How dark is it? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2770.1800000000003s)]
*  How light is it? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2771.1800000000003s)]
*  You can kind of, I built it for the perfect mug based on how many fingers can you get [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2772.1800000000003s)]

*  What's the weight of it? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2779.5200000000004s)]
*  I also build things that if you have to hit somebody in the fucking face with it, it's [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2780.56s)]
*  got some heft. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2788.28s)]

*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2791.28s)]
*  This has got a lot more heft to it. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2792.28s)]
*  It's got a heavy bottom in it, so there's a little bit of thought that went into that. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2794.08s)]
*  You can fuck someone up with that, especially if you get your hand around it this way. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2797.7599999999998s)]
*  That's how I would do it. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2800.7599999999998s)]

*  It's just perfect for my fat fingers. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2822.56s)]
*  It gets right in there. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2824.4s)]

*  It's a lot of, there's a lot of stocking and blown stocks and missed shots and missed opportunities [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2911.4s)]
*  and you get winded and elk hunting is amazing, dude. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2916.36s)]
*  That's, it's amazing. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2920.7999999999997s)]
*  That bull that you killed, um, paraffors, like that thing was so cool to watch. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2922.52s)]
*  Cause I watched the entire thing and I'll, I'll recite it from my position because I [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2931.44s)]
*  couldn't really see you very well because you'd moved off and I'm looking at him from [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2936.08s)]
*  across. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2941.08s)]
*  Um, I was on one spur, you were on the other and there's a little valley in between us, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2942.32s)]
*  but we were probably, I don't know, a thousand yards away and I'm watching you through my [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2947.0s)]
*  binos trying to figure out what you're doing. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2951.48s)]
*  Cause I could see the bowl and then he got up and I couldn't tell if you were winded [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2953.92s)]
*  or not. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2960.16s)]
*  But then all I heard, like I saw him tear ass up the hill and then tumble down. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2961.16s)]
*  He was dead in five seconds, three and a half, five seconds at the most. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2967.92s)]
*  And I heard it from across the canyon. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2972.86s)]
*  You yelled so loud. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2976.44s)]
*  And we started laughing. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2979.92s)]
*  Did you like, yeah. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2980.92s)]
*  And it echoed all the way down through the canyon. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2981.92s)]
*  I was like, well, bull down. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2985.08s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2986.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2987.48s)]
*  I gave a brick flare. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2988.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2989.48s)]
*  I gave a giant woo. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2990.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2991.48s)]
*  They're the fucking most interesting animal to me. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2992.48s)]
*  I mean, I've deer hunted, I've bear hunted, I've hunted axis deer. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2994.12s)]
*  I've hunted a lot of different animals, but elk to me are like the most majestic. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=2998.32s)]
*  They're the coolest looking. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3003.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3005.12s)]
*  They're, they're fucking smart as shit. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3006.12s)]
*  When they smell you, their senses are so good. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3008.0s)]
*  They're always tuned in to what the fuck is going on. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3011.68s)]
*  And the only time you catch them slipping is when they're hungry, they're tired or they [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3014.68s)]
*  want to fuck. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3019.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3020.08s)]
*  And we caught him when he was tired. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3021.08s)]
*  Smug. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3022.08s)]
*  He decided to take a nap. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3023.08s)]
*  And I was like, okay, buddy, you just fucked up. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3024.08s)]
*  And I creeped in with my socks on. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3026.4s)]
*  I creeped in for a half an hour. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3029.24s)]
*  I was moving so slow because his head was kind of turned sideways. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3031.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3035.72s)]
*  And I could never tell if he was looking at me. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3036.7599999999998s)]
*  So I had to make no movement. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3038.24s)]
*  I was just inching towards that motherfucker. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3039.9599999999996s)]
*  And every time you turn away, I get a couple of slow steps and I'd have to stop. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3042.68s)]
*  And then I'd have to wonder, I wonder if he remembers what he saw when he turned before [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3047.8399999999997s)]
*  and if that fucking tree is closer. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3052.72s)]
*  I wonder if he's going to perk up. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3054.52s)]
*  It's so exciting. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3058.12s)]
*  Your fucking heart's pounding. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3059.12s)]
*  And I'm breathing. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3060.12s)]
*  I'm doing all these breathing exercises to slow my heart rate down. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3061.12s)]
*  So much fun, man. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3066.8s)]
*  So much fun. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3067.8s)]
*  And then I'm always, whenever it gets dark around that spot, I'm always wondering about [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3068.8s)]
*  cats. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3072.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3073.6400000000003s)]
*  Because there's so many cats there. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3074.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm always wondering, what if there's an old one who can't really catch deer anymore? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3075.6400000000003s)]
*  He's like, that thing looks good. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3079.92s)]
*  That thing looks slow as fuck. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3082.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3083.76s)]
*  It's that origin camouflage makes you look maybe like caramel or something. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3084.76s)]
*  Yeah, he smells like coffee and sugar. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3088.08s)]
*  He's like jacked up on RTDs and like... [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3091.2s)]
*  Yeah, like I worry about cats. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3095.2799999999997s)]
*  You do? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3098.44s)]
*  Yeah, but once I saw one in Utah, I was with my friend Colton and we were maybe 30 yards [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3099.44s)]
*  away. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3106.16s)]
*  He stops the truck and he goes, look at that cat. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3107.16s)]
*  He goes, look at that fucking lion under the tree. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3108.16s)]
*  I look and I see his eyes glowing. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3111.04s)]
*  And I'm like, oh my God, he's huge. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3112.72s)]
*  And then I get the binos out. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3116.36s)]
*  So I'm inside the truck and I'm looking in his fucking face like right... [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3117.98s)]
*  It was terrifying. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3122.22s)]
*  He was so big. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3124.26s)]
*  He had these massive forearms, dude. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3125.26s)]
*  Just jacked forearms. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3128.14s)]
*  And this big old pumpkin head. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3130.14s)]
*  I mean, it was a big male cat. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3131.5s)]
*  And I was like, I'd never seen one that big. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3134.44s)]
*  I'd seen little ones before. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3136.98s)]
*  I saw like one that looked like it was about like 60 pounds and the other one was pretty [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3138.18s)]
*  much the same size. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3142.54s)]
*  Those are the only two cats I've ever seen before. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3143.54s)]
*  And I saw them like very briefly. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3145.66s)]
*  This motherfucker was just sitting there under a tree at dusk with the big fucking head, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3147.22s)]
*  man. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3153.4199999999996s)]
*  And it just, the feeling of helplessness was overwhelming. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3154.4199999999996s)]
*  That like, if that thing decided to jump me, it's over. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3157.14s)]
*  You're done. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3161.02s)]
*  There's not a thing you're going to be able to do. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3162.02s)]
*  It's so much stronger. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3163.6s)]
*  It's a gigantic house cat. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3164.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3166.8199999999997s)]
*  Do you guys have cats? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3167.8199999999997s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3168.98s)]
*  No, but I've had, I've had cats many years and cats kill so much shit. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3169.98s)]
*  They kill so much shit. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3174.66s)]
*  It's always a debate. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3176.7s)]
*  My wife and I have gone back and forth on like, do we get a cat? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3179.22s)]
*  Do we not get a cat? [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3181.8999999999996s)]
*  And there's some, they carry some parasite, I guess. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3182.8999999999996s)]
*  Toxoplasmosis. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3185.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3186.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3187.58s)]
*  Mostly the wild cats get it. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3188.58s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3189.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3190.58s)]
*  It's from like wild. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3191.58s)]
*  It's from rats. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3192.58s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3193.58s)]
*  It is a wild parasite. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3194.58s)]
*  And there's a guy named Robert Sapolsky out of, is he out of Stanford? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3197.8599999999997s)]
*  I think he's out of Stanford. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3204.2999999999997s)]
*  He's a brilliant guy. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3207.54s)]
*  He's done a lot of work on toxoplasmosis. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3209.14s)]
*  And toxoplasmosis is the reason why they tell people not to touch women's, women that are [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3211.06s)]
*  pregnant not to touch their cat's litter box. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3216.06s)]
*  Because it can really fuck the kid up. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3219.06s)]
*  And it can really fuck you up too. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3221.62s)]
*  But what it does with people is wild. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3223.3399999999997s)]
*  What it does with people is it makes them more reckless. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3225.38s)]
*  And a disproportionate number of motorcycle victims have tested positive for toxoplasmosis. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3227.9s)]
*  Some countries at one point in time, France was as high as 50% of the population was infected [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3233.88s)]
*  by it. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3239.1600000000003s)]
*  What? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3240.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3241.1600000000003s)]
*  It is a wild parasite that changes the way you think. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3242.1600000000003s)]
*  And one of the things it does is it's parasites are so fascinating because they literally [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3244.4s)]
*  can hijack another body and get it to do different things. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3250.38s)]
*  So they get inside a rat, the rat gets infected with toxoplasmosis and it rewires the rat's [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3254.38s)]
*  sexual reward system. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3259.84s)]
*  The rat now becomes sexually aroused by the smell of cat urine. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3261.88s)]
*  It also completely removes any fear that the rat would have of cats. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3266.28s)]
*  So the rat goes towards the cat, the cat kills the rat and eats the rat. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3271.4s)]
*  The only way the parasite can reproduce is inside the cat's gut. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3275.6400000000003s)]
*  So the cat, which is seemingly unaffected by this parasite, is just making it inside [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3280.54s)]
*  of its body. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3286.34s)]
*  And then when it gets out, it affects all the creatures around it. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3287.42s)]
*  It probably does affect cats too, but cats are so crazy anyway, how would you know? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3290.88s)]
*  It makes them slightly crazier. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3294.32s)]
*  But with people, it makes them wilder. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3296.08s)]
*  It makes them more reckless. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3298.0s)]
*  Is that why you don't have cats? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3300.2000000000003s)]
*  No, I probably have it. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3301.48s)]
*  I probably have toxo. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3302.84s)]
*  I've had feral cats. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3303.84s)]
*  I had a feral cat for a while. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3305.6400000000003s)]
*  He was nuts. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3307.5s)]
*  He was so nuts that when I had to fix him, he was like, I guess he's like, when I got [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3309.06s)]
*  him, a friend of mine had these cats under her apartment. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3314.32s)]
*  Her and her boyfriend captured these cats, these little kittens. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3319.28s)]
*  And she goes, you want a kitten? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3323.1600000000003s)]
*  And I had a cat already. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3325.48s)]
*  I'm like, oh, get my cat a friend. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3326.48s)]
*  And so I get this fucking cat. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3328.2000000000003s)]
*  And the moment I see it, it hiss, it's a tiny little thing, a little tiny thing. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3331.1600000000003s)]
*  It's hissing at you like it's a demon. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3336.2000000000003s)]
*  And I pick it up and it instantly starts purring, purring loud, like a foster kid who's finally [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3337.96s)]
*  been hugged. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3343.6600000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3344.6600000000003s)]
*  Just purring. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3345.6600000000003s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this poor little dude. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3347.66s)]
*  So to get him accustomed to me, I had to stay in one of the bedrooms in this house that [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3350.54s)]
*  I was renting just with him. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3356.42s)]
*  So I brought some books in there. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3358.18s)]
*  I brought his litter box and I brought cat food. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3359.8999999999996s)]
*  And I just hung out with this fucking cat for like days in this room. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3363.2799999999997s)]
*  And I had to do it that way because every time I would leave, when I'd come back in, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3367.3399999999997s)]
*  he would literally climb the walls just hissing and jumping and clawing at the drapes. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3370.96s)]
*  It was wild. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3377.1s)]
*  And then I would corner him and I'd touch him and he would start purring again. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3378.38s)]
*  And then I'd pick him up and I'd start petting him. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3382.2400000000002s)]
*  And then I'd just sit there like reading a book. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3384.2400000000002s)]
*  And I did it for days to get this cat comfortable with me. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3386.2s)]
*  And it worked. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3389.16s)]
*  I was the only one he was comfortable with though. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3390.7s)]
*  Anybody else came over the house, you could not pick him up. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3392.7200000000003s)]
*  If you tried to pick him up, he would fuck you up. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3395.0s)]
*  Like he'd bite you, he'd claw at you. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3397.08s)]
*  But with me, he was cool. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3399.38s)]
*  It was weird. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3401.46s)]
*  But he was only cool, like I had to like slowly approach him. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3402.46s)]
*  His name was Jack Dempsey because Jack Dempsey was a hobo. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3405.6600000000003s)]
*  So I thought it was a good name for him. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3408.6600000000003s)]
*  So I'd pet him and then he'd immediately start purring. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3410.92s)]
*  Then I could pick him up. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3413.98s)]
*  And he was like, you're the only one. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3414.98s)]
*  I'm like, it's okay. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3416.26s)]
*  As long as it's just me. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3417.26s)]
*  You and me, buddy, we're good. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3418.26s)]
*  So I had to get him fixed. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3419.6400000000003s)]
*  And he must have known that my intentions were different than before. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3421.34s)]
*  And so he wouldn't let me pick him up. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3427.36s)]
*  And I had to get him into a laundry hamper. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3429.42s)]
*  That was the only way I was going to be able to carry him. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3430.42s)]
*  So I cornered him in the bathroom and he's hissing. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3432.7000000000003s)]
*  He's jumping from the tub to the sink. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3435.46s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, calm the fuck down. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3437.62s)]
*  It's just me. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3439.6600000000003s)]
*  Calm down. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3440.6600000000003s)]
*  So then I get a blanket and I throw the blanket over him and I wrestle him and I stuff him [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3441.6600000000003s)]
*  into this fucking hamper. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3446.26s)]
*  And I bring him to this guy, Dr. Craig, who was an amazing guy. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3448.06s)]
*  The one of dying later in a car accident was one of the saddest fucking things. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3452.38s)]
*  He was the coolest vet ever. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3455.54s)]
*  He was the coolest. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3457.82s)]
*  And I brought him in and I go, hey man, I don't even know if you could do this. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3458.94s)]
*  But he's spraying in my house now. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3462.92s)]
*  He needs to get fixed. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3464.46s)]
*  But he's wild. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3465.46s)]
*  And he's like, how wild? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3466.46s)]
*  I go, look how I have him. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3468.42s)]
*  I got him in the hamper. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3470.2200000000003s)]
*  He's in the fucking hamper. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3471.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like bouncing around. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3472.2200000000003s)]
*  So they had to hold this cat down somehow or another and anesthetize him, put him out, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3473.2200000000003s)]
*  and then they had to fix him. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3480.7400000000002s)]
*  And then brought him back and he was cool. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3482.0800000000004s)]
*  He was fine. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3483.94s)]
*  Yeah, he was cool with me. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3484.94s)]
*  He was always cool with me. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3485.94s)]
*  We got over whatever that was that I fucking kidnapped him. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3487.06s)]
*  We got over it and he would let me pick him up again. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3490.5s)]
*  But only me. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3492.5s)]
*  Like, no, my friends, no one, even people that were over the house all the time, no [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3493.5s)]
*  one could pet him. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3497.1s)]
*  That's actually kind of cool. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3498.7000000000003s)]

*  That's one of the reasons why we haven't had him. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3504.42s)]
*  Because I'm like, yeah. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3506.34s)]

*  That's the place to have them. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3627.5s)]
*  They fucking keep everything away. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3629.06s)]
*  There's this hunting lease that my friend Tyler from archery country has and we went [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3631.1400000000003s)]
*  there and there's this cool fucking wild cat that hangs out there. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3635.02s)]
*  But he's like domesticated. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3638.46s)]
*  Like he comes up to you and rubs up against you and you're like, what's up little buddy? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3639.46s)]
*  And that cat just kills everything. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3643.02s)]
*  All he does is, I mean, he's, I don't think anybody feeds him. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3645.26s)]
*  I think he just wanders around that ranch killing everything he needs to eat. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3648.02s)]
*  That's a great life. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3653.02s)]
*  It's a great life for him. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3654.02s)]
*  He's so happy. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3655.02s)]
*  That cat, because he loves people. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3656.18s)]
*  Like he's not a wild cat in a sense that he's not domesticated because he does come right [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3658.34s)]
*  up to you and rubs up against you and you pat him and he rubs over. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3664.18s)]
*  You can rub his belly. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3667.42s)]
*  He's not worried about people at all. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3668.42s)]
*  Everybody treats him really nice. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3669.82s)]
*  So he's like a sweet, sweet cat. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3671.22s)]
*  But no one's feeding him. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3673.78s)]
*  He's just a little murderer. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3675.42s)]
*  Just running around eating rats and mice and fucking birds. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3676.9s)]
*  I've got a whole new respect for him. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3681.5s)]
*  Like reading that. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3683.14s)]
*  I had no context to the billions of animals that are the small rodents and shit that they're [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3684.2599999999998s)]
*  murdering every year. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3690.3399999999997s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3691.3399999999997s)]
*  It is amazing. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3692.3399999999997s)]
*  But it's also kind of crazy that they also seem content to just chill in an apartment. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3693.3399999999997s)]
*  Like cats don't seem to have a problem being in an apartment. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3697.66s)]
*  I went out to Ryan Holiday's bookstore yesterday and I just cruised around in there because [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3701.2999999999997s)]
*  it's like 20 minutes outside of town and he's got two cats cruising around in there. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3708.98s)]
*  Hanging out in the bookstore. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3714.18s)]
*  Yeah, hanging out in the bookstore. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3715.18s)]
*  And laying on boxes and running around. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3716.18s)]
*  It's like, ah, that's fucking cool, man. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3719.42s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3720.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3721.94s)]
*  Look, I love cats. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3722.94s)]
*  It's just like my kids are alerted to them. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3723.94s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3725.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3726.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3727.94s)]
*  And my wife's alerted to them too. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3728.94s)]
*  But I prefer dogs. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3730.46s)]
*  But my dog is an amazing dog, but he's dumb as shit too. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3732.18s)]
*  And so I just got him back from the hospital. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3736.62s)]
*  I'm going to send this to you, Jamie, so you can see these pictures. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3738.94s)]
*  I just got him back. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3742.26s)]
*  So we came home the other night and Marshall had eaten chicken food that was outside on [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3744.82s)]
*  gravel, but he didn't bother to differentiate between the gravel and the chicken food. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3752.78s)]
*  So he ate about two pounds of gravel. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3758.2200000000003s)]
*  And I'm not exaggerating. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3760.3s)]
*  Two pounds of gravel. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3762.1800000000003s)]
*  It was pounds of gravel. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3763.1800000000003s)]
*  There was so much gravel that he ate that he threw up. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3765.34s)]
*  That's a pile of gravel that he threw up. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3769.34s)]
*  That's one of seven piles of gravel. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3771.66s)]
*  Show the other picture that I sent you. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3774.2999999999997s)]
*  That's my foot for reference. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3775.98s)]
*  I just sent you another one. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3777.46s)]
*  That one. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3782.18s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3783.18s)]
*  So we found that's all gravel that he threw up. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3784.18s)]
*  So once he threw up like six times in the house and then the seventh time, it looks [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3788.02s)]
*  like he threw up several different times there. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3793.54s)]
*  So I took him to the emergency vet and they do an x-ray and he still has gravel in his [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3796.22s)]
*  stomach and gravel in his colon. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3801.58s)]
*  And they're not as concerned about the gravel in his colon, but they were concerned about [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3804.86s)]
*  the gravel in his stomach. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3807.94s)]
*  So I had to take him to a hospital where he stayed overnight for two days and they gave [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3809.18s)]
*  him liquid therapy. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3813.46s)]
*  They put an IV to him and they monitored him and they made sure that he was okay. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3814.46s)]
*  And he eventually shit out all the gravel and they didn't have to do surgery, but there [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3818.7s)]
*  was a concern that there could be an obstruction. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3821.98s)]
*  But they finally let him out today and he's fine. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3824.74s)]
*  But that's the kind of shit you have to deal with if you have pets. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3827.14s)]
*  He ate gravel. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3831.54s)]
*  He ate two pounds of gravel. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3832.54s)]
*  My golden's name is Potato. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3834.18s)]
*  And I rebranded him because his first name was Maximus. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3836.2999999999997s)]
*  And we were driving down the road one day. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3840.94s)]
*  It was like, this dog needs a naming rebrand because his fucking brain is like a potato. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3842.2599999999998s)]
*  And then that was it. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3848.64s)]
*  Does Maximus have his balls? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3849.98s)]
*  Does he have his balls? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3851.46s)]
*  No. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3852.46s)]
*  No, he was a, we adopted him. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3853.46s)]
*  He was like two years old when we got him. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3855.2599999999998s)]
*  I've got a golden doodle on a golden. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3857.74s)]
*  So they're just one's beans, one's potato. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3860.82s)]
*  The other one's Dr. Beans. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3863.34s)]
*  I've met Dr. Beans. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3864.78s)]
*  Yeah, Dr. Beans is the best. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3866.9s)]
*  He's like, he's a cool dog. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3868.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3869.94s)]
*  He's the chillest of the chill. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3870.94s)]
*  I'm not like a cat hater, but I absolutely prefer dogs. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3871.94s)]
*  There's a thing, I have a relationship with my dog. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3875.98s)]
*  He's like my friend. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3879.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3880.66s)]
*  Like I come home, I could talk to him. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3881.66s)]
*  He listens to me. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3883.22s)]
*  He kind of knows what I'm saying. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3884.22s)]
*  There's little things that we do, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3886.3s)]
*  like you want to get the ball? [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3887.78s)]
*  He just pops up and be like, let's fucking go. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3889.46s)]
*  These videos of me with him with the ball. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3891.7000000000003s)]
*  I've never been more excited in my life about anything. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3893.82s)]
*  Maybe other than elk hunting. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3895.7000000000003s)]
*  This dog is fucking bouncing around. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3897.42s)]
*  He's going, and every day I'm like, is he gonna be bored? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3899.06s)]
*  We could do this ball thing every day. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3901.7000000000003s)]
*  There's not a fucking day where he's bored. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3903.34s)]
*  He's like, the ball's out. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3905.46s)]
*  Holy shit, we're gonna do the ball. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3907.26s)]
*  It's like, he's so simple. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3909.94s)]
*  But if you had a guy come in and you're like, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3911.82s)]
*  you want to get the elk? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3913.9s)]
*  You want to get the elk, Joe? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3914.9s)]
*  You'd probably be the same way. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3916.82s)]
*  You'd be like, fuck yeah. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3917.6600000000003s)]
*  No, the thing is, with elk hunting, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3918.6600000000003s)]
*  the only way it's really exciting is if it's hard. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3921.7000000000003s)]
*  That's what was so exciting about that hunt [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3925.02s)]
*  that you watch from a distance. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3926.78s)]
*  It's like, I had to creep in on this fucking dude [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3927.82s)]
*  and hope the wind didn't shift. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3930.78s)]
*  I had to creep in on this dude [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3932.82s)]
*  and hope that he didn't catch me moving. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3933.98s)]
*  I had to hope that there was a window where I could draw, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3935.82s)]
*  where he wasn't gonna be, once he gets up, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3938.54s)]
*  what if he's getting up facing me and I can't draw? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3940.38s)]
*  And I'm trying to figure out when do I draw? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3943.34s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3945.22s)]
*  I don't know, I know I ranged him at 50, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3947.02s)]
*  but I took two steps. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3948.8599999999997s)]
*  What is this right here? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3950.7s)]
*  Is he at 48? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3951.8999999999996s)]
*  Is he at 47? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3953.74s)]
*  Where do I aim? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3955.02s)]
*  There's so much going on that when it's successful, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3956.3399999999997s)]
*  that's what's so exciting that it's hard to do. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3960.22s)]
*  The ball's fucking, he knows that ball's coming every day. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3962.8999999999996s)]
*  But he's so excited. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3965.2999999999997s)]
*  It's like instant gratification. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3966.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like the ball's coming! [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3968.5s)]
*  Woo hoo! [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3970.22s)]
*  Did you shoot that bow yesterday? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3971.14s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3972.74s)]
*  So what's the difference? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3973.58s)]
*  It's smoother, it's better. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3974.7s)]
*  Yeah, they made a few significant changes. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3976.18s)]
*  There's a new Hoyt bow that just came out. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3979.2999999999997s)]
*  What are they calling it? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3981.62s)]
*  See if you can find it. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3982.46s)]
*  The Keep Hammer in addition. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3983.2999999999997s)]
*  I think it's the VXM 33. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3984.94s)]
*  Did you go up? [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3986.62s)]
*  Are you still at 80 or did you go up? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3987.66s)]
*  I have two bows. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3989.42s)]
*  I have an 80 and a 90. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3990.2999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3991.46s)]
*  Yeah, so one's at an 81 or 82, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3992.2999999999997s)]
*  and the other one's at 90. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3994.66s)]
*  Can you feel the difference? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3996.42s)]
*  Yeah, you feel when you pull in the back. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3997.3799999999997s)]
*  What about in accuracy? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=3998.98s)]
*  Well, they're both super, super accurate. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4001.14s)]
*  The thing is you just can't shoot as many arrows [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4005.1s)]
*  in a day with a 90 pound bow. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4008.2999999999997s)]
*  I've figured that out a long time, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4010.7s)]
*  which is why I got an 80. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4012.22s)]
*  I have a 60 at the studio, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4013.8199999999997s)]
*  which is like a kid's bow. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4015.14s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4016.46s)]
*  You draw it back, it's just like so easy. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4017.46s)]
*  And I just use that one for practicing my form [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4019.66s)]
*  and because it's just nice to have a bow at the studio. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4023.54s)]
*  And then there's the 80 that I shot Elon Musk's [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4025.7799999999997s)]
*  cyber truck with that just happened to be laying around. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4029.14s)]
*  That thing just bounced right off of it. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4032.3s)]
*  That was actually one of the fucking coolest videos. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4034.3s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4037.46s)]
*  He let me shoot his truck with a bow. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4038.3s)]
*  He's like, oh yeah, you wanna go shoot it? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4039.7400000000002s)]
*  Let's shoot it. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4041.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4041.98s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4042.82s)]
*  So it's got a little scratch on it now forever. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4043.66s)]
*  The tiniest scratch too. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4045.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4047.3s)]
*  And it's a fucking heavy ass arrow from an 80 pound bow [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4048.14s)]
*  and it didn't do shit to that door. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4051.22s)]
*  It just blew it up. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4053.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4054.14s)]
*  But the new Hoyts, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4054.98s)]
*  they, one of the things about bows for people who don't know, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4055.86s)]
*  unlike firearms, which are essentially like, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4060.1000000000004s)]
*  if you have a like a Sig P365, that's what that gun is. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4062.78s)]
*  Like if you got that gun five years ago, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4069.44s)]
*  like they made a comp version of the 365. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4071.2200000000003s)]
*  So they put compensation in the barrel. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4073.6600000000003s)]
*  Just makes it a little better, a little easier to shoot. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4075.78s)]
*  That's the, but they make essentially the same kind of gun [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4077.86s)]
*  with small improvements for years and years. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4082.96s)]
*  Like if you buy a five year old gun, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4085.54s)]
*  it's still a top of the line gun. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4087.18s)]
*  Right. Right. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4088.66s)]
*  Bows somehow or another, they through engineering [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4089.58s)]
*  and these fucking wizards, they make them better [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4093.74s)]
*  incrementally every year. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4097.78s)]
*  They really do. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4099.5s)]
*  Like I noticed the difference between last year's bow [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4100.56s)]
*  and the year before. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4103.5s)]
*  Like the moment I shot, I was like, wow, this is smoother. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4104.34s)]
*  And one day just for the fuck of it, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4107.0199999999995s)]
*  I picked up the previous year's bow [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4110.26s)]
*  and I was noticing a difference. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4112.9s)]
*  I was like, oh, this doesn't feel as good. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4115.179999999999s)]
*  The draw cycle's not as good. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4116.66s)]
*  The release doesn't feel as smooth, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4118.38s)]
*  but it was better than the year before. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4119.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4121.7s)]
*  And so last year's bow was like, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4122.54s)]
*  this is how they're gonna top this. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4123.54s)]
*  This bow is amazing. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4124.98s)]
*  It's so accurate, it's so smooth. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4126.0199999999995s)]
*  Boom, they did it. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4127.9s)]
*  They topped it. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4128.78s)]
*  They keep making them better. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4129.94s)]
*  They're more efficient. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4131.0599999999995s)]
*  They pull back smoother. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4132.46s)]
*  They're more dead in the hand. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4134.38s)]
*  This bow feels like nothing when it goes off. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4136.219999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4138.5s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4139.339999999999s)]
*  It goes off. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4140.16s)]
*  There's like zero vibration. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4141.0s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4142.179999999999s)]
*  Whatever they're doing in terms of, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4143.2s)]
*  there's a particular design of their riser [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4145.2s)]
*  that the vibration, even if it goes through the bow [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4149.12s)]
*  on the shot, almost none of it is going through your hand. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4153.2s)]
*  It's incredibly dead in the hand, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4156.08s)]
*  which leads you to be more accurate. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4158.12s)]
*  Everything is about accuracy and efficiency [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4160.5599999999995s)]
*  and smoothness and comfort. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4163.0s)]
*  Have you transitioned over to that stand clicker yet? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4165.2s)]
*  Have you tried that thing? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4168.639999999999s)]
*  I do like that, but I keep going back to the Nock to it [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4169.48s)]
*  because the thing about the stand clicker is, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4172.36s)]
*  this is nerd talk folks. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4174.5199999999995s)]
*  It makes your draw length one quarter inch longer [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4178.24s)]
*  because it's one quarter inch longer [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4181.74s)]
*  than the head of the Nock to it, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4183.679999999999s)]
*  which I'm so accustomed to. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4185.799999999999s)]
*  So all my anchor points are slightly different. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4187.36s)]
*  So with the stand, the string is just a quarter inch [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4189.92s)]
*  further forward and there's something about that [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4193.32s)]
*  that maybe I have to get used to. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4196.759999999999s)]
*  Maybe if I pull harder on the wall, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4198.759999999999s)]
*  I maintain the same stability, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4200.52s)]
*  or maybe if I extend my arm out a little bit more, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4202.280000000001s)]
*  I maintain the same stability. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4205.120000000001s)]
*  I'd have to transition and try it [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4206.72s)]
*  because I had been using Dudley's archery releases [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4208.52s)]
*  for so long, between the two smooth, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4212.200000000001s)]
*  the hinge, which I really like, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4215.160000000001s)]
*  and then his other one, the Nock to it, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4216.64s)]
*  which is the thumb button that I really like. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4218.88s)]
*  I'm just so used to those. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4221.400000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna say, I keep going back. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4222.6s)]
*  I've tried the stand clicker, the stand non-clicker, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4225.200000000001s)]
*  I think it's the T. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4228.4800000000005s)]
*  The hinge, I've had a bunch of these, [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4230.76s)]
*  and I keep coming back. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4232.28s)]
*  I'm the most accurate, hands down, with the Nock to it. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4233.320000000001s)]
*  I think it's just because I've got so many reps, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4235.92s)]
*  it feels so natural. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4238.72s)]
*  Now that I've got that thing dialed to super hot. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4240.6s)]
*  Hot sauce. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4244.16s)]
*  Yeah, hot sauce. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4245.0s)]
*  You breathe on it wrong and it goes off. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4247.360000000001s)]
*  You gotta be careful with those. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4249.64s)]
*  You gotta always check them because I've had it [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4250.92s)]
*  when those are really hot with Carter releases, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4252.96s)]
*  well, they'll go off just based on the amount of tension [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4255.4800000000005s)]
*  that's on the string because I'm pulling so much weight. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4258.08s)]
*  So I always, wherever I like it, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4261.24s)]
*  I crank it a little bit stiffer now. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4263.12s)]
*  Just a little stiffer. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4265.04s)]
*  Just a little bit. Just a little. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4266.16s)]
*  I want it so I can put my thumb on it [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4268.5199999999995s)]
*  and know that the slightest amount of back pressure [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4271.44s)]
*  that motherfucker's going off. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4275.92s)]
*  Just the slightest amount. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4277.4s)]
*  So when I get that, then I go to my shot process, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4278.88s)]
*  I don't have any concerns about it going off. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4282.76s)]
*  It's just everything's there. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4285.6s)]
*  Let's fucking go and it's off. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4287.48s)]
*  And I feel like that to me is the most accurate. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4290.16s)]
*  And there's a lot of different schools. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4293.44s)]
*  A lot of people like it very heavy. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4295.599999999999s)]
*  And what they do is they hook the button in here [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4297.5199999999995s)]
*  in the crook of their thumb [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4300.919999999999s)]
*  and then they pinch their finger around it [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4302.04s)]
*  and they can get a good grip [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4303.96s)]
*  and then they're just all pulling with their back muscles [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4305.799999999999s)]
*  and that makes it go off. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4308.48s)]
*  And you can do that too. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4310.639999999999s)]
*  But I think that's because they want [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4312.36s)]
*  an absolute surprise shot [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4314.0s)]
*  because they're concerned they're gonna punch the trigger [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4316.76s)]
*  in that moment. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4318.72s)]
*  But I think the real thing is about controlling that moment. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4320.0s)]
*  The real thing is about staying cool in that moment. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4323.08s)]
*  And that's the hardest part of it. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4325.360000000001s)]
*  And I think the less anxiety you have [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4327.320000000001s)]
*  about your release, the better. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4329.56s)]
*  I know that motherfucker's going off if I wanted to. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4330.96s)]
*  But I also know how to do the shot process correctly. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4333.92s)]
*  So that's my little, what I've learned is I like it hot. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4336.88s)]
*  I like that bitch hot. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4341.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4343.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4343.84s)]
*  That's where I'm at. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4344.68s)]
*  Cause I had mindset way too tight [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4346.28s)]
*  and I would be essentially be pulling [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4348.88s)]
*  and pressing on the release slow, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4353.16s)]
*  looking at it kind of like a firearm trigger [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4357.12s)]
*  saying slow pressure, build the pressure, [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4359.16s)]
*  straight back, like no deviation. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4362.04s)]
*  And I'd go through this entire shot process from the rifle [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4364.36s)]
*  that I was incorporating into the bow. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4368.24s)]
*  But I'm too, I'm taking too much time on the backend, [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4370.64s)]
*  really building into my thumb release [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4374.88s)]
*  versus when you're ready and everything's dialed, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4377.64s)]
*  you know, you've, you've, you've get your ring overlap, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4381.320000000001s)]
*  your level's good, everything's set. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4383.88s)]
*  It's time to go. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4386.280000000001s)]
*  It's time to go. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4387.12s)]
*  It's time to go. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4387.96s)]
*  You can't be building to the shot. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4388.8s)]
*  Hot sauce. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4390.56s)]
*  Hot sauce is like, that is the way to go. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4391.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4393.6s)]
*  The way to go is hot sauce with a good shot process. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4394.4400000000005s)]
*  But you have to have a controlled shot process. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4397.56s)]
*  Like in my mind, I have like a whole process, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4399.36s)]
*  that Joel Turner process that I put myself through. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4402.08s)]
*  So it's all, it's really just all about [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4405.08s)]
*  not hammering the trigger over anxiety. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4407.48s)]
*  It's really all just about staying calm [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4410.5599999999995s)]
*  and letting it happen and knowing exactly what you're doing. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4413.12s)]
*  You concentrate on breathing through your nose [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4415.96s)]
*  and trying to get more oxygen [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4418.96s)]
*  as you're going through your thought process [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4421.2s)]
*  or do you just open your mouth? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4422.679999999999s)]
*  I concentrate on breathing through my nose [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4424.44s)]
*  when I'm calming myself down as I'm moving towards the shot. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4426.32s)]
*  In that particular moment, my heart was pounding [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4429.5199999999995s)]
*  as I was closing the gap, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4432.36s)]
*  because I was like, I think I'm gonna get this motherfucker. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4433.8s)]
*  And it's exciting. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4436.24s)]
*  Stocking on a bedded elk is very exciting. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4438.2s)]
*  I had to get within 50 yards [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4443.96s)]
*  because there was a log in front of him. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4445.36s)]
*  There was just like this downed tree. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4446.8s)]
*  And the only gap was I had to go up, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4448.96s)]
*  up above him in 50 yards. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4451.72s)]
*  And when I'm doing this, as I'm creeping in there, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4454.6s)]
*  there's so much anticipation [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4457.44s)]
*  that your heart's just fucking pounding. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4458.879999999999s)]
*  And that's what I'm doing, the breathing exercises. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4462.2s)]
*  But once I get there, I'm telling myself that I'm calm. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4464.4s)]
*  Once I'm there, I'm not allowing myself [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4468.0s)]
*  to get ramped up again once I'm in position. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4470.799999999999s)]
*  So once I'm in position, it's just task oriented. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4473.12s)]
*  It's just that I'm just completely locked in [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4475.96s)]
*  on his vitals and my shot process. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4479.32s)]
*  That's all I'm thinking about. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4481.719999999999s)]
*  And what I like about hot sauce [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4484.28s)]
*  is when I get to that spot and I'm at full draw, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4486.4s)]
*  there's no other things to think about. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4488.759999999999s)]
*  I got that pin on his vitals, my bubbles leveled, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4490.2s)]
*  everything feels good, pow pow, whack. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4493.36s)]
*  And then you can have fun. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4497.5599999999995s)]
*  Then you can go back to just being a normal human. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4500.599999999999s)]
*  But in that moment, for me, I have to be task oriented. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4503.759999999999s)]
*  If I'm thinking about it, I'm not thinking, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4508.879999999999s)]
*  I hope I don't miss, none of that shit. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4511.04s)]
*  I'm not letting any of that in. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4513.36s)]
*  All I'm thinking is task. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4514.96s)]
*  I have a task, very clear task. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4516.8s)]
*  And this is a, there's gonna be weird decisions [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4520.04s)]
*  that I'm gonna have to make [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4522.76s)]
*  because who knows what he's gonna do when he gets up. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4523.68s)]
*  Is he gonna go left? [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4526.08s)]
*  Is he gonna go right? [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4526.92s)]
*  What if that asshole steps behind the tree [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4528.12s)]
*  and now I'm fucked again? [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4530.08s)]
*  I have no shot. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4531.24s)]
*  If he just stepped and went left, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4532.08s)]
*  which they do all the time, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4534.2s)]
*  now I'm behind that log again and I'm fucked. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4535.84s)]
*  Do you have any anxiety or that same type of build [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4538.64s)]
*  where your heart starts to increase [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4544.320000000001s)]
*  as you're stepping on stage, any stage? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4547.0s)]
*  No. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4549.4400000000005s)]
*  No, you have none of that left. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4550.280000000001s)]
*  No, I had that in the beginning. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4551.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, in the beginning there was a full panic. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4553.240000000001s)]
*  But now you have zero now. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4555.360000000001s)]
*  No, now it's just exciting. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4557.360000000001s)]
*  Now it's like, now I have a whole thing I do [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4558.68s)]
*  where I get myself ramped up. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4561.64s)]
*  I jump around, I stretch before I go, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4563.12s)]
*  I'm not gonna hurt. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4566.0s)]
*  I hit my seat. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4567.52s)]
*  Occasionally I have a little cocktail. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4568.52s)]
*  But the whole idea is just get loose, get loose. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4570.4400000000005s)]
*  The best thing about comedy is you're doing it [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4573.68s)]
*  with a bunch of other people that are doing comedy. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4575.2s)]
*  It's almost like you're all going on stocks together. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4576.92s)]
*  So we're all hanging out in the green room talking shit [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4578.96s)]
*  and we're all going on the same show. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4581.08s)]
*  So we're having fun and it's like everybody's lively. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4582.96s)]
*  So the thing is you just don't wanna go on stage cold. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4586.24s)]
*  You would never wanna go on stage, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4589.08s)]
*  you would never wanna wake up like alarm clock, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4590.16s)]
*  bam, bam, bam, get up ladies and gentlemen, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4593.12s)]
*  Evan Hafer. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4596.4800000000005s)]
*  He'd be like, it would be terrible. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4598.8s)]
*  It would take a while for you to warm up. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4601.92s)]
*  It'd take a while for you to get into the groove. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4604.28s)]
*  So you gotta be at entertainment groove [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4607.639999999999s)]
*  as you step on stage. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4611.92s)]
*  So there's anticipation, but there's nothing like [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4613.08s)]
*  the anxiety of El Conte. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4616.36s)]
*  Nothing's even close. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4618.24s)]
*  It has a strange effect because I don't get [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4620.36s)]
*  hardly any anxiety ever for anything really, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4625.88s)]
*  unless I'm in a car wreck or something [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4629.4s)]
*  where I'm not trying to do that. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4631.88s)]
*  But El Conte for some reason, you get in front [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4632.96s)]
*  of this animal and you get ramped up. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4636.92s)]
*  I'm always talking to myself like, what the fuck? [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4641.24s)]
*  It's not like the swords on this thing's head [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4645.5199999999995s)]
*  are gonna come after you. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4648.0s)]
*  Why are you doing this? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4649.64s)]
*  Why is your body doing what it's doing right now? [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4651.68s)]
*  So I have to have this whole process of calm myself down, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4654.12s)]
*  breathe through my nose. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4658.0s)]
*  And then once I get into the shot, it's fine. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4659.76s)]
*  But building into that shot for some reason, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4663.56s)]
*  you start going, I need to wear a heart monitor [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4665.72s)]
*  and just watch to see how high that thing gets [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4669.24s)]
*  as you're moving in on a stock on the animal. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4672.04s)]
*  Because as you're building into that moment, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4674.64s)]
*  there's that time before you can settle into that position [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4678.360000000001s)]
*  where you're questioning like, why am I so ramped up [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4682.4400000000005s)]
*  right now? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4687.48s)]
*  I don't exactly know why. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4688.28s)]
*  So then you have to dial everything back, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4689.5199999999995s)]
*  pull everything back into perspective, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4691.639999999999s)]
*  focus on what you're doing. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4693.4s)]
*  And then once you have a task and the task is there, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4694.5599999999995s)]
*  then it seems to just settle down [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4697.719999999999s)]
*  and get right back into the moment. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4699.4s)]
*  Yeah, once you have the task, once it's in front of you, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4701.5199999999995s)]
*  it's moving into position. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4704.04s)]
*  But sometimes I can stop it. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4705.96s)]
*  When I was in Utah, we were on this one ridge [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4708.32s)]
*  and on this other ridge was this big bullfight. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4713.32s)]
*  This big bull that was running these cows. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4716.679999999999s)]
*  He was the king of the mountain. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4719.24s)]
*  You could see by his body, this is an old bull. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4720.32s)]
*  And he's running these cows, but he's way over. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4723.32s)]
*  He's like, you gotta go down and all the way up. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4726.28s)]
*  He's way too far for us to end the way. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4730.5599999999995s)]
*  We're out in the open. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4733.04s)]
*  There's no way you're gonna plant a stock on this bull [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4734.0s)]
*  in the position that he's at, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4736.08s)]
*  especially with the way the thermals are all going up. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4737.08s)]
*  So we start moving down this canyon. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4740.679999999999s)]
*  And as we're moving down this canyon, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4745.96s)]
*  the bull just randomly decides to run his cows down [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4747.56s)]
*  into the bottom and realizing, oh shit, this can happen. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4751.4400000000005s)]
*  And so as that's happening, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4755.04s)]
*  I stopped myself from getting ramped up, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4757.84s)]
*  completely stopped it. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4760.8s)]
*  I just recognized it was possibly coming [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4762.56s)]
*  because I see him making his way down this ridge [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4765.0s)]
*  and he's going right to where we're going. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4769.08s)]
*  And we know that there's a pond down there. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4770.8s)]
*  So if the pond is where he's going, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4772.96s)]
*  he's gonna go to get a drink [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4774.52s)]
*  and he's gonna come right down through this bottom. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4776.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's where he's gonna be at. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4777.84s)]
*  And I stayed calm the entire time. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4779.120000000001s)]
*  I never let myself ramp up. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4781.4400000000005s)]
*  I never got ramped up. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4783.0s)]
*  I mean, I was probably above normal heart rate, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4784.4800000000005s)]
*  but I was pretty fucking calm. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4787.04s)]
*  And then he came right out to 62 yards. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4789.280000000001s)]
*  It was perfect. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4791.84s)]
*  He was right out there. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4792.92s)]
*  It was perfect. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4794.56s)]
*  Everything drew back, whacked him, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4795.8s)]
*  watched him go 30 yards and pile up. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4799.04s)]
*  And it was watching the whole thing play. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4801.84s)]
*  At the end of it, then I was like, that was pretty calm. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4804.08s)]
*  I stayed pretty calm in that one. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4806.8s)]
*  For whatever reason, I stopped it as it was happening. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4808.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I would imagine the more reps you get in, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4812.88s)]
*  the easier it becomes. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4815.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but the next one was a month later. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4816.32s)]
*  I was super ramped up. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4818.92s)]
*  I think it was the stock part of it. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4820.68s)]
*  The creeping in is more sneaky than anything. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4822.8s)]
*  This was like an ambush. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4827.2s)]
*  There's something about creeping in on him. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4830.64s)]
*  Yeah, there's the momentum, right? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4832.92s)]
*  You're letting the drama build to the stories. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4834.56s)]
*  You're like, okay, we know what's gonna happen. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4837.4s)]
*  Do you think, have you talked about this with Cam? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4840.6s)]
*  Does he still get ramped up at all? [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4843.88s)]
*  He's pretty calm. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4846.52s)]
*  His resting heart rate has to be like three. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4849.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4851.08s)]
*  I think that certainly helps. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4852.76s)]
*  I think the amount of cardio that you do [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4854.96s)]
*  has an effect on how you can maintain your heart rate. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4856.88s)]
*  It just must. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4860.08s)]
*  It has to. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4861.12s)]
*  If someone has a low resting heart rate, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4862.0s)]
*  I would just imagine they'd have more control [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4864.24s)]
*  on bringing their heart down. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4866.8s)]
*  It just makes sense. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4868.96s)]
*  Totally makes sense. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4870.44s)]
*  He's done it so much, man. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4872.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4875.4s)]
*  He's a killer. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4876.24s)]
*  He knows how to stay calm under pressure. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4877.56s)]
*  And there was one yard kills, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4879.96s)]
*  that one video that he had. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4882.4s)]
*  Oh my God, that was insane. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4883.24s)]
*  That was crazy. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4884.4800000000005s)]
*  Dude. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4885.64s)]
*  One yard, a yard and a half or whatever he was [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4886.4800000000005s)]
*  from that thing. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4889.52s)]
*  It was as far as you are to me. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4890.36s)]
*  That's nuts. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4892.56s)]
*  Nuts. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4893.400000000001s)]
*  That guy, I went out and did his podcast [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4894.24s)]
*  a couple months ago. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4897.08s)]
*  We had so much fun. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4898.72s)]
*  He's such a fantastic human. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4900.56s)]
*  Very infrequently, do you just bump into people? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4903.92s)]
*  You're like, that guy's salt of the earth. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4908.04s)]
*  He's exactly, he's reached [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4909.56s)]
*  and then he's gone way above expectation [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4914.12s)]
*  as far as the type of person he is. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4916.8s)]
*  He's awesome. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4918.52s)]
*  Yeah, he's an amazing person. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4919.4400000000005s)]
*  So this dude named Schaefer, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4921.04s)]
*  he made a rap song about Cam. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4922.96s)]
*  We played it on the podcast the other day. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4925.32s)]
*  It's number eight in the hip hop charts now. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4927.72s)]
*  Seriously? [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4930.32s)]
*  In the all round hip hop charts. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4931.16s)]
*  And it was number, no, I think it's number six now. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4933.6s)]
*  And it was number like 90 in all songs. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4936.56s)]
*  It's a rap song about a bow hunter [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4941.44s)]
*  and it's number six in the hip hop charts. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4944.24s)]

*  Saturday night I cheated. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4982.32s)]
*  I had sushi, but sushi was great, [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4983.5599999999995s)]
*  but I felt like shit afterwards. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4986.08s)]
*  I felt like I ate a brick. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4987.639999999999s)]
*  I never feel like that if I just eat. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4989.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's just right. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4990.96s)]
*  I eat a lot though. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4991.8s)]
*  I overate. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4992.639999999999s)]
*  I overordered and they were really nice [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4993.48s)]
*  and I felt obligated to keep eating. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4995.5199999999995s)]
*  Thanksgiving you don't do potatoes, nothing like that. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=4997.599999999999s)]
*  I did this Thanksgiving. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5000.08s)]
*  But most other days, like today for breakfast, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5001.599999999999s)]
*  I had elk sausage, eggs and bacon. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5005.08s)]
*  That's a normal breakfast for me. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5010.04s)]
*  Hmm, yeah. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5010.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5011.72s)]
*  I steer clear of, I think I just meat, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5012.96s)]
*  vegetables and a limited amount of fruit. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5017.12s)]
*  Because I still like vegetables. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5019.4s)]
*  That's the problem with. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5021.24s)]
*  Yeah, I like vegetables. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5022.08s)]
*  I like bok choy. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5023.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5025.08s)]
*  Yeah, I like squash. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5025.92s)]
*  We had some sweet potatoes the other night [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5026.76s)]
*  that were great. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5028.8s)]
*  But I've completely cut out everything else. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5031.08s)]
*  I don't drink hardly at all. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5033.64s)]
*  Very, very limited. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5036.64s)]
*  Everything is gone. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5039.5199999999995s)]
*  Like no breads, no rice. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5040.76s)]
*  That's good. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5042.16s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5043.0s)]
*  If you can do that, you'll feel better. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5043.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5045.16s)]
*  It sounds nuts, but the way he described it, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5046.0s)]
*  and the studies that he shows, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5048.92s)]
*  it's like there's enough evidence to point to [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5051.28s)]
*  that at least for some people, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5053.44s)]
*  that's a very beneficial way to eat and live. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5054.64s)]
*  But I think really what it is, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5057.36s)]
*  is this thing of eating only meat. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5058.76s)]
*  I think for sure meat's very nutritious, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5061.88s)]
*  but I think a big factor in that [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5064.72s)]
*  is that you're just cutting out all the crap. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5067.08s)]
*  And if you just eat only meat and organic vegetables, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5069.96s)]
*  I don't think that's bad. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5072.16s)]
*  I don't buy it. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5074.0s)]
*  I don't buy that salads are bad for you. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5075.2s)]
*  I think that's crazy. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5076.72s)]
*  And it's good. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5078.4s)]
*  It tastes good. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5079.56s)]
*  Tastes good. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5080.4s)]
*  I think what's bad is the shit they spray on them. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5081.24s)]
*  For sure. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5083.28s)]
*  Glyphosate is bad. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5084.1s)]
*  Seed oils are bad. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5085.6s)]
*  No one's out there saying seed oils, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5087.12s)]
*  industrialized seed oils are good for you. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5088.84s)]
*  They're not, but olive oil's good for you. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5091.48s)]
*  So you could have olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5093.12s)]
*  on a nice salad. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5095.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't think that's bad. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5096.44s)]
*  Some heirloom tomatoes, some onions, some olives. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5098.84s)]
*  My wife did a whole gardening thing this year. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5103.68s)]
*  That's nice. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5107.4800000000005s)]
*  So we had this giant garden with heirloom tomatoes [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5108.84s)]
*  and a bunch of stuff. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5113.56s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5114.400000000001s)]
*  It was awesome. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5115.24s)]
*  Dude, when you get an heirloom tomato right off the vine, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5116.08s)]
*  slice that bad boy up, put a little salt on it, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5118.64s)]
*  little balsamic vinaigrette. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5121.36s)]
*  Chop up some avocados. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5123.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5124.72s)]
*  Dude, it's amazing. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5125.56s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5126.400000000001s)]
*  Is there anything that's worse for the environment [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5128.72s)]
*  than avocados? [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5129.72s)]
*  It's like avocados and almonds, I think. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5130.72s)]
*  Yeah, almonds. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5133.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's like 10 gallons of water for one almond. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5134.24s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5137.96s)]
*  You see people shoveling them down. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5138.8s)]
*  You're like, oh, there's where all California's water goes, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5140.6s)]
*  right there. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5143.76s)]
*  Oh, but I was reading this thing recently, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5144.6s)]
*  but I think the discovery was from 2021 [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5147.9800000000005s)]
*  about a new, very inexpensive method of desalination. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5151.4400000000005s)]
*  Is that how you say it? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5157.4s)]
*  Salination? [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5158.24s)]
*  I know what you mean. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5159.0599999999995s)]
*  How do you say that? [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5160.36s)]
*  How do you say the word? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5161.2s)]
*  But anyway, removing salt from water [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5163.08s)]
*  so that you could use ocean water, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5165.04s)]
*  but that they were gonna be able to have them available [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5167.48s)]
*  in like a home size version. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5170.54s)]
*  It's like not even that big, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5172.879999999999s)]
*  like a suitcase size, I think it is. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5174.32s)]
*  Really? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5175.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they can literally desalinate the water [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5176.58s)]
*  that comes from the ocean [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5179.2s)]
*  and you could turn it into drinking water. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5180.32s)]
*  That's like a game changer. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5182.879999999999s)]
*  Game changer. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5183.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5184.799999999999s)]
*  I've always said, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5185.64s)]
*  like I used to have a bit about people wanting to go to Mars [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5186.4800000000005s)]
*  and you know, like America, we have a water problem. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5189.68s)]
*  I go, we're right next to the fucking ocean. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5194.360000000001s)]
*  The last thing we have in California is a water problem. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5197.52s)]
*  We have a salt problem. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5200.200000000001s)]
*  There's so much fucking water. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5201.72s)]
*  It could eat us up. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5203.96s)]
*  It could literally devour the entire state [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5206.0s)]
*  with one giant wave [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5208.320000000001s)]
*  and we could be living on the beach in Arizona. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5209.88s)]
*  Like this fucking thing moves all the time. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5211.92s)]
*  There's so much water. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5214.26s)]
*  We don't have a water problem. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5215.9400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5218.26s)]
*  We have a salt problem. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5219.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5219.92s)]
*  I think the Israelis have actually figured that out. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5221.1s)]
*  They have like full plants that they're out there doing. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5223.3s)]
*  I'm gonna send this to you Jamie, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5227.46s)]
*  because I saved, I think I screenshotted it [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5228.5s)]
*  with the intention of looking it up later [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5231.26s)]
*  to make sure it's legitimate, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5233.18s)]
*  but I'm pretty sure it is. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5234.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5237.74s)]
*  How much stuff do you typically, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5239.9800000000005s)]
*  when you're thinking about, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5243.58s)]
*  how many episodes have you done now? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5245.5s)]
*  2000 something. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5247.7s)]
*  2000? [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5248.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5249.78s)]
*  And then a bunch of Fight Companions [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5250.6s)]
*  and then a bunch of MMA shows. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5251.62s)]
*  So it's more than 2000. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5253.68s)]
*  When you think about all the different pieces [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5255.66s)]
*  of information that you've cataloged in your head [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5256.9800000000005s)]
*  with all these different interviews, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5260.900000000001s)]
*  I can't imagine like the information that you've put out too [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5263.78s)]
*  just in terabytes as far as the volume is concerned. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5267.06s)]
*  Now you've got interviews with Elon, from Jordan, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5269.98s)]
*  from all these different people. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5274.219999999999s)]
*  That's so much information. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5276.5s)]
*  How much do you think that you've been able to [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5278.54s)]
*  just store in your head? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5280.74s)]
*  Not so much. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5282.299999999999s)]
*  Desalination system could produce fresh water [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5284.9s)]

*  salt clogging issues of other designs. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5294.139999999999s)]
*  This is from September 27th of 2023. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5296.219999999999s)]
*  So this, I wanna know why I thought it was earlier than that. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5299.26s)]
*  I found this very similar titled article from a year ago [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5302.26s)]
*  and even 2021 too. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5305.26s)]
*  Okay, that's probably where I saw it. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5307.06s)]
*  So engineers at MIT and in China [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5308.9800000000005s)]
*  are aiming to turn seawater into drinking water [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5311.7s)]
*  with a completely passive device [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5313.72s)]
*  that is inspired by the ocean and then powered by the sun. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5315.42s)]
*  That's fucking amazing. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5318.42s)]
*  This is where science is incredible. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5320.3s)]
*  The configuration of the device allows water to circulate [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5323.5s)]
*  in swirling eddies in a manner similar to much larger, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5326.26s)]
*  hmm, what's that word? [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5329.9400000000005s)]
*  Thermo-haline circulation of the ocean. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5330.860000000001s)]
*  This circulation combined with the sun's heat [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5334.1s)]
*  drives water to evaporate, leaving the salt behind. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5336.3s)]
*  The resulting water vapor could then be condensed [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5339.1s)]
*  and collected as pure drinkable water. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5341.14s)]
*  In the meantime, the leftover salt continues to circulate [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5343.42s)]
*  through and out of the device [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5346.3s)]
*  rather than accumulating and clogging the system. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5348.26s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5350.9400000000005s)]
*  And then also, couldn't you just recapture the salt [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5352.02s)]
*  and use it? [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5354.780000000001s)]
*  Produces about four to six liters [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5356.22s)]
*  of drinking water per hour and lasts several years [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5357.98s)]
*  before requiring replacement parts. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5360.54s)]
*  One of the things that Gary Brekow is saying [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5362.7s)]
*  that I found shocking was that some Himalayan salt, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5365.08s)]
*  like you always think of Himalayan salt [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5370.22s)]
*  as super healthy, he said, no, some of it has mercury in it [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5371.74s)]
*  because some of it, the way they mine it, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5375.74s)]
*  if they get too close to certain areas that contain mercury, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5378.22s)]
*  it can be contaminated with mercury. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5382.26s)]
*  And he was recommending Celtic salt over Himalayan salt. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5384.26s)]
*  See if we can find any articles on that. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5389.42s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5390.26s)]
*  So you can actually get Celtic salt. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5391.1s)]
*  Yeah, Celtic salt. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5394.14s)]
*  I didn't even know. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5394.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know, because you just order it. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5395.8s)]
*  You gotta hope they're telling the truth. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5397.58s)]
*  One thing I found out through this lady [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5399.3s)]
*  that was a beekeeper that came on here, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5400.42s)]
*  she goes, a lot of the honey you buy is bullshit. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5401.7s)]
*  Like when people are buying honey, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5403.860000000001s)]
*  they're buying like corn syrup. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5405.06s)]
*  They think they're buying honey. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5406.280000000001s)]
*  It's like some honey. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5407.18s)]
*  It's like drugs. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5408.18s)]
*  They're cutting it with baby powder. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5409.66s)]
*  Yeah, one of my really close friends, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5411.62s)]
*  that's what he does, he's a beekeeper. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5415.099999999999s)]
*  So I've been out there like helping him with the bees. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5416.82s)]
*  Oh, it's saying Celtic sea salt and Himalayan sea salt [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5419.66s)]
*  can expose your children to too much lead, mercury, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5422.7s)]
*  and other heavy metals. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5425.22s)]
*  Whoa, so Celtic salt can have it too. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5426.86s)]
*  So none detected. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5430.9s)]
*  So it looks like, what's the best salt? [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5432.7s)]
*  So Celtic gray sea salt, [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5435.76s)]
*  it seems like it has a lot of mercury. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5438.66s)]
*  It's lead. It's as blue as lead. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5439.98s)]
*  It's a lot of lead. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5442.3s)]
*  Mediterranean sea salt. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5443.14s)]
*  So what has the least lead seems like Israeli sea salt. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5444.1s)]
*  Of course it does. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5448.58s)]
*  I don't know who made this test. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5451.58s)]
*  Did the Israel Times put this out? [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5453.66s)]
*  There is mercury though. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5458.86s)]
*  No pink salt does not contain mercury. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5459.94s)]
*  Unrefined sea salt. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5462.66s)]
*  There is, so it's controversial. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5464.02s)]
*  Minerals in it, but also other minerals in it. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5466.02s)]
*  But who's saying it doesn't include mercury? [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5468.94s)]
*  Where does it say no? [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5472.5s)]
*  You said no, sea salt does not. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5473.379999999999s)]
*  I said pink salt. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5475.219999999999s)]
*  It didn't say sea salt. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5476.0599999999995s)]
*  It said specifically pink salt. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5476.9s)]
*  No pink salt does not contain mercury. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5478.379999999999s)]
*  Okay, but some can. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5480.94s)]
*  But I, that's a, I mean. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5482.78s)]
*  Is that people that are selling it? [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5483.98s)]
*  Yes, this is from Nepal. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5485.42s)]
*  Okay, maybe from Nepal it doesn't contain mercury. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5486.74s)]
*  What they were saying, I think what Gary Brecker was saying [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5489.58s)]
*  was some of it is from China that contains mercury. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5492.099999999999s)]
*  Well, that's not Himalayan then is it? [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5495.54s)]
*  Well, I guess it technically. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5497.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5498.9s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5499.74s)]
*  I mean, when I'm buying salt, I'm not really looking into it. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5500.58s)]
*  You know what's really fucking good? [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5502.82s)]
*  What is that? [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5504.34s)]
*  There's this veteran owned company. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5505.18s)]
*  Is it Firecracker? [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5506.74s)]
*  Firecracker, dude. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5507.58s)]

*  If, here's something that you can do, [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5514.5s)]
*  which is you put a little bit of that in your coffee. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5517.1s)]
*  Tony, dude, it's good. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5519.34s)]

*  And then just fucking enjoying my time. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5811.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5814.66s)]
*  That's it. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5815.5s)]
*  I think we were talking about this in California. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5816.78s)]
*  Did you build this here, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5820.1s)]
*  like as part of like getting reps in, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5823.14s)]
*  just getting rep after rep. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5825.54s)]
*  The club. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5826.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5827.34s)]
*  Well, I built it because there wasn't a home base here. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5828.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5829.74s)]
*  You know, when all these comics came out with me, [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5830.58s)]
*  when we moved out and we found out [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5832.58s)]
*  that we could perform in Austin. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5834.82s)]
*  And for comedians, like performing is like a drug. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5836.06s)]
*  So like you can't perform. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5838.58s)]
*  Like LA shut everything down for so long. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5839.58s)]
*  And then the grapevine got out that like from November, 2020, [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5842.06s)]
*  we were doing shows here, totally irresponsibly, indoors. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5845.94s)]
*  And they were like, what? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5849.5s)]
*  They're doing comedy indoors in Austin? [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5851.0599999999995s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5852.7s)]
*  They packed shows and put them up on Instagram. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5853.54s)]
*  People were like, what the fuck? [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5855.46s)]
*  This is nuts. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5856.78s)]
*  And so many comics started moving here. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5858.179999999999s)]
*  And then I realized what we missed about LA, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5861.7s)]
*  we missed about the comedy store was that was home base. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5863.7s)]
*  And that you need, like comedians need a community. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5866.299999999999s)]
*  You need like a home club. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5869.179999999999s)]
*  You need where a bunch of comics hang out. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5870.98s)]
*  You fuel each other. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5872.86s)]
*  Everybody inspires each other. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5874.7s)]
*  You know, when you're seeing these guys like Brian Simpson [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5876.54s)]
*  going up and murdering, he's doing all this new material. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5878.7s)]
*  Shane Gillis is going up and murdering. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5880.82s)]
*  Tony Hinchcliffe is going up and murdering. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5882.62s)]
*  There's like a feeling in the building. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5884.38s)]
*  Like there's an excitement to the building. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5887.139999999999s)]
*  And that's what I wanted to create here. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5889.3s)]
*  I wanted to create a real home for these comics. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5891.3s)]
*  And I also wanted to create a real development platform. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5894.3s)]
*  I think that was, that's a key part of comedy clubs [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5897.139999999999s)]
*  that's missing from these places that just want to make money. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5900.58s)]
*  Because you could take your Sunday and Monday [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5903.58s)]
*  and just bring in headliners and pack the house [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5905.82s)]
*  and make a lot of money. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5908.06s)]
*  Or you can do open mic nights and develop talent [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5909.9s)]
*  and have these people have a real opportunity [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5913.78s)]
*  to get up at the best comedy club on earth [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5916.74s)]
*  for the very first time ever. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5918.74s)]
*  And go up and do a couple of minutes of jokes [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5920.26s)]
*  and see if you can get a laugh. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5922.78s)]
*  And you never know. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5924.06s)]
*  You might be good. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5925.22s)]
*  You might have it in you. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5926.3s)]
*  You might be that fuck up in school [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5927.18s)]
*  that they always told you you're gonna be a loser, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5929.34s)]
*  but you have a funny way of saying things. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5931.02s)]
*  And you go up and maybe you have some insight [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5933.860000000001s)]
*  that other people, maybe they would be too scared to say, [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5935.540000000001s)]
*  or maybe they wouldn't notice it, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5938.580000000001s)]
*  or maybe you'd point something out. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5940.06s)]
*  You never fucking know. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5941.38s)]
*  And the only way you get to develop talent [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5942.3s)]
*  is if you have some sort of a place for people to perform [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5945.9800000000005s)]
*  that aren't any good, that are just starting out. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5949.18s)]
*  So we set aside two nights for that. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5951.38s)]
*  Every Sunday and every Monday, we have open mic night. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5953.700000000001s)]
*  And we also have people that work there [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5956.06s)]
*  are aspiring comedians. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5957.9800000000005s)]
*  All the door people, they all had to audition with their act. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5959.66s)]
*  So the talent coordinator, Adam, [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5965.18s)]
*  had to go and watch them perform. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5967.98s)]
*  And there was this giant audition for door people, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5970.74s)]
*  for people to get jobs at the club. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5973.9s)]
*  So there's this feeling in the club [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5975.9s)]
*  like everybody's coming up. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5977.66s)]
*  Everybody's coming up together. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5979.42s)]
*  When everybody's doing good. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5981.14s)]
*  Ehsan, who's just a fucking amazing dude [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5982.7s)]
*  and hilarious comedian who's at the club all the time, [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5986.18s)]
*  he said, whenever something happens with the door people [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5988.46s)]
*  or anybody else in the club, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5992.3s)]
*  everybody always says, we up, we up. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5994.3s)]
*  I'm like, that's amazing. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5997.34s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5998.86s)]
*  Something cool happens, we up, we up. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=5999.9800000000005s)]
*  And they'll yell it. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6002.42s)]
*  Like, it's great. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6003.26s)]
*  So that environment, that's what I wanted to create. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6004.74s)]
*  That was the goal. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6008.74s)]
*  But it's way better than I thought it could be. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6009.9800000000005s)]
*  It's like, I had an idea. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6011.78s)]
*  I was like, let's just do it the best we can. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6014.66s)]
*  And turns out you got some Spotify money. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6016.58s)]
*  You can throw in a problem. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6020.74s)]
*  You can make it really good [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6022.38s)]
*  and have it set up where the comedians [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6024.0599999999995s)]
*  get paid really well and everybody gets taken care of [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6026.34s)]
*  and you feel really good about it. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6028.98s)]
*  And it's a fun place to work. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6030.38s)]
*  And it's a good environment for everybody. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6032.26s)]
*  That's what I wanted. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6033.82s)]
*  So that's what we put together. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6034.9s)]
*  It almost seems like the center of gravity from comedy [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6036.78s)]
*  has moved off the coast to Austin. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6042.14s)]
*  And I think, and I'm probably not the first person [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6045.62s)]
*  to say that, but you're the guy [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6048.7s)]
*  that has kind of moved the epicenter of comedy over here. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6051.0199999999995s)]
*  I would imagine that. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6054.46s)]
*  Well, I gave him a spot. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6055.299999999999s)]
*  I created a spot. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6056.12s)]
*  I mean, it was me because I financed it and it was my idea. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6056.96s)]
*  But it was also, we all need a spot. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6060.66s)]
*  And if one of us can do it and put it together, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6063.5s)]
*  I'm a good person to do that. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6066.62s)]
*  Because that's what I like to do. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6068.219999999999s)]
*  I like to help people. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6069.9s)]
*  I like to blow people up. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6071.0599999999995s)]
*  I really do. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6072.339999999999s)]
*  I love to have people on that I think are talented [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6073.34s)]
*  and let the world know about them. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6076.08s)]
*  And I like to, when I talk about things, [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6077.42s)]
*  whether it's on my Instagram or on the podcast, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6080.24s)]
*  99% of the time, I have no affiliation with those things. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6083.900000000001s)]
*  I just think these are good things. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6087.400000000001s)]
*  People should see these good things. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6089.3s)]
*  I don't think, oh, I should get a piece of that. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6090.84s)]
*  I just think these are good things. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6093.5s)]
*  These good things should make more money. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6095.1s)]
*  This business should be bigger. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6096.54s)]
*  This comedian should be more popular. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6098.26s)]
*  This musician should be known. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6100.26s)]
*  People should read this book. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6101.92s)]
*  These are good things. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6103.54s)]
*  Just put good things out as much as you can. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6104.38s)]
*  And so that was my idea with this comedy club. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6106.700000000001s)]
*  Just get great comics, pay them well, [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6108.38s)]
*  and have a place where people can go [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6111.3s)]
*  where they know that they're gonna be able [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6113.68s)]
*  to work on their act. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6115.3s)]
*  Everyone's phone's locked up [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6116.46s)]
*  so that people aren't distracted [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6117.9800000000005s)]
*  and they're not filming things [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6119.34s)]
*  and just having a good fucking time, enjoying this. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6120.3s)]
*  Let's just work together and fucking all get better together [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6123.42s)]
*  and have a real home base. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6127.34s)]
*  And I had the ability to do it. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6129.780000000001s)]
*  And so I said, it's kind of my obligation to do it. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6131.22s)]
*  The universe put me in this place [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6133.900000000001s)]
*  where all of a sudden I moved out of LA, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6135.740000000001s)]
*  all of a sudden I'm in Texas, [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6138.9400000000005s)]
*  and all these other comedians come out here with me. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6140.26s)]
*  And I'm like, who's gonna do it if I'm not doing it? [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6143.58s)]
*  I have to do it. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6145.18s)]
*  So we just went and did it. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6146.02s)]
*  And with a fucking grab of, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6147.5s)]
*  Ron White grabbed me by my shoulders [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6149.38s)]
*  when he got off stage. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6150.860000000001s)]
*  The first time he got on stage, [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6152.26s)]
*  he hadn't done stand up in like over a year, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6153.54s)]
*  I think it was, or close to it. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6156.02s)]
*  And he grabs me by my shoulders. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6157.7s)]
*  Whatever the fuck we gotta do. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6159.38s)]
*  He goes, you're gonna open up that club. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6161.82s)]
*  We're gonna do this. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6163.18s)]
*  Like he hadn't done stand up in so long. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6164.74s)]
*  And he was so, he fucking murdered. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6167.38s)]
*  And he went on stage and there was this giant [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6169.46s)]
*  standing ovation. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6170.9800000000005s)]
*  It was insane. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6171.86s)]
*  I wish we filmed it, [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6173.34s)]
*  because it was such a beautiful moment. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6174.7s)]
*  It was his first time doing stand up forever. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6176.54s)]
*  And he was kind of genuinely like concerned about it. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6179.1s)]
*  He listened to his material, he went over his notes, [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6181.9800000000005s)]
*  he worked on it all fucking day. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6184.46s)]
*  And so he went up that night, [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6186.78s)]
*  he was just on it, just on it. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6187.94s)]
*  And so Ron White is like, he's a good friend, [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6191.82s)]
*  but he's also kind of a hero. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6195.259999999999s)]
*  Like to me, like in comedy, he's like, he's a legend. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6197.419999999999s)]
*  So we have Ron White here? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6200.219999999999s)]
*  Like of course, what do you wanna do? [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6203.099999999999s)]
*  You wanna open up a club? [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6204.5s)]
*  I'll buy a club. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6205.339999999999s)]
*  I'm like, let's do it. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6206.179999999999s)]
*  And so that was the, this was the second place I bought. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6208.54s)]
*  I told you about the first place, it was owned by a cult. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6212.9s)]
*  He told me to buy that place too. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6215.099999999999s)]
*  You did? [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6216.9s)]
*  You should buy that place owned by the cult. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6218.9s)]
*  Fucking beautiful theater. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6220.0599999999995s)]
*  It was on BK's road, fucking gorgeous theater. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6222.58s)]
*  Owned by a cult. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6225.86s)]
*  Boy, then I watched the cult document, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6227.339999999999s)]
*  I'm like, oh fucking no, what is this? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6229.0199999999995s)]
*  What happened here? [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6232.139999999999s)]
*  It's, there's so much bad juju going on in that building. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6233.62s)]
*  So many bad vibes, so many people lost their lives. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6236.9s)]
*  Like literally lost their lives forever in that building. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6239.86s)]
*  That's fucking wild. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6243.78s)]
*  It's wild, yeah. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6244.9s)]
*  It's still a theater. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6246.58s)]
*  I think they still do shows there. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6247.46s)]
*  They built that theater for that dude [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6249.42s)]
*  to dance in front of his followers. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6251.06s)]
*  That's like a whole other, that's a whole other segway. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6252.9s)]
*  It's like how crazy cult leaders are [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6258.74s)]
*  and what type of personality that person is [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6262.9800000000005s)]
*  and like what happens to people. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6265.42s)]
*  I love those mockumentaries that a few people have done [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6267.74s)]
*  around cult leaders. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6271.46s)]
*  I think there's a series on Netflix [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6272.94s)]
*  that went into like a three part episode. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6274.62s)]
*  How to be a cult leader, I think it's called. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6276.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking hilarious. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6278.66s)]
*  Well, it's just like you were talking about before. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6280.139999999999s)]
*  Well, 15% of the people have an IQ lower than 85 [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6282.62s)]
*  and some people just wanna be led. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6285.94s)]
*  There's a bunch of people, a bunch, [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6287.86s)]
*  who are really lost and never develop the tools [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6291.5s)]
*  to be personally responsible for themselves. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6296.54s)]
*  They never develop the ability to be autonomous. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6302.099999999999s)]
*  They never develop the ability to have their own thoughts [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6304.78s)]
*  and the objective analysis of all the information [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6308.38s)]
*  and coming up with a rational conclusion. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6313.3s)]
*  They don't have people around them [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6315.0199999999995s)]
*  that could bounce these ideas off that they respect, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6316.219999999999s)]
*  that they can go, what about this? [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6318.9s)]
*  And that person go, yeah, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6320.9s)]
*  but you have to also consider this. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6321.74s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, you do, right? [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6323.259999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6324.38s)]
*  Hmm, okay, so what is really going on? [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6325.219999999999s)]
*  Like they don't have that in their life [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6327.179999999999s)]
*  and so some fucking dude comes along [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6328.58s)]
*  and he's wearing speedos and he does yoga [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6330.3s)]
*  and he tells you he can give you the knowing [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6332.74s)]
*  and you can be in touch with God [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6334.3s)]
*  and you just fucking, you buy into it [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6336.3s)]
*  and it feels better than being by yourself [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6338.3s)]
*  and you're hanging out with all these people [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6341.02s)]
*  and everyone's cooking together [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6342.14s)]
*  and you're doing yoga together. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6343.22s)]
*  Seems good. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6344.9800000000005s)]

*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6349.38s)]
*  You remember that? [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6350.22s)]
*  Yeah, that was great. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6351.06s)]
*  Me and my friend Todd were talking about this once [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6351.88s)]
*  and he's a real sweet guy, he's a funny guy, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6353.46s)]
*  but he was like, in the beginning he was like, [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6356.46s)]
*  God, I wanna live like that. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6358.14s)]
*  He goes, it all goes bad at the end, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6359.66s)]
*  but in the beginning, we're like, [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6362.1s)]
*  God, I wanna live like that. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6363.18s)]
*  I kinda wanna live like that too. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6364.5s)]
*  Everybody wants to be a part of something bigger than them [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6366.38s)]
*  and especially if it's like a cool community [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6369.54s)]
*  where everybody's nice to each other [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6372.54s)]
*  and you're all connected to God [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6374.06s)]

*  and hope throughout the world. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6381.12s)]
*  Seems great in the beginning. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6383.5s)]
*  Yeah, it seems utopic. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6385.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6387.34s)]
*  It's like a drug. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6388.18s)]
*  I think people have this natural inclination [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6389.0s)]
*  to look towards a leader. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6391.94s)]
*  So it's like looking towards an alpha chimp in a pack [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6393.339999999999s)]
*  or the leader of a tribe is a natural inclination [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6395.86s)]
*  to look to someone who gets it [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6398.219999999999s)]
*  and if your brain's not that good, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6399.98s)]
*  someone can come along [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6402.7s)]

*  Like. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6410.78s)]
*  You can. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6411.62s)]
*  You can convince them. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6412.46s)]
*  You can fucking sell it. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6414.339999999999s)]
*  If you're, especially if you're successful, [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6415.94s)]
*  like if you're running like a giant church, [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6418.66s)]
*  clearly you must know what you're doing. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6421.94s)]
*  You just pulled up in a Rolls Royce. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6423.18s)]
*  This guy knows what he's doing. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6424.62s)]
*  He's a cult leader. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6425.82s)]
*  He comes out. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6426.66s)]
*  People are like opening the door for him. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6427.48s)]
*  They're calling him the beloved. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6428.74s)]
*  They're like, he must be legit. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6430.38s)]
*  Maybe I found the real guy. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6431.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6433.7s)]
*  A real guy who's attached to God energy. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6434.54s)]
*  How do you think about that from a leadership perspective? [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6438.78s)]
*  You know, you've had a ton of guys on, [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6442.54s)]
*  but you find yourself as a leader. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6443.98s)]
*  You find yourself as a voice. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6447.62s)]
*  Like, does that come natural? [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6448.84s)]
*  Is that something that you? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6450.02s)]
*  Do my best to be like the best version of me that I can be. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6451.259999999999s)]
*  And if that also, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6456.82s)]
*  if part of that is talking about the things [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6459.9s)]
*  that I've learned, then I do that. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6462.0599999999995s)]
*  But there's no part of me that says like, [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6464.139999999999s)]
*  I need to be a leader. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6467.46s)]
*  There's no, I don't, [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6468.799999999999s)]
*  I think you could really fuck your head up [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6469.78s)]
*  if you start believing that. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6471.74s)]
*  And I think that's where the cult starts. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6473.099999999999s)]
*  That's what the cult started, guys. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6474.9s)]
*  I'm a leader. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6476.099999999999s)]
*  I need to teach these people. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6476.94s)]
*  They need to follow my way. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6478.58s)]
*  It's like, probably not. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6479.66s)]
*  Maybe you need a leader too. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6483.5s)]
*  Maybe everybody needs to like work together. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6484.78s)]
*  Maybe that's a better option. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6487.26s)]
*  Like, I think the whole leader thing is like, [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6489.18s)]
*  there might be people that you admire [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6491.46s)]
*  or you see them as someone who is a great example [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6493.78s)]
*  of how to live life. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6497.42s)]
*  Like whether it's Jaco or many of these people [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6498.26s)]
*  that like put that out there. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6501.139999999999s)]
*  Like Jaco is one of the best examples of it. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6502.62s)]
*  Like he's written books about extreme ownership. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6504.26s)]
*  And those are, there's valuable, valuable lessons [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6507.02s)]
*  in that kind of stuff. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6509.74s)]
*  But I think even with guys like him, it comes natural. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6511.22s)]
*  It is just like this, [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6516.1s)]
*  he is just telling you what he learned. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6517.12s)]
*  This is real. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6519.5s)]
*  This is what you need to do. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6520.7s)]
*  If you wanna get ahead, [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6521.7s)]
*  you gotta fucking take accountability for your own life. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6522.64s)]
*  You gotta embrace your fuck ups, embrace your failures, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6525.46s)]
*  figure out what you did wrong, regroup, get back after it. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6528.54s)]
*  Those are super valuable lessons. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6532.38s)]
*  And you can call him a leader [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6534.54s)]
*  because of those lessons. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6535.9s)]
*  But really what he's leading [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6536.98s)]
*  is an example of an excellent life. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6538.299999999999s)]
*  And that is the best thing that we do for each other. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6541.0599999999995s)]
*  We lead by example. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6543.58s)]
*  So you can see a guy who like, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6545.339999999999s)]
*  I was hanging out with this friend of mine [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6548.08s)]
*  who's this very wealthy guy who owns all these businesses. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6549.219999999999s)]
*  And one of the things that I was like super inspired by [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6552.299999999999s)]
*  is how nice he is to everyone, to everyone, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6556.5s)]
*  everyone he meets. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6559.42s)]
*  He's super friendly and engaging and but genuine. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6560.379999999999s)]
*  Like I'm with him all the time. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6563.78s)]
*  So I know if he's turning it on or turning it off, [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6564.96s)]
*  it's never off. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6566.76s)]
*  He's like genuinely, [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6567.8s)]
*  and he doesn't have any time for negativity. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6569.08s)]
*  He doesn't use email, he doesn't fuck with social media. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6571.36s)]
*  And he's a multi-billionaire. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6573.92s)]
*  And he's just running his life with a smile on his face [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6575.96s)]
*  and genuinely engaging with people. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6580.24s)]
*  That guy's a leader by example. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6582.52s)]
*  That's a beautiful way to live your life. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6584.96s)]
*  If you can do that, you can be very successful [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6587.22s)]
*  but never turn into a tyrant, that's amazing. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6589.56s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6592.4s)]
*  Because most people they take the easy way [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6593.42s)]
*  and they turn into a tyrant. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6594.9400000000005s)]
*  Everybody around them is walking on eggshells, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6596.3s)]
*  they yell at people. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6597.86s)]
*  You always hear about that with talk show hosts. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6599.06s)]
*  And you always hear about that with like people [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6600.74s)]
*  that are leading a sitcom, they just yell at everybody, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6602.82s)]
*  shut the fuck up and listen to me. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6605.3s)]
*  I'm the star of this show. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6607.62s)]
*  Like that kind of shit. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6608.9800000000005s)]
*  You always used to hear about that, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6610.74s)]
*  especially before the internet. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6611.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean some of the best leadership examples [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6613.58s)]
*  that I've had in my life were guys that were bad, [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6616.34s)]
*  toxic leaders because you're like, [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6618.38s)]
*  I do not want to be even close to that guy. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6620.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6623.5s)]
*  And I've had just the, I guess, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6624.34s)]
*  the fortunate opportunity to serve under [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6628.5s)]
*  some really incredible people and with amazing people [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6631.7s)]
*  that they just inspire you through action. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6635.02s)]
*  And one of those guys I've had a really close relationship [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6638.22s)]
*  over the last few years is Johnny Morris, [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6642.18s)]
*  the founder of Bass Pro, and he's that guy. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6644.46s)]
*  Really? [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6647.38s)]
*  He's so humble. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6648.22s)]
*  The founder of Bass Pro shops? [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6649.06s)]
*  He is so humble. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6649.9s)]
*  He is so nice. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6650.94s)]
*  He is so genuine. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6651.94s)]
*  We went elk hunting a few years ago. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6653.379999999999s)]
*  He called me, he's like, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6654.82s)]
*  Hey Evan, you want to go elk hunting? [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6655.86s)]
*  I was like, yeah, let's go. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6657.099999999999s)]
*  Like you don't say no to Johnny, right? [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6658.86s)]
*  You're not like, no, like of course, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6660.42s)]
*  of course I'm going to go. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6663.179999999999s)]
*  And one of the guys, he brought out one of the guys [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6664.74s)]
*  that plays in his bar there in Branson, Missouri. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6668.54s)]
*  And he shot an elk, we were tracking it. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6674.0599999999995s)]
*  Johnny's out there tracking it. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6676.94s)]
*  And he's like, hey guys, you guys want some water? [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6678.18s)]
*  Like runs down and grabs everybody some water [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6679.860000000001s)]
*  because we're putting in some miles. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6682.1s)]
*  He's driving the truck with us and stuff. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6683.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, the guys, I don't know how many stores [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6685.34s)]
*  that he's opened. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6689.46s)]
*  I don't know exactly what his individual wealth is, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6690.3s)]
*  but he's humble. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6693.14s)]
*  He's incredibly kind. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6694.9800000000005s)]
*  And he's always there to offer an opportunity for somebody. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6697.54s)]
*  We went out to one of his places in Arizona. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6701.9400000000005s)]
*  He just sat with me for a full day, [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6704.780000000001s)]
*  just talking about brand. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6707.5s)]
*  He's sitting on the couch in his slippers. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6710.58s)]
*  We're going through brand and kind of brand moments [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6713.62s)]
*  and how important those can be [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6716.54s)]
*  and how important it is for your customer. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6718.5s)]
*  The customer came up a thousand times. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6720.86s)]
*  Like how important this is. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6725.26s)]
*  And it's like those little pieces that I can pull away [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6726.82s)]
*  from incredible leaders, people that inspire me [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6730.14s)]
*  or whatever it is. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6733.18s)]
*  It's not only the good people that you can find [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6735.06s)]
*  where they're authentically engaging with you, [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6738.26s)]
*  but it's also the flip side to that where you're like, [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6740.38s)]
*  this guy is incredibly successful [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6743.3s)]
*  and there's another person that's very toxic [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6745.66s)]
*  and they're not engaging people in an authentic way. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6747.7s)]
*  I don't wanna be even close to those people. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6750.62s)]

*  It's like when people have alcoholic parents, [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6753.7s)]
*  they're in and out of jail, always getting arrested [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6757.02s)]

*  I know a lot of people who don't drink at all, [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6778.46s)]
*  not because they have a drinking problem, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6781.1s)]
*  but because someone in their family had a drinking problem. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6782.5s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why I've never done Coke. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6785.42s)]
*  I had a buddy of mine in high school [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6787.26s)]
*  and his cousin used to sell Coke [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6788.34s)]
*  and I watched his life fall apart. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6789.660000000001s)]
*  And I remember thinking, oh my God, [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6791.54s)]
*  this guy was fucking so normal and cool. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6794.42s)]
*  And now all of a sudden he's like a vampire, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6795.9s)]
*  like hiding and just doing Coke all the time. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6797.46s)]
*  Like they would hide in this attic apartment and do Coke. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6800.34s)]
*  Him and his girlfriend, they look pale [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6803.099999999999s)]

*  It's like the cocaine vampire came along and stole your life. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6808.0199999999995s)]
*  The cocaine vampire. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6811.259999999999s)]
*  Bro, that vampire steals people's lives. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6812.9s)]
*  I remember it from high school [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6815.62s)]
*  because it's not like there was a lot of coke heads [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6817.42s)]
*  in my neighborhood, but there was enough people [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6819.7s)]
*  that did Coke where you watched the change [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6821.34s)]
*  in their personality where it just all became [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6824.7s)]
*  about getting Coke. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6825.9s)]
*  They just wanted to get Coke. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6827.3s)]
*  I can imagine it's gotta be prevalent [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6829.5s)]
*  within the media world and in LA, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6832.0599999999995s)]

*  Not a lot though. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6843.74s)]
*  Not a lot. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6845.42s)]
*  It's not like it's something that, it's not like weed. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6846.54s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6864.26s)]

*  which is wild. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6866.74s)]

*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6872.0199999999995s)]
*  There's people that just like to party. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6873.42s)]
*  They just enjoy it enough that they disregard [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6875.3s)]
*  or ignore the performance negatives, [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6878.78s)]
*  which are very real. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6882.66s)]
*  If you're fucking ramping your system up with Coke A [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6884.26s)]
*  and you expect to perform at your best [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6887.0599999999995s)]
*  and you're doing it all the time, [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6889.14s)]
*  well there's no way, even if you're really talented, [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6890.099999999999s)]
*  you're taking a chunk out of your potential. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6892.0599999999995s)]
*  100%. For sure. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6894.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's where, [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6895.86s)]
*  especially if you're in a combat sport. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6897.66s)]
*  Yes. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6899.94s)]
*  Definitely, from my subculture, [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6900.78s)]
*  the people that I grew up with in the military, [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6903.14s)]
*  we're always concerned about brain injury, TBI. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6905.22s)]
*  I think one of the most positive benefits [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6910.18s)]
*  that the veteran community specifically can do [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6912.5s)]
*  is stop drinking, just stop. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6915.54s)]
*  Once you mix drugs and alcohol [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6918.54s)]
*  in an already compromised or could be compromised brain, [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6921.18s)]
*  you don't know what's gonna happen. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6925.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6927.02s)]
*  And I know that it's one of those things [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6927.860000000001s)]
*  that I've tried very hard to just eliminate [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6930.38s)]
*  out of my life because of that. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6933.780000000001s)]
*  I've lost too many friends to suicide specifically. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6935.1s)]
*  One in particular that was my best friend [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6938.22s)]
*  to just about a year ago. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6940.94s)]
*  And I guarantee it was because the mix of chemicals [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6943.98s)]
*  with a TBI, guaranteed. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6947.9s)]
*  TBI with fighters, one of the wild things [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6949.82s)]
*  is when you think a guy's punchy [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6955.219999999999s)]
*  and then you have a couple of drinks with them. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6956.86s)]
*  They get drunk so fast, like obliterated so fast. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6959.78s)]
*  Like you're pretty normal and they're gone. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6964.94s)]
*  And you're wondering like, wow, wonder what if, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6967.58s)]
*  like that whole brain, the whole punch drunk thing, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6970.5s)]
*  which people always used to call it punch drunk [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6973.54s)]
*  before they call it pugilistica dementia. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6975.42s)]
*  But punch drunk, they are kind of drunk [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6977.9s)]
*  and then you give them alcohol and they get really fucked up. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6981.78s)]
*  And there's a lot of people just walking around like that. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6986.36s)]
*  And also your endocrine system's disrupted, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6989.7s)]
*  your body's not producing dopamine [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6993.66s)]
*  or serotonin properly anymore [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6995.62s)]
*  because of the brain injuries. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6997.54s)]
*  And so then you're looking for something [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=6999.14s)]
*  to get you out of this fog of depression. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7001.14s)]
*  And a lot of them turn to drink it, [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7003.22s)]
*  which is crazy because it's a depressive. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7005.02s)]
*  It's the same. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7008.46s)]
*  It's very, very similar in the veteran community [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7009.3s)]
*  because guys will come out, they're redefining themselves, [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7012.660000000001s)]
*  trying to find purpose in their lives. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7016.320000000001s)]
*  They get depressed because they're dislocated [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7017.860000000001s)]
*  from their tribe, the people they've been emotionally, [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7020.360000000001s)]
*  physically, psychologically more connected to [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7023.46s)]
*  than sometimes their family. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7025.740000000001s)]
*  And then they are dealing with overpressure [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7029.62s)]
*  and or they've been blown up guaranteed [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7032.099999999999s)]
*  because even on internal breaches and explosives on targets, [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7033.94s)]
*  you're gonna be exposed [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7037.339999999999s)]
*  to the overpressure from the explosives. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7039.42s)]
*  You're going to have some type of impact on your brain. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7041.82s)]
*  Like I would say guaranteed [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7045.139999999999s)]
*  if you came out of the special operations community. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7046.86s)]
*  And then they switch and I've seen it, [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7049.46s)]
*  there's too many examples for me to list, [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7052.259999999999s)]
*  but I've seen it directly impact in a negative way [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7054.139999999999s)]
*  because they switched to alcohol [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7058.42s)]
*  and then they find themselves in the bottom of a bottle [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7060.74s)]
*  and it doesn't get better. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7064.34s)]
*  Like that doesn't improve their life [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7065.78s)]
*  in any way, shape or form. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7067.9s)]
*  There's an interim bandaid for it. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7070.02s)]
*  It might make you feel better for a short amount of time, [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7072.54s)]
*  but after a while, it puts you into a spiral. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7074.7s)]
*  And I've seen it happen too many times to count. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7079.62s)]
*  It affects you. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7085.5s)]
*  I mean, it directly affects me every day [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7086.86s)]
*  where whether it's the war itself [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7090.099999999999s)]
*  or the post effects of war, [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7094.22s)]
*  I've talked about this a few times where it's like, [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7097.46s)]
*  Iraq is with me every day of my life, [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7099.62s)]
*  whether I like it or don't like it, [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7101.46s)]
*  I've just dealt with it. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7103.18s)]
*  And now I'm just trying to do the best that I can [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7104.86s)]
*  to make sure that one, the machine is 100% capacity [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7108.78s)]
*  and two, that I can be an example for other guys to say, [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7113.06s)]
*  you know what, I don't have to. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7117.26s)]
*  I don't have to be in a social circumstance [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7118.18s)]
*  and have a drink. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7119.780000000001s)]
*  I can reach out to a friend. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7122.06s)]
*  Even if you just reach out to people now and again [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7124.18s)]
*  and just say, hey, what's up? [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7127.9400000000005s)]
*  How you doing? [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7128.860000000001s)]
*  Like that's it. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7129.700000000001s)]
*  It helps. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7130.54s)]
*  It does, it definitely helps. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7131.360000000001s)]
*  And I think that's one of the reasons [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7132.860000000001s)]
*  why fighters and military guys find each other a lot [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7138.18s)]
*  and there's a huge percentage of veterans [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7143.18s)]
*  that get into jiu-jitsu and some of the things [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7144.54s)]
*  after service, they're looking for a community, [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7146.7s)]
*  they're looking for a tribe, [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7149.54s)]
*  they're looking for something physical. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7150.82s)]
*  And I see a lot of parallels between that. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7154.0199999999995s)]
*  Makes sense. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7157.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7158.58s)]
*  I would think military guys like jiu-jitsu [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7159.82s)]
*  and martial arts would be an automatic, [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7162.94s)]
*  it makes sense, complete makes sense [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7164.82s)]
*  to help you transition. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7166.62s)]
*  And also just a great thing to keep your head in check, [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7168.9s)]
*  keep your mind right. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7172.02s)]
*  It's martial arts, particularly jiu-jitsu [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7173.22s)]
*  is a really good one because there's no head impacts [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7175.38s)]
*  and you can keep your mind right. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7177.900000000001s)]
*  The problem with sparring, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7179.820000000001s)]
*  like if you get into striking sports, [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7181.18s)]
*  you're getting damaged, whether you believe it or not. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7184.080000000001s)]
*  Even if you're light sparring, you're getting popped. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7186.580000000001s)]
*  You're getting jabbed. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7189.22s)]
*  Every now and then someone hits you [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7190.34s)]
*  with something a little stiff. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7191.34s)]
*  You see stars. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7192.860000000001s)]
*  It happens. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7194.56s)]
*  It always happens. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7195.68s)]
*  I can't remember a time, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7196.9400000000005s)]
*  you have to have really good training partners [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7199.54s)]
*  when it comes to striking, [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7202.34s)]
*  where you really trust them [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7203.860000000001s)]
*  that they're not gonna hit you hard. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7205.34s)]
*  And even then, sometimes accidentally they hit you hard. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7206.62s)]
*  You zig when you should have zagged, [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7209.700000000001s)]
*  you run into something, it just happens. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7211.22s)]
*  But with jiu-jitsu, you cut that down, way down. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7213.42s)]
*  The amount of head injuries and impacts and concussions [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7217.08s)]
*  in jiu-jitsu is tiny in comparison. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7220.1s)]
*  Every now and then you accidentally collide heads [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7222.6s)]
*  or you accidentally catch a knee to the head [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7224.820000000001s)]
*  and get knocked silly. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7226.46s)]
*  That does happen. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7227.700000000001s)]
*  But for the most part, it's the safest way [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7229.62s)]
*  to engage in combat sports. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7231.5s)]
*  And also it's one of the rare ones [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7233.219999999999s)]
*  where you could do it with a buddy [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7235.379999999999s)]
*  and you could both go full blast. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7236.62s)]
*  And you don't have to worry about killing each other. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7238.46s)]
*  Because if you're going full blast in gym kickboxing, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7240.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, you're gonna fucking break your brain 100%. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7242.58s)]
*  And I know a lot of guys have done it, [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7246.2s)]
*  and I used to do it. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7247.66s)]
*  We used to go to war. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7249.099999999999s)]
*  We didn't spar. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7250.7s)]
*  We beat the fuck out of each other. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7251.679999999999s)]
*  We hit each other full blast all the time. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7253.139999999999s)]
*  And it was all just about having good defense [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7255.66s)]
*  and being able to move around away from shots. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7257.62s)]
*  But you know the real shots were coming your way. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7259.7s)]
*  And you got dinged up a lot. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7261.46s)]
*  And if you're doing that forever, all throughout your years, [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7263.34s)]
*  Jerry Quarry is a good example. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7267.0599999999995s)]
*  Jerry Quarry was a boxer who fought Muhammad Ali [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7268.58s)]
*  on his return when he took those three years off. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7271.3s)]
*  And Jerry Quarry was notoriously tough, just tough. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7273.66s)]
*  Just would eat fucking punches. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7277.26s)]
*  Well, his brother was like him too. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7278.86s)]
*  And I think his brother only had one professional fight. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7280.3s)]
*  They were just always sparring in the gym. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7284.58s)]
*  His brother wound up with brain damage [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7287.9800000000005s)]
*  just as bad as Jerry. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7290.06s)]
*  Horrific brain damage, just from the gym. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7291.66s)]
*  The gym fucking counts, kids. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7294.8s)]
*  If you're listening out there and you're sparring [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7297.06s)]
*  and you're fucking tuning up on your friends [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7299.3s)]
*  and you guys are beating the shit out of each other, [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7301.62s)]
*  that counts for the rest of your life, [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7303.26s)]
*  whether your coach is telling you that or not. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7305.96s)]
*  Those sparring sessions, if you're going in there [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7308.5s)]
*  and you're getting dropped and you're getting rocked [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7310.5s)]
*  and you're rocking people and dropping people, [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7312.34s)]
*  you guys are giving each other brain damage. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7314.14s)]
*  100%. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7318.06s)]
*  And I was just having a conversation with a friend of mine [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7318.900000000001s)]
*  who was a professional fighter, [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7322.26s)]
*  who is now dealing with one of his friends who's suicidal, [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7324.860000000001s)]
*  who used to be a professional fighter. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7328.3s)]
*  And they were talking about the sparring sessions [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7329.780000000001s)]
*  that they had. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7331.780000000001s)]
*  They were talking about, [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7332.66s)]
*  geez, maybe we shouldn't have been beating the fuck [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7333.5s)]
*  out of each other all those years. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7335.1s)]
*  Because they would go to war. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7336.740000000001s)]
*  And in the early days of MMA in particular, [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7338.22s)]
*  now they're a little bit more sophisticated about it [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7340.46s)]
*  and they're much more aware of preserving yourself. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7342.7s)]
*  There's certain guys like Max Holloway, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7346.94s)]
*  he doesn't even spar. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7348.7s)]
*  He just fights. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7350.099999999999s)]
*  He says, I know how to fight. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7351.219999999999s)]
*  I don't wanna get beat up in the gym [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7353.0599999999995s)]
*  and go into a fight compromised. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7354.58s)]
*  He goes, I wanna go into a fight 100%. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7356.0199999999995s)]
*  So I don't even spar. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7357.94s)]
*  He just does drills. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7359.0599999999995s)]
*  And he's one of the best a lot. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7360.3s)]
*  But then there's guys like Sean Strickland [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7362.0s)]
*  that spar constantly. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7363.78s)]
*  Just his housecar broken into? [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7365.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7366.98s)]
*  Pull that video up. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7367.82s)]
*  What a wrong house to break into. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7369.179999999999s)]
*  Out of all the houses. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7372.42s)]
*  Out of all the houses to fuck with. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7373.7s)]
*  That guy, UFC middleweight champion who is a gun nut. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7375.98s)]
*  And really knows how to use guns. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7380.339999999999s)]
*  Out of all the guys. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7382.78s)]
*  Yeah, trains. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7383.7s)]
*  Every photo that he has, he does YouTube videos, [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7384.94s)]
*  just fucking ARs on the wall behind him. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7387.58s)]
*  He's not fucking around kids. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7390.099999999999s)]
*  He's ready. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7392.379999999999s)]
*  He's hilarious. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7393.219999999999s)]
*  That guy is hilarious. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7394.0599999999995s)]
*  He's very funny. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7395.74s)]
*  He's so marketable as an anti-hero. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7396.7s)]
*  But also a hero. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7400.0599999999995s)]
*  He's a guy. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7401.94s)]
*  Go to the volume. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7403.94s)]
*  Give me some volume. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7405.42s)]
*  So this is drunk guy. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7408.34s)]
*  And he's outside Sean's apartment. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7410.0s)]
*  Sean sees him. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7412.34s)]
*  It's a music play. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7415.38s)]
*  So he throws the guy down to the ground, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7424.62s)]
*  points a gun at him. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7425.9400000000005s)]
*  And he's standing on him. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7428.34s)]
*  I don't know what the guy was doing. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7431.66s)]
*  It seems like the guy was just obliterated drunk. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7433.1s)]
*  And he thought the guy was trying to rob him. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7436.620000000001s)]
*  But I think the guy was just shit faced [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7438.860000000001s)]
*  and he was looking for his keys or something. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7441.620000000001s)]
*  What was he doing? [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7444.900000000001s)]
*  Says he was arrested. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7446.1s)]
*  Oh, he hit a curb. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7447.54s)]
*  Okay, so he was driving drunk. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7448.42s)]
*  He stomped out a girl. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7452.22s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7454.14s)]
*  Oh, a security guard saw him stomp out a girl. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7455.660000000001s)]
*  He jumped into his car and drove off. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7457.820000000001s)]
*  Security followed him. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7460.3s)]
*  He hit a curb, completely shredded his tire, [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7461.34s)]
*  drove in the room for a while, [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7464.06s)]
*  then jumped down and tried to hide [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7465.34s)]
*  at Sean Strickland's house. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7466.7s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7467.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, whoops. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7469.38s)]
*  Wrong dude. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7471.54s)]
*  Wrong dude. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7472.38s)]
*  That's karma. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7473.22s)]
*  That is the universe sending you to the wrong spot. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7474.06s)]
*  That's the gravitational pull to Sean's house was strong. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7476.5s)]
*  He was such a cunt that the universe guided him [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7482.54s)]
*  to the absolute worst place he could ever be [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7484.74s)]
*  while he just did those things. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7487.26s)]
*  Stomped out a girl, drove drunk, [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7488.9800000000005s)]
*  smashed his car into a curb, [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7490.62s)]
*  ditched it, tried to hide at the absolute wrong spot. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7492.22s)]
*  That guy's social media has gotta be [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7498.62s)]
*  some of the most entertaining social media. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7501.22s)]
*  Oh, he's hilarious. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7503.3s)]
*  And he's a champion. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7504.3s)]
*  So it's like he's behaving like a wild young contender, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7506.3s)]
*  but he's the number one guy on earth. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7510.9s)]
*  I mean, listen, it's hard to say. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7514.58s)]
*  People can say what they want about that Adesanya fight. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7516.46s)]
*  Oh, Izzy wasn't himself. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7518.86s)]
*  Dude, he wasn't himself because he got clipped [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7521.22s)]
*  with a bomb of a right hand by Strickland [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7522.46s)]
*  in that first round. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7524.82s)]
*  Strickland connected with a picture perfect right hand, [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7525.900000000001s)]
*  rocked Izzy, and then hit him with, [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7528.900000000001s)]
*  how many shots did he hit him with afterwards? [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7531.54s)]
*  Eight, 10 clean shots to the head, left hooks, [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7533.42s)]
*  in the clinch? [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7537.42s)]
*  I mean, of course he wasn't himself after that. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7538.9400000000005s)]
*  When you get hit like that in a fight, [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7541.46s)]
*  you're a fucksville for the rest of those, [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7543.62s)]
*  I mean, he probably doesn't remember those rounds. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7545.78s)]
*  He fought five rounds compromised. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7547.62s)]
*  Who knows how dinged up he got? [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7549.62s)]
*  Only he knows, only Izzy knows how bad he got hurt [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7551.22s)]
*  in that first round. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7554.3s)]
*  But when you get rocked that way and your legs give out [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7555.12s)]
*  and you go down like Izzy did, that's a concussion, kids. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7558.22s)]
*  You got rocked. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7562.7s)]
*  That's a real getting rocked. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7564.0599999999995s)]
*  That guy did that. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7566.3s)]
*  So you can talk all the shit you want, [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7567.5s)]
*  because Strickland seems like he's got this awkward style [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7569.74s)]
*  and people think he's not as good as he is, [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7572.94s)]
*  but you watch him tune dudes up, [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7574.92s)]
*  and you're like, that guy's a motherfucker, man. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7576.66s)]
*  He spars more than anybody in the UFC, [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7580.9s)]
*  and they put a mouthpiece that measures [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7582.74s)]
*  how many times you get hit. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7584.7s)]
*  He gets hit less than anyone. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7585.78s)]
*  Seriously? [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7588.62s)]
*  He's got phenomenal defense, man. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7589.46s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7590.5s)]
*  Phenomenal defense. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7591.34s)]
*  His distance management is off the charts, [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7593.18s)]
*  and it's because he's constantly sparring. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7595.5s)]
*  So that's what he does better than anybody. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7598.14s)]
*  He fights. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7600.34s)]
*  And when he spars, have you seen the videos of him sparring? [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7601.3s)]
*  He's fucking fighting. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7603.94s)]
*  You're fighting him. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7605.22s)]
*  Like boxers coming in to talk shit, [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7606.54s)]
*  he beats the fuck out of them with just boxing. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7608.34s)]
*  He's fucking dangerous, man. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7611.54s)]
*  So the universe led that guy to that man's house. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7613.5s)]
*  That's like perfect karmic justice. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7618.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's beautiful. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7621.3s)]
*  For a guy who stomps out a girl and then drives drunk [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7622.700000000001s)]
*  and shreds his car and tries to run, [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7625.14s)]
*  that is an absolute perfect way. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7626.26s)]
*  And then it's all on camera. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7628.3s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7629.38s)]
*  It's the universe. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7630.660000000001s)]
*  Sometimes it delivers. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7632.18s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes there's an opening [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7633.26s)]
*  and that fucking wounded gazelle. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7635.22s)]
*  Wanders into Sean Strickland's house. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7638.5s)]
*  You fucking victim. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7642.5s)]
*  That cunt of a gazelle. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7645.58s)]
*  Every now and then. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7648.46s)]
*  Yeah, every now and then the universe [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7649.5s)]
*  will give us one of those. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7650.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and thank God. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7652.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7653.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's good. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7654.7s)]
*  It's good that this, [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7656.06s)]
*  but again, that's the right to keep him bare arms. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7656.900000000001s)]
*  That's freedom. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7659.860000000001s)]
*  That's like the ability to protect yourself. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7661.02s)]
*  He didn't know who the fuck that guy was. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7662.5s)]
*  What if that guy was a creep? [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7664.1s)]
*  Yeah, who knows? [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7665.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, I got another one. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7666.780000000001s)]
*  I got one for you. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7667.620000000001s)]

*  What? [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7670.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I sent this to my friend, Sean, [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7671.820000000001s)]
*  my friend Justin rather. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7674.42s)]

*  Not in mine. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7841.18s)]
*  They were saying if we should do it. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7842.02s)]
*  And I was like, or let people. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7844.3s)]
*  And I was like, hey man, your title and your name, [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7846.26s)]
*  that's all we need to do here. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7849.66s)]

*  We don't need to do this. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7852.42s)]
*  I'm not participating in this like horse shit, [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7853.46s)]
*  whatever this is. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7856.54s)]
*  I saw a comedian that had that in their bio. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7857.38s)]
*  Are they funny? [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7859.860000000001s)]
*  I find that hard to believe that there's too many. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7861.06s)]
*  It's not possible. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7862.900000000001s)]
*  They can't be. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7863.74s)]
*  Culturally, they don't, like there's a section [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7864.62s)]
*  of the population that tends to be like really liberal, [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7867.38s)]
*  like the woke side of the spectrum. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7871.06s)]
*  They're not funny. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7872.9400000000005s)]
*  They can't have humor. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7874.02s)]
*  They're humorless. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7875.54s)]
*  They could. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7876.38s)]
*  It's part of this. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7877.22s)]
*  They could 10 years ago. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7878.06s)]
*  10, 15 years ago, you could. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7879.900000000001s)]
*  Because there's a lot of people that you would consider woke [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7881.66s)]
*  that were very liberal, [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7884.38s)]
*  but they were able to use humor in a way [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7885.82s)]
*  that is very offensive if it was not humor. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7889.82s)]
*  Because it's, but it's humor. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7894.82s)]
*  It's only supposed to be funny. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7896.3s)]
*  It's not like they're making statements. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7897.66s)]
*  Like these are affidavits. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7899.3s)]
*  These are my real beliefs on things. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7900.7s)]
*  No, they're saying things in a way that's either ironic [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7902.06s)]
*  or sarcastic or it's a parody or whatever, [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7904.9800000000005s)]
*  but it's very funny. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7906.9800000000005s)]
*  And it's very funny and uses outrageous language [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7908.62s)]
*  and uses what people would think is problematic stereotypes [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7911.860000000001s)]
*  and all kinds of shit like that. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7915.78s)]
*  And there was a lot of liberal comedians [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7917.06s)]
*  that would walk that line and be really good at it. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7919.3s)]
*  You know, they would say something racist [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7922.14s)]
*  from the perspective of a racist person [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7924.38s)]
*  and make fun of that person, [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7927.860000000001s)]
*  but also make fun of the way that person's talking [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7929.58s)]
*  about things and the way that person's talking [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7931.58s)]
*  about things are also funny. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7933.42s)]
*  And you could do that. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7935.38s)]
*  Now you can't do that anymore. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7936.62s)]
*  Because now those people are so, [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=7938.06s)]

*  Very left-wing guy. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8049.0s)]
*  You used to be able to do that. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8050.12s)]
*  You used to be able to do that with humor. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8051.88s)]
*  There's a lot of comics that are really liberal [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8053.599999999999s)]

*  the undercurrent, the tide. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8075.04s)]
*  They're getting pulled by a riptide [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8077.72s)]
*  of this culture run amok. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8079.64s)]
*  And they don't do anything to stop it. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8082.16s)]
*  And that's why guys like Bill Maher are interesting. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8084.96s)]
*  Because he does. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8088.32s)]

*  And that's against what most of that ideology [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8117.400000000001s)]
*  wants you to say. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8120.88s)]

*  So if you're, if you don't agree, [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8126.72s)]
*  if you don't pass the purity test, [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8129.72s)]

*  You're a Nazi. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8134.12s)]

*  you're labeled as something that you're not, obviously, [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8138.2s)]
*  just because you want to have a different opinion. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8141.0s)]

*  philosophical conversations that don't make sense. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8155.72s)]
*  I think part of it is, like, I truly do believe [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8158.28s)]
*  that there's part of this that's directly contributed to [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8161.719999999999s)]
*  from our strategic enemies. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8165.8s)]
*  I think that we're in the middle [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8167.84s)]
*  of this information operation, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8169.5199999999995s)]
*  and I think people wittingly and unwittingly [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8171.719999999999s)]
*  are participating in this crazy, chaotic narrative, [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8174.4s)]
*  and they're saying, but this is what we need to do. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8178.36s)]
*  Actually, what you're doing is you're just [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8180.5599999999995s)]
*  directly relaying propaganda. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8182.84s)]
*  That's what you're doing, [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8185.5599999999995s)]
*  and you're trying to cause cultural divides, [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8186.4s)]
*  they're trying to divide us, they're trying to make us argue, [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8189.12s)]
*  because they're the ones that directly reap the benefits [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8190.8s)]
*  of all this chaos. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8193.76s)]
*  Who else would reap the benefits of this? [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8194.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's laid out by Yuri Besmanov in the 1980s, [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8197.0s)]
*  and people who haven't seen that, go watch this video, [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8202.48s)]
*  it's on YouTube, former KGB defector Yuri Besmanov, [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8205.8s)]
*  he outlines how Russia has invaded our education system [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8211.48s)]
*  and what they're doing to try to destroy our culture. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8217.48s)]
*  And whether or not you believe in that shit or not, [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8220.4s)]
*  just listen to what he's saying and see what's happened. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8223.24s)]
*  He is outlining exactly how it would take place. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8226.0s)]
*  He's off by about 10 years, but he outlined it [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8229.72s)]
*  in terms of how many generations it would take [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8232.76s)]
*  for a complete moral decay and a complete, [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8234.8s)]
*  an erosion of our faith in the democratic process, [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8240.279999999999s)]
*  and all of it's laid out. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8243.279999999999s)]
*  All that's laid out exactly what you see. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8244.88s)]
*  And that's the enemy of comedy. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8247.92s)]
*  Like, you're gonna fucking fall in on that. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8251.039999999999s)]
*  Like, you can't be funny. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8253.88s)]
*  And you can't be funny and be involved [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8256.359999999999s)]
*  in this fucking chaotic war. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8259.439999999999s)]
*  I was watching a Jiu Jitsu coach online. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8261.279999999999s)]
*  They were talking about whether or not [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8266.08s)]
*  he supports trans women competing in women's division. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8268.359999999999s)]
*  And he was saying, of course I do, because I'm not a Nazi. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8273.400000000001s)]
*  We're not Nazis. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8278.12s)]
*  So if you don't support biological males [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8279.68s)]
*  competing against women in Jiu Jitsu matches, you're a Nazi. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8283.44s)]
*  I was like, this is crazy. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8288.560000000001s)]
*  This kind of nutty shit has made it all the way to Jiu Jitsu. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8290.84s)]
*  Do you think that eventually it loses [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8295.0s)]
*  the effectiveness of the term if they're just overusing, [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8297.36s)]
*  fascist and Nazi in every sentence, [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8301.92s)]
*  do you think eventually it at least runs out of inertia [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8303.960000000001s)]
*  because they've used it so much [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8306.36s)]
*  that it loses its effectiveness? [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8307.92s)]
*  It definitely does, but the problem with that [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8309.48s)]
*  is there's real Nazis out there. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8311.36s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8312.76s)]
*  That's the problem with crying wolf, right? [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8313.6s)]
*  Like, one day you're gonna see a real wolf. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8315.32s)]

*  who objects to that a Nazi, [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8340.76s)]
*  because there are Nazis. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8343.320000000002s)]

*  Like, what are we doing? [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8683.599999999999s)]
*  Like, what are we doing? [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8684.759999999998s)]
*  We gave perverts like a complete Willy Wonka golden ticket, [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8685.599999999999s)]
*  a hall pass. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8690.279999999999s)]

*  the conversation in the country around what, [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8697.0s)]
*  quite literally small meaningless things versus saying, [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8700.56s)]
*  these are big strategic threats to our way of life. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8704.4s)]

*  outside of this country every day [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8709.32s)]

*  of the last several hundred years. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8716.72s)]
*  I mean, I don't even necessarily say that I believe in this [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8719.72s)]
*  and it's not a feeling. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8723.8s)]
*  It is what it is in the context of spending most [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8724.72s)]

*  that we're trapped in arguing about all [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8739.88s)]
*  of these different things because at that point [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8742.64s)]
*  we're taking our eye off the ball. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8744.8s)]

*  in this like, you know, endless cycle of wars of occupation [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8748.359999999999s)]
*  where we spent trillions of dollars. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8752.88s)]

*  You know why? [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8755.439999999999s)]

*  in some of these regions. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8759.24s)]
*  And then, you know, China can snap up ports [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8760.279999999999s)]
*  and economic influence [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8763.359999999999s)]
*  and they can start building their power. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8765.0s)]
*  And we, as a country, if we don't like focus [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8767.88s)]

*  on what is culturally important to us, [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8774.4s)]

*  Freedom of speech. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8778.679999999998s)]
*  Good for instance in this is, [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8779.72s)]
*  we were talking about it in California, [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8781.92s)]
*  like comedy is one of the last places [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8783.92s)]
*  where you should be able to say what it is [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8787.279999999999s)]
*  that you wanna say. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8790.199999999999s)]
*  Like, and I'm saying everywhere we should be able [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8791.599999999999s)]
*  to do this and we should absolutely protect it. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8793.92s)]
*  But if comedy is under attack [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8796.2s)]
*  from people wanting to cancel comedy because of jokes, [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8798.560000000001s)]
*  that's a problem as a country, as a society. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8803.400000000001s)]
*  That's a fucking huge problem. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8806.480000000001s)]
*  Well, the Lakota had a term called the Hayoka, [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8807.960000000001s)]
*  the sacred clown. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8812.240000000002s)]
*  They had a person in their society [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8813.400000000001s)]
*  that made fun of everything [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8815.76s)]

*  Like, how do I know if this thing is legit? [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8821.08s)]
*  If someone can't make fun of it, [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8823.880000000001s)]
*  that's probably a thing that there's a problem [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8826.84s)]
*  with that thing. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8828.32s)]
*  If you can't discuss it and you can't mock it, [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8829.24s)]
*  there's probably a problem with that thing. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8831.88s)]
*  Like maybe that thing is like, [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8834.24s)]
*  maybe there's a little bit of a culty aspect to that thing. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8835.8s)]
*  And here's a question. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8839.48s)]
*  Do you think we're doing the same thing overseas? [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8842.2s)]
*  Are we doing the same sort of social media campaigns? [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8844.52s)]
*  We must be. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8849.76s)]
*  I asked Mike Baker and he fucking gave me the run around. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8850.6s)]
*  I think, here's my honesty. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8852.96s)]
*  Everybody that starts a conversation by saying, [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8856.919999999998s)]
*  here's my honest opinion. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8859.679999999998s)]
*  But my assessment in this is I think that [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8862.119999999999s)]
*  we have forfeited portions of foreign service [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8864.679999999998s)]
*  to the left in the context of wokeism, politically correct. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8872.279999999999s)]
*  The act of maintaining your sovereignty [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8879.039999999999s)]
*  in the context of military and then economically [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8881.52s)]
*  is not politically correct. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8886.08s)]
*  You can't broker in that rhetoric [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8887.560000000001s)]
*  and then implement a strategic long-term goals [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8892.32s)]
*  and objectives that are going to meet and exceed [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8895.68s)]
*  what we have to do to maintain America. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8898.16s)]
*  And ultimately, America's power overseas [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8900.92s)]
*  if you believe in it. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8904.24s)]
*  You just can't because it's not politically correct. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8905.16s)]
*  If you believe that all nations are created [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8908.68s)]
*  and all political ideologies are equal, [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8911.64s)]

*  It's not. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8915.519999999999s)]
*  I tend to not tend. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8918.519999999999s)]
*  I think communism is a dogshit ideology. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8920.32s)]
*  I think that it should have been flushed down [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8924.759999999998s)]

*  You can't dabble in it. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8934.08s)]
*  It's so dangerous to start dabbling in these things [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8936.08s)]
*  because it's a failed ideology. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8939.32s)]
*  You have to flush it down the toilet. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8942.96s)]
*  It has to go away forever. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8944.64s)]
*  And then you have to evolve past that at a certain point. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8946.6s)]
*  But when you've co-opted our academic institutions [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8949.64s)]
*  and you've indoctrinated generations [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=8953.4s)]

*  Not much has changed. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9405.84s)]
*  If you think, [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9407.04s)]
*  2,500 years ago, we'll say, [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9411.68s)]
*  Socrates was put to death for corrupting the youth, [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9414.2s)]
*  I think is what it was. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9420.92s)]
*  And I'm trying to recall it. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9421.84s)]
*  But he was out there on the street arguing [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9423.48s)]
*  and debating with people, talking about ideas. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9426.52s)]
*  And the Athenians were like, [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9428.84s)]
*  we gotta get rid of this guy. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9431.08s)]
*  He's pressure testing what we're doing. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9433.24s)]
*  We gotta put this dude down. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9436.08s)]
*  And I think, well, that was 2,500 years ago. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9437.84s)]
*  So anytime the state deems information as a threat, [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9441.0s)]
*  we should probably be looking at that information [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9445.560000000001s)]
*  and then really trying to have an open discussion about it. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9448.6s)]
*  That's the beauty of America, freedom of speech. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9451.800000000001s)]
*  Yes, it is the beauty of America. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9454.560000000001s)]
*  But it's also why they're trying to crack down [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9456.640000000001s)]
*  on the internet. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9458.12s)]
*  The internet has been the biggest force [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9459.0s)]
*  in not just relaying this propaganda, [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9461.28s)]
*  but also fighting against propaganda [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9463.6s)]
*  and letting people realize, [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9465.92s)]
*  hey, these people that are supposed to be your leaders, [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9467.480000000001s)]
*  they're compromised and they're fucking you. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9471.12s)]
*  And there's some things that they're doing now [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9473.720000000001s)]
*  that they're just doing. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9475.52s)]
*  And what is the economic consequence [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9476.52s)]
*  of the hundreds of billions of dollars [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9480.68s)]
*  that are being spent on these wars [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9482.400000000001s)]
*  that we're not interested in? [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9484.28s)]
*  What are the economic consequences? [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9487.12s)]
*  Where are the actual legal consequences for, [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9489.04s)]
*  I mean, here's an easy one, [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9495.0s)]
*  which is we invaded a country of Iraq [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9496.24s)]
*  because of weapons of mass destruction [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9498.48s)]
*  and there's so-called, that didn't exist. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9500.24s)]
*  Not one person went to jail. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9502.32s)]
*  We spent more time trying to connect this fiction [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9503.96s)]
*  around Russian collusion for two years [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9507.64s)]
*  than we did investigating [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9510.24s)]
*  why there was a massive information operation internally [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9511.92s)]
*  to the United States that said [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9515.6s)]
*  there was weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9516.92s)]
*  Not one person went to jail. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9519.0s)]
*  Not one person stepped in front of Congress [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9520.4s)]
*  and had depositions around, [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9522.8s)]
*  why did you say that there was weapons of mass destruction [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9526.84s)]
*  when there wasn't? [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9529.2s)]
*  Not one person. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9530.12s)]
*  But we spent how many trillions of dollars on this war? [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9530.960000000001s)]
*  And how many people died? [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9534.04s)]
*  Yeah, how many? [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9535.12s)]
*  How many innocent Iraqis died? [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9535.960000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, these are hundreds of thousands of people. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9537.52s)]
*  I mean, my peer group alone, [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9539.76s)]
*  just thousands of people that are physically [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9541.36s)]
*  and mentally altered forever, [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9543.32s)]
*  that spent, you could say, the best years of our life [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9544.8s)]
*  in a war under false pretenses. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9550.439999999999s)]
*  And now the long-term effects are coming back [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9553.599999999999s)]
*  and also the government doesn't want to pay [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9557.56s)]
*  for that bill as well. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9559.16s)]
*  Yeah, they were trying to deny Gulf War Syndrome. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9560.56s)]
*  Remember that? [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9564.64s)]
*  When they were using depleted uranium rounds. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9565.48s)]
*  So these people were all getting radiation poisoning [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9567.92s)]
*  and their children were born deformed [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9571.279999999999s)]
*  and they were having these massive problems [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9574.0s)]
*  and they were trying to deny it [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9576.199999999999s)]
*  because they didn't want to pay for it. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9577.599999999999s)]
*  They don't want to pay for it. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9578.839999999998s)]
*  They don't want to write the check. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9579.88s)]
*  They do when it directly benefits [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9581.599999999999s)]
*  what I would say is the military industrial complex [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9585.16s)]
*  and these wars of occupation. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9587.279999999999s)]
*  I don't want to make it sound like I'm anti. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9588.519999999999s)]
*  I think there's a difference between a war of necessity [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9590.919999999998s)]
*  that maintains national sovereignty [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9595.32s)]
*  and a long-term war of choice for occupation. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9597.16s)]
*  That's a war of choice in occupation [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9600.8s)]
*  is an exercise in transference of wealth [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9603.8s)]
*  from the taxpayer into the military industrial complex. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9606.359999999999s)]
*  And that's like firsthand experience [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9608.8s)]
*  spending 2003 to 2009 in Iraq. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9611.199999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's a lot of time. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9616.4s)]
*  Four and a half years on the ground [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9618.519999999999s)]
*  and then another three years in Afghanistan. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9620.039999999999s)]
*  Just seeing the expense from blood and treasure alone [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9623.64s)]
*  over the course of 10 years of deployments [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9628.2s)]
*  and understanding what the difference is [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9632.36s)]
*  between precision tracking and then killing terrorists [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9634.12s)]
*  and what we needed to do in order to stabilize a region [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9640.400000000001s)]
*  and then long-term massive wars of occupation. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9643.12s)]
*  There's a very distinct difference. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9646.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's very important to bring up. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9649.04s)]
*  And it's also very important to bring up that [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9651.820000000002s)]
*  you have to have military power [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9655.119999999999s)]
*  because other countries have it. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9659.68s)]
*  And people who don't think [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9661.76s)]
*  that you should support the military, [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9663.42s)]
*  there's people that think all military is evil. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9664.88s)]
*  Listen, if we didn't have it, what do you think would happen? [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9667.74s)]
*  What do you think would happen? [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9672.16s)]
*  Like, do you think the whole world [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9674.279999999999s)]
*  would lay down their arms if we did? [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9676.0s)]
*  Do you think that's what would happen? [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9677.88s)]
*  We have to live in reality. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9679.48s)]
*  And the reality of this world, [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9681.24s)]
*  and you know it better than anybody, [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9682.6s)]
*  this world is a fucking messy place. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9684.720000000001s)]
*  We live in a bubble here, [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9688.44s)]
*  a very protected artificial reality. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9692.400000000001s)]
*  When you get out into the most dangerous places [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9695.980000000001s)]
*  in the world, that's where you see nature. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9699.12s)]
*  That's where you see the real rules of life, [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9703.6s)]
*  which is the only rules are those of physics. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9706.84s)]
*  Bullets travel at X feet per second. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9712.48s)]
*  You have a collective team trying to organize [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9716.28s)]
*  in a very chaotic environment, trying to survive. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9720.16s)]
*  But really, you strip every piece of what you know [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9725.04s)]
*  around rules, around what's right and wrong. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9730.2s)]
*  Your morality is put into question. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9734.08s)]
*  Your mortality is at stake all the time. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9736.16s)]
*  And you see the real world. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9739.6s)]
*  It's eye-opening to the point of you understand [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9744.92s)]
*  how great we have it in the United States [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9750.640000000001s)]
*  and how beautiful this country is. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9753.0s)]
*  And you also understand how fragile life is [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9755.56s)]
*  and how brutal the world can be [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9758.92s)]
*  and how brutal humanity can be towards each other. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9763.2s)]
*  You know it can be gone, like that. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9765.68s)]
*  And I think being exposed to it for that long [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9770.24s)]
*  and then coming home, the things that I've been able [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9773.6s)]
*  to pull away from that are, this place is amazing. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9778.279999999999s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9780.96s)]
*  It's something that we should foster and encourage [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9782.039999999999s)]
*  and continue to pass down through generations [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9786.24s)]
*  because we're so fucking fortunate [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9788.8s)]
*  to have hit the birth lottery being born here. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9791.16s)]

*  And I'm so happy for the experiences of war [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9804.76s)]
*  because it's shown me what it's like [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9808.359999999999s)]
*  to understand my mortality, sometimes second to second, [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9814.199999999999s)]
*  but for sure day to day for years on end [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9819.96s)]
*  and understand that we're only here [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9823.32s)]
*  for a short amount of time [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9824.92s)]
*  and we gotta make it fucking count. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9826.560000000001s)]
*  And we also have to be very grateful and gracious [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9828.800000000001s)]
*  to what we have here for our freedoms [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9831.960000000001s)]
*  and our country and our countrymen. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9834.44s)]
*  And the experience of war itself, [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9837.08s)]
*  that chaotic environment that's shown me traffic rules [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9840.84s)]
*  don't apply over there, right? [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9846.2s)]
*  It's like traffic lights and police officers [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9847.720000000001s)]
*  and the things that we take for granted every day, [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9849.880000000001s)]
*  going to work, making our coffee, [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9853.4s)]
*  doing all the things that we do, [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9855.84s)]
*  you strip all that away into just the law of nature. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9857.44s)]
*  It is wild. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9863.36s)]
*  Like it is forever life-changing, [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9864.68s)]
*  but you also understand this is what we're living in. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9867.44s)]
*  Like this is the actual consequence of what we're living in. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9871.24s)]
*  We're very protected in the way that we live life right now. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9874.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'm real glad you said that. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9877.960000000001s)]
*  I'm real glad you relayed that message that way. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9880.12s)]
*  People need to hear it. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9882.44s)]
*  Let's wrap this bitch up. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9884.64s)]
*  Sweet. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9886.119999999999s)]
*  Appreciate you brother. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9886.96s)]
*  Thanks man. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9887.8s)]
*  Always a good time. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9888.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah dude. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9889.46s)]
*  Evan Hayford ladies and gentlemen. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9890.279999999999s)]
*  Bye everybody. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdgDQJZlrI&t=9891.119999999999s)]
