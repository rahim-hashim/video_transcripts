# Joe Rogan Experience #2213 - Diane K. Boyd
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FYv4yjOi2Q)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  What's up?
*  How are you?
*  I am great.
*  Long flight in from Montana, but I'm great.
*  Thank you.
*  Well, it's very nice to meet you.
*  And I really enjoyed you on Steve Rinell's podcast as well.
*  Oh, good.
*  You got to watch it.
*  Yeah.
*  Steve made the introduction.
*  Yes.
*  He told me I have to have you on because he knows how fascinated I am by wolves.
*  So I'm really excited to talk to you.
*  Thanks.
*  And I'm excited too because I thought, well, we're both hunters.
*  We're both dog lovers.
*  You got an interest in wolves.
*  It's all good.
*  How did you start getting interested in wolves and start working with wolves?
*  Well, I grew up in Minnesota and probably tell from the Fargo accent.
*  But I grew up in Minnesota.
*  And back in the 60s and 70s when I was thinking about a career, Minnesota was the only state
*  in the lower 48 that had wolves with the exception of a few, like 25 maybe in Iowa
*  or a couple here or there in Wisconsin.
*  And so I was interested from the beginning with that.
*  And then when I went to the University of Minnesota, Dave Meach, who was like the god
*  of the wolf world, his office was on my campus.
*  So I just stopped by and kept bugging him.
*  I wouldn't go away like a good parasite.
*  Persist, persist, persist.
*  Why wolves?
*  Why were wolves so interesting to you?
*  You know, I'm just I'm kind of a wildlife person.
*  They're the ultimate in a really wild and smart animal.
*  They're carnivore.
*  They're social like people.
*  And I think I was denied having a dog most of my life growing up till I was about 15.
*  So I had this this passion for canines in general.
*  I love dogs.
*  I do, too.
*  I love them.
*  And I love wolves.
*  I'm so fascinated by them.
*  And I'm so interested in the whole history of them in this country, how they were sort
*  of eradicated from most of the Western states and the reintroduction of them.
*  So you were there for all of it, right?
*  So when you first started, they had pretty much been wiped out, except, as you said,
*  in Minnesota.
*  You said Idaho is that was the only other place that had them?
*  No, I'll Royal, which is an island in Lake Superior.
*  It's actually technically part of Michigan.
*  They walked over on the frozen Lake Superior ice in the late like nineteen forty nine fifties
*  early and they stayed and they they got seated there and they had endless amount of moose
*  to kill and eat.
*  So they were kind of a wolf paradise with that.
*  And is it still like that there?
*  Yes.
*  And the populations of wolves and moose go up and down because, you know, in nature,
*  nothing is here.
*  We always wanted to be here, but it's always doing this.
*  Right.
*  And yeah, they're doing there.
*  And then, interestingly, when they when they arrived, they migrated on their own power.
*  There was very little immigration.
*  There was a couple of wolves documented showing up here and there.
*  Apparently, genetically, there was no influx of new genes.
*  So the wolves that came and went didn't breed.
*  And eventually they became so inbred, they started having physical anomalies.
*  And eventually, just a few years ago, four or five years ago, they got down to just a
*  father, daughter team and only two wolves left.
*  And it was over.
*  And so they wouldn't breed because they have they don't breed close relatives generally.
*  So they just did a reintroduction to Iowa, too.
*  It's been relatively new, just a handful of years.
*  So they had to reboost the population if they wanted to keep going or wait for the lake
*  to freeze again, which may or may not happen in our lifetimes.
*  You know, hmm.
*  So when they reintroduce them, this is one of the sticking points about the reintroduction
*  Yellowstone.
*  A lot of people that were against it were saying that they reintroduced a different
*  size wolf, that they reintroduce wolves from Canada.
*  Yeah.
*  Sort of?
*  No.
*  So in my book, I've got a chapter called Slaying the Super Wolf.
*  And so people call these wolves super wolves because they say that they're they're not
*  native, they're Canadian super wolves and they weigh 170 pounds and goes on and on and
*  on.
*  But I documented a wolf that I caught in the Glacier Park area, wolf 8551.
*  And we just had VHF collars.
*  We didn't have satellite collars in those days.
*  She hung around for a while and then she just disappeared.
*  And seven months later, the British Columbia Environmental Ministry Game Warden called me,
*  says, we got we got one of your wolves killed.
*  Do you want to call her?
*  Yes, please.
*  Where is it?
*  Puskupe?
*  I said, oh, where is that?
*  Well, it turns out that is 540 miles north of Glacier Park in seven months.
*  So we didn't know if the guy, a farmer shot it in July.
*  If they hadn't shot it, we would never have known what happened to her.
*  But if she would have gone south instead of north, she'd have been about 100 miles south
*  of Yellowstone Park.
*  So clearly they have the ability to disperse that far.
*  The other interesting thing about that wolf is when she went north, they got the reintroduced
*  wolves from two areas from Hinton in Alberta and Fort St. John's in British Columbia.
*  And she dispersed past the Hinton population and ended up almost at where the Fort St.
*  John's wolves were.
*  So this little wolf, 80-pound wolf, showed us that it's one continuous population from
*  Yellowstone almost to the Yukon.
*  It's connected because it's a walkabout for a wolf.
*  It's not a big deal.
*  We just didn't back to back then.
*  We didn't have the tools to document kind of those long dispersals.
*  I just read this week that a wolf that showed up in Colorado that was shot this year, they
*  just did the DNA on it apparently pretty recently.
*  And it was from the Midwest.
*  Think about that, to Colorado.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  So Midwest like Wisconsin?
*  Yeah.
*  Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan.
*  It just said the Great Lakes region.
*  It didn't just identify because they're all kind of the same.
*  But it was not a Western wolf.
*  It was not from Wyoming or Montana.
*  Really interesting.
*  Any speculation as to why she went so far north?
*  No.
*  She was originally from a northern population.
*  The wolf that I'm talking about, 504.
*  Yeah, she was born in Glacier Park.
*  We caught her first as a pup, so we know where she was born.
*  We know the den.
*  And then at about a year and a half of age, almost two, she dispersed that far.
*  And she didn't have to go that far.
*  I mean, if she wanted to find other wolves and start a pack or join a pack, she could
*  have gone any direction, 50 or 100 miles and found other wolves.
*  You know what?
*  You tell me why wolves do what they do and I'll buy a lottery ticket.
*  I mean, I don't know how these things work.
*  I just don't know.
*  So is that common that they would travel that far?
*  It's becoming more and more common.
*  So now that we have satellite collars, we've been using those for years, we can track them
*  without having to stay in touch physically with them.
*  In the old days, we just had VHF collars and you had to physically be there within range,
*  like from an airplane or track them.
*  But now that we got satellite collars, I mean, my gosh, we've got wolves going from Washington
*  to Montana.
*  And one of the wolves from Wyoming went all the way down to Arizona to just north of the
*  Grand Canyon with the satellite collar was tracked.
*  And then it turned around and started home and it got shot in Utah.
*  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
*  It's a really healthy, good thing to talk about what you're going through with people,
*  the good and the bad.
*  Don't keep it all bottled up.
*  And sometimes that can be friends or family, but it also helps to talk to pros.
*  And that's where BetterHelp comes in.

*  So when they're doing this and you track them, how long do those collars batteries last?
*  Well, sadly for the VHF collars, the wolves generally die before the collars do because
*  wolves don't live very long.
*  An average VHF collar lasts about four years, an average satellite collar one to two years.
*  And I don't understand why the technology is not better to prolong some kind of a new
*  battery because once you put all the trauma of going through the wolf with a helicopter
*  and catching it or whatever, you'd think they could get some kind of a super battery that
*  would last a long time.
*  That would be too heavy.
*  Heavy, yeah.
*  And wolves are on average 100 pounds.
*  And the batteries are pretty big.
*  But I'm waiting for Elon Musk to develop a super radio collar battery.
*  Well they're pretty close to developing some pretty spectacular battery technology.
*  I just was reading about that.
*  Yeah, they're trying to implement it in automobiles.
*  They're going to be able to do it.
*  I believe Samsung is at the forefront of that.
*  Yeah, because obviously they make batteries for their phones and electronics and things
*  along those lines.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that a hydrogen battery or something crazy?
*  I do not know.
*  I was just reading.
*  I'm sorry, I don't remember.
*  Yeah.
*  So they're wearing this heavy collar and they're good for about two years.
*  And a wolf in the wild lives how long on average?
*  That's a ... I always when I do have a talk, I ask audience, how long do you think the
*  average wolf lives?
*  So if you guess from the time they're visible from the den emergence, like you start to
*  see them at four weeks.
*  And if you die before that, until they die.
*  Do you want to take a guess?
*  I would be cheating because I listened to the vanilla podcast.
*  I think it was 4.3 years.
*  4.3 years.
*  Yeah.
*  Dr. Randall got that.
*  I think it was it.
*  I was shocked.
*  I thought they would live older because an elk, like a bull elk, like if you shoot a
*  mature one, they're seven, eight years old.
*  I mean I shot one that was 11.
*  You did.
*  I bet the antlers were getting smaller by that time.
*  Yes.
*  And the teeth were worn down almost nothing.
*  They're not evolved to live that long.
*  They just aren't.
*  They die sooner because they burn up so much energy and years of mating and breeding that
*  they get worn down and then they die.
*  The wolves, I mean in a zoo or a captive situation, they can live to be 15.
*  Like a dog.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's extraordinary.
*  I think the longest I had a wolf, a wild wolf that I knew her age because I caught her as
*  a pup and we recaptured her and we tagged her, 12 years.
*  That's extremely long for an old wolf.
*  Wow.
*  12 years in the wild.
*  There's a few in Yellowstone that I got that old.
*  We had one of mine that dispersed to Idaho and he, kind of interesting, I caught him
*  in 1990 and he dispersed about a year later on his own, went to Idaho in the middle of
*  the Frank Church River of Nauvertown Wilderness.
*  There were no other wolves at that time and he just hung around.
*  We'd see him once in a while from the airplane.
*  By himself.
*  By himself.
*  He was a big male.
*  When I got him he was 111 pounds.
*  But this animal had to survive by killing animals alone.
*  That's crazy.
*  Trying to pull down an elk with your teeth.
*  Is it because the old males don't get accepted into a new pack?
*  He went to where there weren't any wolves, interestingly, but he had a success story
*  because he just waited it out and when they reintroduced those wolves into Idaho in 95
*  and 96, a little black female wolf pops out of her crate and just hits the road as fast
*  as she can go and she bumps into this wolf and they set up a territory in Kelly Creek
*  and they became a breeding mating pair for years and years until he died of old age.
*  Wow.
*  So he was just kind of chilling on his own for years.
*  How many years?
*  Four.
*  Wow.
*  Four years without seeing any other wolves.
*  Without having helped to kill your food item either.
*  That's what amazes me because he could have gone to Montana and found other wolves but
*  he didn't.
*  Was there any understanding of what he was basically, because they usually hunt in packs
*  So it was probably very difficult for him to take down anything larger than a fawn or
*  a deer.
*  So what was he eating?
*  I would guess he was killing elk calves, deer fawn, some deer.
*  And if he got lucky, if he had a really deep snow winter, it's the advantage of the wolves
*  because they got big snowshoe feet and elk, you know, punch through where they got little
*  sharp holes.
*  But he did well.
*  Whatever he did, we don't know.
*  We didn't follow him that long.
*  We didn't pick up scats.
*  It's just speculation.
*  They can kill a big elk, but they risk being killed every time they have to take a meal
*  like that.
*  Right.
*  They risk being dismembered too.
*  Like broken legs and broken jaws and getting kicked.
*  I saw a video of a wolf from Yellowstone last year.
*  It had been kicked in the jaw by an elk and it had a broken jaw that was hanging.
*  And a month later, a month, month and a half, it was healed enough and it was in the process
*  of killing another elk.
*  And wolves came along and killed the wolf, other wolves.
*  Once in his own pack, obviously, but he survived that.
*  Wow.
*  They're tough.
*  His jaw healed up and he got enough food while his jaw was healing.
*  Yeah.
*  That's incredible.
*  I imagine he was scavenging around, you know, picking up on kills and whatever.
*  How was he even chewing?
*  I don't know.
*  Because he's got a fork, you know, like a knife where you cut up the pieces.
*  He's got to bite pieces off with a broken jaw.
*  It's mind-boggling.
*  I mean, you know, people think, oh, wolves can just kill it.
*  Well, they can do whatever they want.
*  They have a hard life.
*  They just, they live in packs because they're not very efficient killers.
*  You know, Mount lions, bears, they're a more efficient predator, especially a Mount lion.
*  And they got all the claws to hang on, but a wolf can only go with its teeth.
*  And so it generally takes numerous wolves to successfully hunt an animal, especially
*  something big like a moose or bison.
*  What a friend said to me, so I wanted to run this by you to find out if this is true.
*  He said that Mount lions are killing more elk because of wolves, because what happens
*  is the Mount lion will kill the elk, but then the wolf will scare the Mount lion off and
*  steal it from them.
*  And so the Mount lion then goes and finds mule deer, finds another deer.
*  And so the Mount lions are killing more animals because in the areas where Mount lions and
*  wolves cohabitate, the wolves are really good at chasing Mount lions off of kills.
*  That does happen.
*  And I saw some in Glacier Park too, but to that end, I'll say there are three times more
*  Mount lions than there are wolves in Northwestern Montana.
*  Really?
*  Three times, two and a half to three, it's been documented.
*  So if you think about that, I would have never imagined that.
*  And Mount lions are on average a little bit bigger than wolves.
*  I don't know if you've ever hunted them or not, but my God, they're really...
*  I've never hunted a Mount lion, but I saw one in...
*  You did?
*  Yeah, I saw one in Utah a couple of years back and it was a big one, like a 170 pound
*  one.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  It was enormous.
*  Did they tree it with hounds?
*  No, no, we were driving and we were about 25, 30 yards from it.
*  And my friend stopped the truck and he said, look at the size of that cat.
*  It was under a tree and it was just as dawn or just as dusk was happening.
*  So you could see his eyes glowing.
*  And so I'm in the front seat of the car looking at him through 10X binos and just getting
*  a good look at his face.
*  It was incredible.
*  They're beautiful animals.
*  And I always think when I'm out in the woods, I got a little cabin way up Northwestern Montana.
*  I wonder how many times Mount lions have watched me.
*  Oh, a bit a lot.
*  I worry about Mount lions.
*  They're stealthy.
*  I don't worry about wolves.
*  Yeah, you should worry about Mount lions.
*  You're out there by yourself too, right?
*  Yeah, a lot.
*  Do you have like modern amenities up there?
*  Do you have satellite, internet, no ledges?
*  My little cabin is 55 miles off the grid and it's dry.
*  I don't have any water.
*  I don't have electricity.
*  No electricity.
*  It's way off the grid.
*  But I built it.
*  I took down an old historic homestead and I moved the logs up to where it sits.
*  You did it all yourself?
*  Well, no, no, I had help with a lot of friends helped me over the years.
*  It took me seven years from the time I got the logs and had friends help me take it down
*  till it was livable.
*  Wow.
*  Long time, because when I had money, I didn't have time and when I had time, I didn't have
*  money for building it.
*  But I eventually got it done and a lot of friends, very dear friends helped.
*  But I poured concrete and I cut logs and I did everything.
*  But when I built the place, where was I going with this?
*  Sorry.
*  You were just talking about what it's like out there.
*  No electricity, no water.
*  So for years, I've lived without and I haul water from a spring and in the winter I melt
*  the snow because we get a lot of snow.
*  But three summers ago now, I was there alone and I fell down the hard, the stairs, all
*  the wooden stairs and I broke the top of my foot.
*  And I said, you know, this isn't going to be very fun for a while because I got to close
*  up the cabin and I have a propane fridge and stove and I got to undo the propane and empty
*  the fridge and I got a lot of shutter because I'm not going to be back.
*  I got a broken foot.
*  So I'm hobbling around and I said, OK, now I'm going to get Starlink.
*  That was my motivator because if I had a phone, I could have called somebody for help.
*  But I didn't and I couldn't.
*  So after that, then I got on the Starlink.
*  They were still in the beta development.
*  I think anyway, I got on.
*  So I have Starlink available to me at my cabin, but only when I choose to turn it on.
*  It's not like if you were to email me or call me up there, you wouldn't get me.
*  And when I choose to turn it on, I get the messages.
*  So it's kind of the best of both worlds.
*  But I don't live there full time anymore.
*  I live in town.
*  That is actually the best of both worlds.
*  You choose to turn it on.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  I brought a portable one up to Utah with me and it's like smaller than this cigar box.
*  The new one that's got the router with it.
*  It's incredible.
*  It is incredible.
*  It's just so light.
*  I couldn't believe this was it.
*  And it works amazing.
*  Just point it at the sky and all of a sudden you're on YouTube.
*  For better or worse.
*  For worse.
*  Definitely for worse.
*  But it allows me to call home and talk to people.
*  There's good to it.
*  But it sounds like living up there must have been amazing.
*  But the water thing sounds like a real issue.
*  There was no way you could build a well?
*  I drilled a well.
*  I didn't hit water.
*  Oh, you only did one?
*  I did two and I didn't hit water twice.
*  But I'm on a creek.
*  I sit on a bluff above a creek.
*  The water is about 90 to 100 feet straight below me.
*  And I drilled my wells 140 feet.
*  But it's a really interesting limestone shale in the water.
*  I don't know how it works.
*  I even had a guy witch it for me.
*  Because I'm a scientist but what the hell it might work, right?
*  So they witched the spot.
*  I didn't hit water.
*  So you say witch.
*  Are you talking about with the sticks?
*  Yeah.
*  Divining rods.
*  Is that what it is?
*  Divining rods.
*  Is that real?
*  Like I said, I'm a scientist but if it might help, why not?
*  But I didn't hit water.
*  It doesn't seem like it could be real.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know either.
*  But people have been doing that for a long time and it seems like a massive waste of
*  time.
*  If you see if you can find a video of someone trying to find water with divining rods.
*  If you haven't seen it, they use two sticks, right?
*  Two sticks, sometimes metal but usually wood like a willow or something.
*  And they claim as they're walking around that the sticks move.
*  They cross.
*  They cross when you get to an area where there's water.
*  You're a scientist.
*  Tell me how that's possible.
*  How could it be possible?
*  Has anybody ever analyzed what factors could be at play?
*  I have to tell you.
*  I don't know and I'm kind of a skeptic on that stuff but I had somebody do it and we
*  didn't hit water so it's okay.
*  So here it is.
*  This guy's walking around.
*  It looks like he's got.
*  Those are probably metal like coat hangers or something.
*  Whoops.
*  Right there.
*  Coat hangers.
*  How is that possible?
*  I don't know.
*  So it just spins in his hands?
*  That looks like booger.
*  They crossed.
*  And then of course.
*  But then they're going to go sink and do it real well.
*  It might be two feet.
*  It might be 200 feet.
*  I don't know.
*  So he's walking.
*  He's not moving his hands.
*  They did.
*  Wow.
*  It does really look like they move on their own.
*  I, you know, there may be people in the world who have some kind of a gift.
*  Their electrical lights are different.
*  I don't know how it works.
*  I have been told that I can be a woman of science and superstition.
*  At the same time.
*  Yeah.
*  But I'm not.
*  Usually science wins.
*  Well, I bet you if you live in the woods a long time, you get a little bit of superstition,
*  a little bit of intuition, a little bit of you feel the woods a little bit differently
*  than you could measure on a scale.
*  I can think of twice only in my life.
*  Before I built my little cabin, I lived up this very even more remote outpost called Moose
*  City, loosely Moose City, because it was not a city at all.
*  It was an old homestead with a lot of empty cabins.
*  Twice up there, I got this feeling that there was something dangerous outside.
*  Twice.
*  And something just said to me, don't go outside.
*  And I'm not afraid of anything.
*  I mean, I spent my life dealing with wolves and grizzly bears and angry humans.
*  But I listened to those feelings because I don't know any different.
*  Why not?
*  Why not listen to it?
*  Like, I think we have some primordial part of our brains.
*  I don't know if you ever had that happen to you when you've been out walking or hunting.
*  I have not.
*  OK.
*  No, I've never had a moment where I was terrified, like something's out here.
*  Yeah.
*  And I have no idea what it was.
*  But I've never had that feeling around wildlife.
*  I tend to think it was human.
*  I don't know if we feel like we could human out there.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if we can smell and not register in our forebrain what we detect.
*  Maybe it's really primitive.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm just saying I had it happen to you.
*  I'm not around any people.
*  And then all of a sudden you feel a person.
*  I bet that kind of like any person that you run into in the woods is scary.
*  It's weird.
*  Like if you I always said that everything in the woods is scary.
*  Like if you saw a naked baby in the woods, you'd be like, what's that baby doing?
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Baby just standing there looking at you.
*  You'd be like, what the fuck?
*  Yeah.
*  There's something weird about the woods in general.
*  And if you were walking through a mall and a man was walking your way, it's just another
*  person like, hello.
*  Hi.
*  You know, you're at the park.
*  See a guy.
*  Normal.
*  But if you're in the middle of nowhere in the woods and you see another person, there's
*  this moment where you're like, what's this guy up to?
*  Who is he?
*  What's he doing?
*  Is he dangerous?
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that's because we're all raised in an urban environment more or less nowadays.
*  And so having lots of people around is normal.
*  But to have one person in a pretty remote area, we don't experience that very often
*  anymore.
*  But there's also no one is going to help you there.
*  Like if you're at the mall, it's very difficult for someone to get away with attacking you.
*  If you're alone in the woods, there is this weird, like if you're some crazy serial killer
*  guys out there, like, and you, you know, you're backpacking, you're like, uh-oh, like now
*  I'm at the mercy of this person if they're crazy.
*  I have a chapter in my book early in the book where I describe an event that I'm basically
*  been a real private person all my life until this book came out.
*  And once I wrote this book, I had to bring up stories that are very personal to me.
*  And I had an event one night that was terrifying, probably the most terrifying thing that's
*  ever happened in my life.
*  It involved humans.
*  So yeah, I totally get that.
*  People in places where they shouldn't be.
*  What happened?
*  Can you tell us?
*  Do you want to read it?
*  Do you want me to do the spoiler thing?
*  Well, we're talking about it.
*  Okay, I'll just give you the elevator speech part of it.
*  So I was in my cabin at night and the dog started growling.
*  I had very big dogs.
*  I always have dogs.
*  And I looked out my window and it was winter and it was cold and I could see a couple of
*  guys out there lurking around.
*  And I was in the middle of nowhere.
*  And then it kind of digressed from there.
*  So I for the only first and only time in my life, I pulled the gun on these guys.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I was in danger.
*  What were they doing out there?
*  Well, they came to pay me a visit.
*  They knew who you were?
*  They called me by name, which was really freaky.
*  So you think somebody in the woods walking around scary wait till you see somebody who
*  you don't know who it is and they call you by your first name.
*  That's freaky.
*  And what did they want?
*  I didn't find out because I pulled the gun on them.
*  I drove them off.
*  And it was terrifying to me.
*  It was not terrifying at the moment because I was absolutely focused, like predator focused,
*  calm.
*  But after they left, I started to shake.
*  Kind of after the adrenaline surge happened.
*  Were they menacing?
*  Yeah.
*  To me.
*  But with the way they were communicating with you?
*  They were drunk.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, it wasn't good.
*  And so how did they know who you were?
*  Do you know?
*  Oh, it's a long story.
*  But I was working up there.
*  I was kind of a novelty, a young blonde woman.
*  I was only about 25.
*  Living alone, studying wolves.
*  And at the time there were other people coming and going studying wolves.
*  But at that winter I was alone.
*  And I had been working.
*  It's a long story.
*  I was working behind the Customs Station right on the Canadian border and they were hauling
*  logs down out of Canada, bringing in the Customs Station.
*  They would have to transfer the logs to an American truck and then the Canadian trucks
*  would go back.
*  And I temporarily took a job as the knot bumper at the log deck landing, which means my job
*  was to run a chainsaw, trim off the branches, trim the length of the log to exactly fit
*  the log bed.
*  So I was around.
*  So these loggers knew who I was and I was cordial enough.
*  But it was two of those guys.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  And I never told the story until I wrote this book.
*  And I just thought it's a part of me that's very personal.
*  It's a part of me that I learned from.
*  It's never happened again.
*  And I had one old logger, old Bob, he saw me on the road the next day.
*  I was pretty shook up.
*  And he stopped.
*  We chatted often.
*  And he had seen a wolf.
*  He'd taken a picture of it.
*  So anyway, we chat.
*  And he says, so I hear he had some visitors last night.
*  And I looked it up because he's up in his log truck.
*  I said, yeah.
*  He says, you don't have to worry.
*  That won't happen again.
*  He's kind of like watching out for me.
*  Oh, that's nice.
*  Yeah.
*  Because we had kind of befriended each other because he'd spotted this wolf and he'd taken
*  pictures of it anyway.
*  Yeah.
*  So how did he find out that you had visitors?
*  The logger network, the CB radio.
*  I don't know.
*  I didn't tell anybody.
*  But he knew right away.
*  Hmm.
*  Yeah, it's humans that you have to be scared of.
*  Totally.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So anyway, you asked that.
*  There's no serial killer mountain lions.
*  Right?
*  They just have a purpose in nature.
*  Yeah.
*  They just kill because they kill because they eat.
*  That's what their job is.
*  People are weird.
*  Yeah.
*  People are creepy.
*  You know, saying about they're being weird.
*  I love that.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially men.
*  So when you were living out there, how many years did you live out there by yourself?
*  Well, off and on.
*  So when I arrived there, I joined a team of young researchers.
*  We're studying wolves and grizzly bears and we helped each other with their work.
*  So we started all that.
*  And then when we ran out of funding, then I was up there alone for about three years.
*  But other than that, there were people coming.
*  By yourself for three years.
*  Well, I had two dogs.
*  I wasn't totally alone.
*  And people were coming and going seasonally.
*  I had summer help and I had winter help.
*  But there wasn't people there on the shoulder season.
*  Does that get lonely?
*  You know, it's interesting because it didn't.
*  Really?
*  Back when I was younger, I was a bit of a misanthrope and I liked being alone.
*  And when I was alone, being alone is different than being lonely.
*  It just is.
*  Now as an older person, I feel different about people.
*  I'm more engaged with people.
*  I enjoy people.
*  So, yeah, I get lonely now.
*  But I didn't back then.
*  I mean, how could you be lonely?
*  You're living in the majestic mountains and wilderness of Glacier National Park and everything
*  is new and there's tracks to find and on and on and on.
*  Well, it's all amazing stuff.
*  But I would be lonely.
*  I like to be around people.
*  Well, that's why you're really good at what you do.
*  Because you're a social person.
*  You like to engage in conversation.
*  But I didn't used to be that way.
*  You went to Wannadu and interviewed me 30 years ago.
*  Let's put it that way.
*  Really?
*  I bet we would have worked out.
*  It would have been all right.
*  But I would have worked out.
*  I'm more conversational now.
*  I mean, it's just I would have been fascinated by who you were then because I'd be fascinated
*  by a person who doesn't want to talk to people.
*  Like if I could just peel back the layers of the onions to find out what that's like.
*  Like, because I would imagine there's a very different relationship with nature when it's
*  It's just you and nature alone by yourself for prolonged periods of time.
*  It's very different than taking a jaunt, taking a weekend excursion, hiking, even camping
*  for a week.
*  There's a big difference between that and living there for years.
*  Yes.
*  And it's sort of like, it's like when I go up to my cabin for a visit now, I no longer
*  live there full time, but I live there a couple of months a year, maybe three, maybe usually
*  two.
*  When I go up, it takes me like three to four days to decompress and get back into the mode
*  of, oh, I can't call.
*  Oh, I can't go on the Internet.
*  Do I want to hook up this darling?
*  No.
*  Go out and just sit outside and have a cup of tea and listen to the crick and then think
*  about what you're going to do for the day.
*  Go on a hike.
*  But it takes me a few days now to get to that frame of mind.
*  It doesn't.
*  It's not instant anymore.
*  So I've changed who I am.
*  And then once you get to that frame of mind, then you can just like today, we're going
*  to go on a hike.
*  Just bring the dogs.
*  Just go walk around.
*  Go fly fish.
*  Enjoy yourself.
*  Whatever.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And were you living off the land?
*  Were you catching fish for food and hunting for food?
*  Like, how are you getting your supplies?
*  I did that.
*  But I bought stuff in town and I would buy a lot in November while I could still drive
*  in because sometimes in the winter you couldn't drive in anymore.
*  So I would stock up and buy, you know, three, 400 pounds of dog food and bulk supplies of
*  flour and oats.
*  And I canned.
*  Back then, I actually did some canning.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't have time.
*  I don't care about it.
*  I can buy canned peaches or whatever.
*  And I never grew a food garden because of the bears.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  See, I didn't want to attract grizzlies.
*  Right.
*  So I didn't grow food except lettuce.
*  How often did you run into them up there?
*  They're always there.
*  But you don't see them very often.
*  So it's sort of like all the wild things that are up there are pretty wild.
*  And there weren't a lot of people up there then.
*  Now everybody's discovered Montana and there's people everywhere.
*  It's so interesting because our senses are so dull compared to theirs.
*  We move so slow and we're so loud and we're so clunky.
*  They see us a mile away.
*  They smell us a mile away.
*  They know exactly where you are.
*  And most of the time they just avoid us.
*  Totally true.
*  I mean, I've just come back from bird hunting.
*  I just was 31 days on the road and I just got home three days ago and I'm here.
*  And I was out bird hunting with friends.
*  And I said, I told them, I said, so when I hunt with my pointers, I get a griffon and
*  a wire hare.
*  I said, don't talk.
*  Don't call the dog's name.
*  Don't holler about.
*  Just watch and enjoy and smell and feel what goes on and trust the dogs.
*  If you see them getting birdie, get ready.
*  Because so many times you hunt with people and they're hacking their dog, they're calling,
*  they're hollering, they're talking to you about something going on over here.
*  Hey, did you watch the Vikings game?
*  Well, nobody watches the Vikings game.
*  Anyway, did you watch this?
*  It's like we're out there seeking a smart bird that has ears.
*  Watch the dogs.
*  So I feel that way when I'm out living in the wild too with out hiking.
*  I'm not going to see elk or bears or even fox if you're yammering away.
*  That's why I like being alone.
*  Yeah, that is part of the problem with people.
*  We do like to talk just to just be reassured.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, you know, and it's fun to interact.
*  But even when I go to Yellowstone, I go to Yellowstone at least a couple of times a year
*  to watch wolves.
*  I love the wolf watchers.
*  They're so enthusiastic.
*  But something's going on and you can't take a video because everybody's talking.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Even if the wolves are howling, you have to go shh.
*  I went to Yellowstone a few years back with my family and I felt like it was very weird.
*  I felt like I'm enjoying my daughters are really young at the time.
*  I'm enjoying that they're seeing bears and they're seeing well, we didn't see bears.
*  We did see they had there is this place in Montana that has this grizzly bear preserve.
*  It's like a place where they take care of bears.
*  So they would like feed them frozen watermelons, which is crazy to watch a bear chew through
*  a frozen watermelon.
*  Like it's a grape.
*  They just go right through it.
*  It's a frozen watermelon.
*  And they just come like it's nothing.
*  But we did see a lot of elk and a bunch of bison.
*  And the elk was strange because I'm sure you know this, but for the people at home, elk
*  understand that wolves don't come to these community centers, these areas where there's
*  vending machines and buildings.
*  So the elk are all over the place out there.
*  On the lawns.
*  So I don't know if I put it on Instagram.
*  I think I did.
*  I took a selfie with a cow elk that was like 40 feet from me just lying there.
*  And she wasn't worried about me at all.
*  And I was trying to tell my kids, I was like, this never happens.
*  This is weird.
*  Yeah, it's weird that they've become so habitualized to being around cars and people.
*  They just know the people.
*  It's safe when you're around these people.
*  So they just hang out there.
*  It's probably at Mammoth Gardener area that happens all the time up there.
*  Well it happens in Colorado too, like in Evergreen.
*  You see these huge herds of elk that walk down the middle of the street in Evergreen.
*  Because they know there's no mountain lines in the middle of the street.
*  No predators.
*  Right.
*  So they just like, in the rut, they're walking down the street and there's like 30, 40 elk
*  and they stop traffic.
*  And they're sitting on people's lawns and it's wild.
*  Sounds like bamf.
*  The same things happen to the wolves in Yellowstone because they were taken from Canada where
*  they don't see people and they had never exposure to livestock.
*  They're very wild at first.
*  And then they can't get away from humans.
*  So after a while, they just start disregarding people.
*  And like if they have to cross the road, there's a wolf jam and everybody's crowding with their
*  cars and they're trying to bring their pups across the road to a better spot.
*  And they can't even get through because of everybody.
*  So they get kind of laissez-faire about it and they get used to people, conditioned or
*  habituated.
*  And that's passed on to the next generation next.
*  And then when they leave the park, and they go outside the park and they walk down some
*  open public land spot where there's a hunter with a rifle, they don't think anything about
*  it.
*  So they're pretty easy targets.
*  That's unfortunate.
*  Yeah.
*  The habitualization is unfortunate because you just want to see them in the wild.
*  You don't want to see them in an intersection.
*  I know.
*  And yeah, it's tough.
*  And the unfortunate thing is a couple of years ago, there were 25 Yellowstone wolves killed
*  just outside of the park because they're used to people and they wander around.
*  Anyway, that's like out of a hundred.
*  So it's about a quarter of the population.
*  And there were a couple of particular individual wolves that were very well recognized and
*  by the wolf masses and photographed and they got killed in this.
*  This just went viral and these huge hatred for these people who shot these wolves because
*  they were so special.
*  And I make the point when I give talks and stuff, I said, you know, if you really feel
*  that strongly, you should really be concerned because every year there's about 300 wolves
*  shot that way in Montana, but you don't know them.
*  They're not famous.
*  They have just as important of lives.
*  They live, die, eat, breathe, get injured, heal up the same as these movie star wolves
*  in Yellowstone.
*  And you should feel that way about all wolves in my mind.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Well, that was the case with Cecil the lion.
*  You remember the dentist, you die in a dentist killed them.
*  They named him.
*  And so when they named and I remember after Cecil got killed, another lion got killed
*  and they thought it was Jericho who is Cecil's brother.
*  And there was a story like, oh my God, they killed Jericho, Cecil's brother.
*  And then they realized that Jericho was not dead.
*  So that, oh, it's fine.
*  Jericho is still okay.
*  But that lion is just a lion.
*  You didn't name him, but that's still another lion.
*  But because it's not this named lion's brother who also has a name, no one cared.
*  Exactly.
*  That's so bizarre.
*  It is bizarre.
*  I thank you for understanding that.
*  I forgot about Cecil.
*  When we were first monitoring the wolves and glacier, there was just a handful and we would
*  catch them and we would give them names because it's easier.
*  Like Phyllis was wolf 8550 and Mojave was wolf 8963.
*  They had both names and numbers.
*  And so when we did our scientific papers and reports, we used a number because we were
*  told by the officials that we don't want you to name the animals because what happens when
*  Phyllis kills a cow, if that happens, then you can't manage Phyllis.
*  So we went along with it, but we used the names and we did the scientific stuff with
*  numbers.
*  But then when you go into the park, people would want to know what's going on.
*  You need to talk about these different wolf numbers, 8654.
*  And they said, well, who is that?
*  Oh, that's Aspen.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And they would know by the name.
*  So whatever works.
*  Well, then all of a sudden they become like a pet.
*  More so.
*  Or even more like a majestic wild pet.
*  Like it's a different thing.
*  It's a pet that's this iconic North American apex predator.
*  Yes.
*  I know the wolves in Yellowstone, they don't have names.
*  They have numbers, but they're so identifiable by 907 or whatever that it becomes like a
*  name even though it's still a number.
*  But if you shoot 907, it's not as rude as if you shoot Jake.
*  Right.
*  Jake the wolf.
*  Right.
*  It's like, oh, yeah, Michael.
*  Michael.
*  You know, you name a wolf a human name and all of a sudden you shouldn't shoot it anymore.
*  I know.
*  Which is just a weird anthropomorphization thing, right?
*  It's been interesting to me because for my career I've done everything.
*  My first year, my first job, I worked up in northern Minnesota in a little tiny 300 person
*  farming community and I was hired, US Fish and Wildlife Service, to go in and help prevent
*  livestock depredation and when wolves killed cattle or sheep to go in and remove, which
*  meant trap and hollow away and they were euthanized.
*  And when there weren't depredations to go out and research trapped and put collars on
*  the other wolves.
*  And it was, I mean, this is big, big stuff for a girl from Minneapolis, pretty naive
*  to go up and save the folks of North Home from the wolves, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  It was such an important summer for me to learn professionally and personally.
*  And I wrote about that.
*  I learned a lot and it was interesting work, but I realized, yeah, wolves can cause conflicts
*  for people and it was a new concept for me.
*  So when they captured the wolves and they removed them, why did they euthanize them?
*  Why didn't they just relocate them?
*  Well they would be me because I was the one catching and trapping me.
*  Well, obviously someone was telling you what to do though, right?
*  Right.
*  So I had to bring them to the main office in Grand Rapids, Minnesota where they were
*  euthanized.
*  So prior to that, in 1978, you couldn't euthanize wolves.
*  They changed the status from endangered to threatened.
*  And so when they were threatened, then under endangered species act, you could actually
*  euthanize them.
*  And they didn't translocate them.
*  This is a really good question because they found over the years with studies in Minnesota
*  and eventually in Montana too, that when you translocate or move a wolf who's causing a
*  problem, that wolf very, very rarely survives to reproduce because it gets killed by other
*  wolves.
*  It comes back to depredate again.
*  It moves onto another farmer ranch and does it again.
*  They don't generally survive.
*  And so it was determined that it makes officials feel good to move them and it's a good facade
*  for the public to believe in.
*  But sometimes it results in a pretty prolonged and inhumane existence for a few months or
*  a year till they die anyway.
*  So yeah, it's...
*  Is it because they're habitualized to start preying on cattle?
*  It's tough once they learn to take cattle or sheep.
*  It's tough to break that pattern.
*  Let's put it that way.
*  Because it's so easy?
*  Well, yeah.
*  I mean, if it was me out there walking around and I had a choice between a deer that's going
*  to kick me in the teeth or take in the cow, I'd pick the slow dumb groceries every time.
*  It's just me.
*  Of course.
*  Of course.
*  I know the groceries are all penned up.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's a difficult challenge and wolves are continuing to expand everywhere in the West,
*  the Midwest, Europe.
*  And so there's more and more challenges and a lot of the early excitement about wolves
*  has changed into a bitter battle.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a really interesting complex battle because there's a lot of hunters that do not like
*  the reintroduction of wolves.
*  Yes.
*  And they'll say that the elk populations are down and they're down dramatically in Montana
*  because of the reintroduction.
*  What was it, 1996?
*  When was it?
*  95, 96 and then 96, 97.
*  Those winters.
*  But the reality is it's not natural to not have those predators there and you're going
*  to get an overpopulation of elk and that's going to lead to starvation and disease.
*  Yes.
*  And so kind of the die was cast when those wolves were removed and basically by the 1930s
*  there really weren't viable populations in the West anymore.
*  There are wolves here and there and a pack here and there, but there weren't thousands.
*  And they went into inside the national parks.
*  They have a picture in many books of rangers with cute little wolf pups that are like seven,
*  eight weeks old and they took the pictures.
*  This was in 1926 and then they killed them all.
*  So they even removed all the predators within national parks.
*  So people, historic memory, you know, we have really short memories.
*  Historic memory of, say for example, the northern range, northern herd range of elk out of Gardner.
*  It was about 20,000 before the wolves were introduced.
*  Way over carrying capacity.
*  Elk were starving.
*  The browse lines as high up as they could reach they ate everything they could eat.
*  They were paying people, people being paid to come in and kill deer and elk.
*  And then they started the late hunting seasons out of Gardner, which I went in because my
*  boyfriend had a time, had a tag and they just have a shooting line in February and kill
*  all these elk because they aren't going to make it anyway.
*  And so you shoot a starving cow in February because it wasn't predators.
*  So then when the wolves came back, two things happened.
*  Number one, it was a new predator.
*  Number two, in the winter of 96, 97, we had some of the deepest snows ever recorded in
*  the mountains, ever.
*  And so many of the herd died from snowfall.
*  And I've have hunters tell me, yeah, the population elk went from 20,000 to 10,000 in two years
*  to damn those wolves.
*  And it's like, do you think 35 wolves killed 10,000 elk?
*  Come on, let's just do the math a minute.
*  Yeah, that is the problem with people that don't have a nuanced perspective on what's
*  happening because they have a vested interest in it being a problem that the wolves are
*  keeping them from being able to be successful on an elk hunt.
*  Right.
*  And I'm a hunter.
*  I get it.
*  Yeah.
*  But the die-offs are huge.
*  Like the place that I was just telling you about before the podcast that I was in in
*  Utah, they lost 80% of their mule deer population a year ago.
*  From what?
*  Snow.
*  Yeah.
*  And so real bad winter.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And winter die-offs are a big thing.
*  It's a big thing.
*  I would say, to the best of my knowledge as a biologist, that winter die-off is the limiting
*  factor for ungulate herds.
*  It's not lions and bears and wolves and humans and cars.
*  Every so often, every 20 years or whatever, you get a massive winter die-off.
*  And it takes quite a while for those populations to build back up.
*  Predators can keep that at a lower rate.
*  They cannot affect it.
*  I have to think back to what people say about wolves killing all the deer now.
*  I think if you look to statistics at Montana and Wyoming, which you both have had a lot
*  of wolves for a couple of decades, they're giving away more elk permits.
*  I was just reading, they proposed unlimited elk permits in Wyoming.
*  And Montana's got basically in most of its management units more elk than ever.
*  I just say there's more going on than wolves.
*  And to point your finger at wolves all the time, you need to look at habitat.
*  You need to look at access issues.
*  There's a lot of places where hunters want to go shoot these elk, but they're on large
*  private ranches and you can't get on them.
*  Including landlocked public land.
*  There is public land where you're allowed to hunt there, but you can't get there.
*  Right.
*  You'd have to fly in a helicopter and a lot of places that's illegal.
*  Right.
*  And so there's all this talk of, for people that don't know, there's what one of the things
*  that happens is a thing called corner crossing.
*  Yeah.
*  So there might be a piece of public land that you're allowed to hike into.
*  And then there's a small area.
*  It could be a very small area, just a few yards even, of private land that you are going
*  to have to cross in order to get into the next piece of public land.
*  But people block access to that because these people that have these ranches and most of
*  them probably don't even live there and a bunch of wealthy people, they're terrified
*  that someone's going to go through that and then go into their private land.
*  They don't want to give people the access at all to their private land.
*  So they stop these corner crossings and it's a giant disaster because then you have these
*  areas that are public land that should be available to all of us and no one can get
*  in there.
*  Right.
*  I mean, if the viewers can think of imagining a checkerboard and you're trying to get from
*  one black square to the next black square, but you have to step over a tiny piece of
*  white square to get there, right?
*  Yeah.
*  It's being battled in court right now.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a disaster.
*  It is.
*  If I had land, I would carve out a big pathway and give it to the public.
*  Yeah.
*  Why, if you have 50,000 acres out there, whatever the hell you have, why is it so hard to take
*  a few acres and just make a path?
*  But you're not most landowners.
*  It seems so simple.
*  I know.
*  It's like the simplest of, you just make some sort of an easement.
*  Well, that would be good and some ranchers do, but many people and in this business,
*  they've been on their family ranch for four or five generations and they've had bad experiences
*  with hunters that come in and cut their fences, shoot their cows, leave their gates open,
*  and they just say, I'm done.
*  I'm closed.
*  And they get really angry.
*  I just hunted on a guy's ranch about a week ago up in central Montana, and he owns 60
*  sections.
*  That's 60 square miles of land, which may not be a big place in Texas, but for most
*  of the rest of the world.
*  That's huge.
*  It's huge.
*  He didn't give us permission, but he had to tell us all the challenges he's had and
*  why he had a big sign.
*  Don't even ask, basically.
*  But I know he was going to let us because some other friends of mine had hunted there.
*  But he had all these heartburns over things that had happened to him.
*  Hunters gave him a really bad taste in their mouth.
*  I as a single individual person can't do a lot about it, and I'd like to see hunting
*  really good ones help promote better hunter behavior and better hunter-landowner relationships.
*  You would be very generous to do that, but most people will not give an easement.
*  Well, I would understand that if you've been burned a few times and people have poached
*  on your land, and there's this attitude that people who don't have anything and they see
*  someone who has so much, and they're like, screw this guy.
*  I'm just going to go on his property.
*  Look, the elk are right there over the ridge, 400 yards away.
*  Let's just go over there, shoot those elk.
*  He won't even know.
*  We'll pack it out.
*  That happens.
*  Yeah, and then they get caught.
*  Then this guy's like, god damn it, they're poaching on my land.
*  Then he hates hunters.
*  Hunters are like everybody else.
*  There's people that are amazing plumbers, and they're real honest, and they work hard,
*  and they're sweethearts, and you're happy to hire them and call them.
*  There's people that are just liars, and they're crooks.
*  It's just like any other group of people.
*  Like anything else.
*  Exactly.
*  I know in my business with wolves, I've always tried to be very transparent and very honest.
*  If somebody asks me a question, I'll give them the best information I have.
*  If I don't know an answer, I'll say, I don't know, but you could call so-and-so who's maybe
*  had the experience with that.
*  I got nothing to hide by being dishonest or trying to sell somebody.
*  It's like hunting impacts of wolves on hunting.
*  You look at populations, and they go like this all the time.
*  Sometimes wolves cause it, sometimes not.
*  Sometimes it's winter, sometimes it's accumulation of lions and bears and wolves, but it's like
*  the stock market.
*  People want to see it do this.
*  Well, it's like the climate.
*  Exactly.
*  Nobody wants to admit to that either.
*  They hate looking at long-term data.
*  I know.
*  When people want to talk about the sky is falling, well, it's actually not.
*  Look at it over a long period of time, and you see this trend has always existed.
*  In fact, this is one of the cooler times in history.
*  We're facing interesting times.
*  It's bizarrely ideological.
*  I think the hardest thing is so much social media.
*  Everything goes on instantly, whether it's true or not.
*  Everything goes on instantly, and everything is ideologically connected.
*  There's people that just don't want any animals ever killed ever, and there's people that
*  want no predators and the easiest hunts possible, and they don't have a nuanced perspective
*  of the ecosystem, of what biology is and what these animals...
*  There's a whole world that they live in, and this world is interdependent.
*  There's so many things going on.
*  I remember there was a documentary that came out how wolves changed rivers in Yellowstone,
*  and they made this incredibly rosy picture of wolves coming in, and it brought in beavers,
*  and they changed the rivers and the lakes, and everything was better.
*  It's like, no, not really.
*  No, there's a lot going on all the time.
*  To single out this one aspect of this ecosystem and say this is the cause of this, there's
*  a lot of different causes.
*  There's a lot going on.
*  That film or the video ran viral big time, but there's no one species that's going to
*  make or break the world except maybe people.
*  But in terms of the impacts, no.
*  It's been shown since that video came out, the movie, that that might be true in a short
*  time period in small places, but it's not the global picture for Yellowstone Park.
*  Wolves have not saved the planet.
*  They just haven't.
*  It's just not that simple.
*  What they have done though is brought some balance, right?
*  I think yes.
*  You can go either way, and I think people who are out on either extreme can actually
*  make people in the middle more involved with conservation efforts, like that guy with the
*  movie.
*  Well, it's a rosy story, and pieces of it may be true in certain places for a temporal
*  or spatial time period.
*  But then there's the guy in, where was it, Daniels, Wyoming, who roared over that wolf
*  in the snowmobile and crippled it.
*  You heard about this, didn't you?
*  Wow, that's a terrible story.
*  And he brought it back, crippled, to the bar, and had it in the bar so people could be entertained
*  for an hour before they took it out back and shot it.
*  Now, that's a pretty horrific thing, whether it's a deer or a mount lion or a wolf, it's
*  horrible.
*  Any animal.
*  But that horrific act got a lot of people in the middle fired up to become more strong
*  conservationists.
*  So I'm sorry that that happened, but on the other hand, it brings a lot of awareness to
*  people who are not aware of the level of capacity of people to be stupid.
*  And evil.
*  That's evil.
*  When I saw the photos of the wolf, I'm like, that is an evil act.
*  That thing is incredible.
*  That's an incredible animal.
*  You have no right to do that.
*  And if you crippled it, if you crippled it with a snowmobile, the right thing to do is
*  to call someone or have it euthanized.
*  Shoot it.
*  Yeah, shoot it or call someone, but to drag it to a bar is just sick.
*  Well, I mean, he ran it over intentionally and he had a gun.
*  Oh, he did it intentionally.
*  Oh yeah, and he had a gun.
*  No, it was all for show.
*  The level of vitriol that people have towards wolves is very strange.
*  And I think it goes back to like the Little Red Riding Hood and, you know, the Big Bad
*  Wolf and there's just like this thing that we have in our mind that we don't have for
*  other predators.
*  We don't have it for bears.
*  We don't have it for cats.
*  No.
*  It's weird, right?
*  I thought about this a lot.
*  So why wolves?
*  What's the deal with wolves?
*  Why does it create that?
*  If you look at the facts, I mean, elk, coyotes, lions, bears, all coke machines, whatever,
*  kill people, lightning every year, lots of people.
*  Wolves it would be a very rare experience.
*  It occasionally happens, but it's so much rarer than everything else.
*  And yet people don't hate lions or grizzly bears.
*  I have a theory.
*  Okay, let's hear it.
*  I think it's a historical thing.
*  I think wolves are not a problem when you deal with civilization.
*  When you deal with agriculture and people have guns and people have land and they have
*  property.
*  But I think at one point in time it was a much bigger deal when there were larger populations
*  of them and they would hunt people.
*  They would attack people.
*  Are you aware of the World War I story?
*  About them eating corpses?
*  Well not just that, about the Germans and the Russians having a ceasefire because so
*  many people were getting eaten by wolves.
*  They actually, I talked to Steve Ronell about it once and he didn't, he wasn't even sure
*  if it was true.
*  So they actually researched it and found out it was true and they wrote an article on Meat
*  Eater about it.
*  No way.
*  So I haven't seen it.
*  So the story, I don't remember where I heard it from, but the story was, you know, the
*  thing about war, especially trench warfare, the horrific nature of it is that you don't
*  necessarily always kill people.
*  You shoot them and hurt them and wound them.
*  And these wolves were aware that these people were living in these trenches and that they
*  were wounded.
*  So they smelled blood and they came in and there were so many instances of people getting
*  dragged out of the trenches by packs of wolves.
*  And there were so many instances of parties going out like two or three men and then they
*  just find a boot with a foot in it and they realize like, oh boy, an animal's gotten them.
*  And so they decided to have a ceasefire between the Russians and the Germans to just get together
*  and kill the wolves before they go back to killing each other.
*  I'll have to look that up because I haven't actually heard it.
*  See if you can find that article.
*  I believe it's on meateater.com.
*  I'd like to know where the references are, thanks.
*  Was there a ceasefire during World War I to hunt wolves?
*  But I want to know what the references for the story were.
*  I think it's the New York Times.
*  Okay.
*  Multiple newspapers in 1917 report the story, including the El Paso Herald, Oklahoma City
*  Times and New York Times.
*  Since then, it's become a favorite bit of barroom banter among amateur historians.
*  Oh, like me, Joe Rogan.
*  February 19th, it says it there.
*  February 1917, a dispatch from Berlin noted large packs of wolves moving into populated
*  areas of the German Empire in the forests of Lithuania and I don't know how to say
*  that word, Volhynia?
*  Volhynia?
*  How would you say that word?
*  Close enough.
*  Locals hypothesized the war effort displaced the wolves so the canines started seeking
*  out new hunting grounds.
*  The hungry wolves infiltrated rural villages, attacking calves, sheep, goats, and in two
*  cases children.
*  They also showed up on the front lines, feeding on the fallen and sometimes taking advantage
*  of incapacitated fighters.
*  Hostilities of Russians and German scouts met recently and were hotly engaged in a skirmish
*  when a large pack of wolves dashed on the scene and attacked the wounded, reported a
*  1917 Oklahoma City Times article.
*  Hostilities were at once suspended and Germans and Russians instinctively attacked the pack,
*  killing about 50 wolves.
*  So these are one of the things that happens in Russia is you get these super packs.
*  I'm sure you've heard about those where they've had problems with them descending on whether
*  it's a cattle ranch or horses.
*  They've taken out horses.
*  Poison, rifle fire, hand grenades, and even machine guns were successfully tried in attempts
*  to eradicate the nuisance according to a 1917 New York Times article.
*  But all to no avail, the wolves nowhere to be found quite so large and powerful as in
*  Russia were desperate in their hunger and regardless of danger.
*  Yeah, I'm reading it too.
*  I just would say-
*  You're a little skeptical?
*  I'm very skeptical.
*  Number one, there weren't-
*  It says, though seemingly far-fetched, it turns out these claims are mostly accurate.
*  Historians estimate that soldiers killed hundreds of wolves during the war and that the surviving
*  wolves fled to escape a carnage the like of which they had never encountered.
*  Click on that link.
*  What is that?
*  But we're looking at news stories from 110 years ago.
*  I know.
*  Look at that, 1917.
*  Right.
*  Wild.
*  I'm just saying.
*  You're a little skeptical?
*  Well, they lie-
*  No, I'm not a little skeptical.
*  I'm very skeptical.
*  They lie in the news now.
*  I know.
*  Something happened.
*  I don't think they made up the fact that they all got together and shot wolves.
*  And have you read about Russian super packs of wolves?
*  No.
*  No?
*  Okay.
*  No, and I read the literature, but-
*  But this is recently.
*  Okay.
*  Within a few years ago, there was a problem with these super packs where they, I don't
*  remember what the theory was as to why they had formed such large packs, but there was
*  large packs of up to 100 wolves that were going into farms.
*  So my question about this story, and I'm not-
*  Largest wolf pack.
*  I'm just saying I'm skeptical.
*  2010, 2011, a super pack of wolves numbering up to 400 reportedly terrorized the Russian
*  town of, boy, good luck with that word.
*  Yeah.
*  Sounds like a vodka.
*  Vorkoyansk.
*  So what's the source?
*  Population of 1,300.
*  What's the source?
*  Guinness Book of World Records.
*  It's like Wikipedia.
*  Yeah, oh, they're a little better than that.
*  Wikipedia's sketch.
*  One of the remotest inhabited areas of the Northern Hemisphere, more than 30 horses were
*  killed in just four days.
*  And I remember reading about this in 2010.
*  It said, according to local officials, teams of hunters were established to patrol neighborhoods
*  and shoot the wolves on site.
*  Local experts suspicious of the claim say that wolves usually form packs of no more
*  than 10 to 15 animals, although the particularly harsh winters may have killed off the wolves'
*  usual prey, forcing them to attack larger animals.
*  This is a- this is multiple sources have this story.
*  And I remember it about a decade or so ago.
*  Well, I'd love to look up more detail, but I can tell you about- I can't tell you about
*  the news source, and I'm not familiar with that, and I don't read that kind of stuff
*  usually.
*  But if it's true, it's true.
*  I don't happen to believe it's true.
*  But what I can tell you about the true about wolf biology is wolves live in packs that
*  are generally a family group.
*  They have a genetic investment in their pack members.
*  There's oftentimes one or two that aren't related.
*  And they defend that territory to the death, whether there's five of them or 25 of them.
*  And that would be a large pack.
*  The largest pack I've ever heard of and was in Yellowstone, I think it was 34, because
*  three females had pups.
*  So to have 400 wolves move together-
*  Why would they do that?
*  What's the benefit to them?
*  They're gathering, collaborating with animals that aren't related to them that have no genetic
*  benefit to see them each survive.
*  And normally, packs that are not related kill each other.
*  It's the biggest cause of mortality in Yellowstone Park is wolves killing non-pack members.
*  Wolves are very, very intelligent, though.
*  Oh, I know.
*  Extremely intelligent.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And could you imagine a scenario where resources were so diminished that wolves recognized
*  that killing each other had no benefit and that moving together as a group, they could
*  do something to these farms.
*  So if you are a pack of 400 wolves and you choose to attack horses, that seems to me
*  a lot more success than three wolves or five wolves trying to do that.
*  I get you saying, but you ask, would I believe it?
*  And I have to tell you, no, I wouldn't believe it.
*  Well, this is based on your real life lived experience.
*  I wouldn't believe it.
*  Things do vary according to very unusual circumstances in terms of the environment, right?
*  So if there were 400 wolves that were starving, they would starve.
*  Unless they knew that there were horses.
*  You're giving them some human reasoning skills.
*  They don't think like humans do.
*  They just don't.
*  And I'm sorry, don't be if I'm not calling you a liar.
*  No, it's not me.
*  Listen, I don't know.
*  I'd have to investigate that.
*  But I'm 100% skeptical on it just because of everything that I'm familiar with.
*  But it doesn't, you know, stuff happens.
*  I have no pun intended, no dog in the race.
*  No dog in the fight.
*  But my thought is that in perhaps unusual circumstances like Siberia, where it's so
*  incredibly harsh, that if you do find a population that had been surviving because there was
*  a sufficient amount of wildlife for them to kill, and then all of a sudden there wasn't,
*  but there was farms, they all might kind of like descend on these farms and perhaps not
*  even fight for resources because they realized there was no benefit in that.
*  You asked me, I just said I don't believe it.
*  So I hear you.
*  I don't have anything to contribute further on that.
*  I guess you're just a science denier.
*  That's okay, Diane.
*  I'm a science denier.
*  There you go.
*  I like that.
*  Is that a fun thing to call people?
*  That's great.
*  It's such a horrible thing to say to people.
*  What are you saying?
*  So what is the largest that you've observed?
*  The largest pack that you've observed?
*  I have only observed probably 15, but that's not Yellowstone.
*  That's in my history.
*  And I know in Yellowstone, like I said, I know one year to get up to 34.
*  And I think probably the largest I've ever heard of being recorded that I know as fact
*  to it might be 40, but that's extremely unusual.
*  Is that Yellowstone as well?
*  Might be Canada.
*  I'm trying to remember my source.
*  I can't remember.
*  But 34 in Yellowstone, that's unusual.
*  The large number in Yellowstone was because of the unusual circumstances of the reintroduction
*  and a bunch of animals that weren't used to having wolves around?
*  Yes.
*  I think, well, three things happened.
*  Three different females had pups.
*  On average, they have six pups, seven pups.
*  So there's recruiting right there, 18, 20 pups right there.
*  In addition to the adults that were there, they had a good year.
*  They had lots of prey.
*  And so all of those pups presumably made it to their first year.
*  So for one winter, they were a huge pack and then mortality happens.
*  Wolves are not designed to live in packs of 34.
*  I mean, packs in the Midwest where the prey is smaller and the wolves are smaller, they
*  live in smaller packs.
*  In Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, average pack might be somewhere between 10 and 15.
*  And every year, you got to remember every year they have six to seven pups.
*  And by the next spring, they're back down.
*  That's six or seven through mortality or dispersal or whatever happens, hunting.
*  Yeah.
*  So stuff happens.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a hard life.
*  It is a hard life.
*  Another thing I've heard lots of people, well, I've heard several people and people I know
*  quite well tell me stories about they encountered a wolf or they encountered a wolf pack and
*  they were really frightened because they were, they had their dog with them and the
*  wolves are interested in the dog like little Carl there or something.
*  And the wolves were circling around and these people were terrified.
*  When they told me this story, two people, they told me this story and they said, yeah,
*  they could have killed me.
*  And my result, my response is, yeah, easily.
*  But you're here telling me this story.
*  Right.
*  So it's not very common for wolves to attack people.
*  That's just what I'm saying.
*  Not anymore.
*  Not anymore.
*  I know how good the reporting was way back when.
*  So.
*  But way back when, if you think about people that were living in a time where there was
*  no guns or at the very least muskets and you're dealing with people that are completely isolated
*  and you're dealing with harsh climates.
*  Like the homesteaders.
*  Yeah.
*  And there might be a time where the food source for the wolves is diminished.
*  The homesteaders didn't really have a problem with wolves though attacking people, right?
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Right.
*  But they had guns.
*  They had guns, they had poisons, they had traps, they had livestock, they had children.
*  That's just what I'm saying.
*  In this country with probably a, I don't mean to be offensive, but a better base of information
*  with all the opportunity in the world for all those things you just set up, remote living,
*  no protection, harsh winters like the winter of Charlie Russell paintings where all the
*  cattle are starving.
*  You didn't have packs of 400 wolves coming in and killing everyone.
*  I'm just saying.
*  Right.
*  I think it's a much more efficient environment than Siberia.
*  Siberia is unbelievably grown over here.
*  Oh, you asked those homesteaders.
*  Have you ever seen the Werner Herzog's documentary, Happy People, Life and the Taiga?
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't it amazing?
*  It's beautiful.
*  Incredible.
*  It's beautiful.
*  I just actually watched it within the last year.
*  I thought about that when I was thinking about you living alone by yourself.
*  Like that's how those people did.
*  They would go out there and they would just go with a dog and they would go live by themselves
*  in these cabins that they had fortified for the entire winter and just live out there
*  amongst the walls.
*  And they loved it.
*  They all loved it.
*  They all couldn't wait to get out there.
*  How many were killed by wolves?
*  None.
*  None.
*  But again, tigers.
*  Tigers are awesome predators on people.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Well, Siberian tigers, are they like known to kill people?
*  I know that.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't remember the name of the book I read.
*  It might just be called Tiger.
*  I'm trying to remember the name, but it's a story of a predatory tiger and these guys,
*  the story of the tiger's life and how they go to finally try and kill it.
*  It's a terrifying story.
*  Wow.
*  In Siberia?
*  It's a true story.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's modern times.
*  There's something super scary about a tiger in the snow.
*  Oh my God.
*  A cat that's 600 pounds stalking you.
*  In the snow.
*  No, thank you.
*  No, thank you.
*  No, no.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just a matter of whether or not you zig when you should have zagged and you're in the
*  wrong spot of land where he's at.
*  Yes.
*  And I think that tiger had an injury that was caused by humans.
*  And that's often the case.
*  It wasn't able to hunt real proficiently.
*  Or in the recording, I mean, when you're reading the book, you get the drift that it had a
*  vengeance against humans because it was injured.
*  I would imagine that's probably the case too.
*  Could be.
*  Just as they're scared if they survive a situation.
*  There we go.
*  The story of Vladimir Markov, a poacher who met a grizzly in the winter of 1997 after
*  he shot and wounded a tiger and then stole a part of the tiger's kill.
*  The injured tiger hunted Markov down in a way that appears to be chillingly premeditated.
*  The tiger stalked out Markov's cabin, systematically destroyed anything that had Markov's scent
*  on it, and then waited by the front door for Markov to come home.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no doubt that animal, according to the story here, definitely had vengeance on
*  its mind.
*  Wow.
*  It was an impulsive response.
*  Valiant says, the tiger was able to hold this idea over a period of time.
*  The animal waited for 12 to 48 hours before attacking.
*  When Markov finally appeared, the tiger killed him, dragged him to the bush, and ate him.
*  The eating may have been secondary, Valiant explained.
*  I think he killed him just because he had a bone to pick.
*  The book is called The Tigers.
*  They have the title, right?
*  Wow.
*  It's a fascinating story.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, it's interesting because with-
*  Look at the footprint.
*  Oh my God.
*  Look at the size of that.
*  Look at the guy's hand next to the footprint.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's amazing.
*  Oh, that's the author with the size of a female's paw print.
*  So that's a female.
*  That's a small one.
*  That's a small one.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Fascinating story.
*  And then there's this, the tiger is just trying to be a tiger.
*  Is that a photograph of those guys?
*  It looks like a drawing.
*  1885.
*  1885, yeah, different.
*  So is that-
*  Different time era.
*  Is that a photo though?
*  Yeah.
*  Boy, what a shitty photo.
*  I wouldn't buy it.
*  If somebody said that's a photo, I'd go, get out of here.
*  You drew that.
*  It's 140 years old.
*  Come on.
*  But some of the interesting things looking at that is like in Glacier Park or anywhere
*  I play were wolves overlap with, with Mount lions, which we call lions, Mount lions and
*  grizzly bears and coyotes and whatever.
*  When they, they kill one of their other competing predators, just like that tiger, they don't
*  usually eat it.
*  It's secondary.
*  It's to kill off a competitor.
*  So wolves don't get eaten by Mount lions?
*  They do get killed by Mount lions occasionally, right?
*  Occasionally.
*  One of the Colorado wolves that was just introduced was killed by Mount lion.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  One of the 10 that was just introduced.
*  So they kill them because they are a competitor.
*  And one on one, 120 pound cat and a hundred pound wolf, one on one, the cat's going to
*  win.
*  But when you have a pack of wolves, I mean, we've watched them treat the cat and they'll
*  wait till they can get it.
*  They'll wait.
*  But one on one, the cat doesn't have a chance.
*  But no, I mean-
*  The wolf doesn't have a chance one on one.
*  You mean?
*  Right.
*  I mean, when the cat won and you got a pack of eight waiting.
*  Right, right, right.
*  But we documented a case where the wolves treat a cat and it couldn't stay up with the
*  tree any longer.
*  It was on a skinny lodge pole and it was sliding down.
*  And as soon as it got to the ground, they killed it and they just ripped it apart and
*  they didn't eat any of it.
*  Wow.
*  It's strictly to vanquish a competitor, just like the tiger.
*  It's interesting because wouldn't you think that food is scarce and that meat is precious
*  and that if they did kill the mountain lion, they'd realize, why don't we eat this thing?
*  Well they had better options.
*  Have you ever eaten mountain lion?
*  I have.
*  It's good.
*  Yeah.
*  I had it once too.
*  That's why it's weird.
*  Actually, you know what?
*  Wait a minute.
*  Did I eat it?
*  I don't know how I have.
*  Why do I feel like someone gave me some?
*  I don't think I ate it.
*  I think it's in my freezer.
*  I think somebody might have served it to me somewhere.
*  Like the backstrap of a lion.
*  The loin.
*  It looks like a pork tenderloin.
*  It's very light colored.
*  I've only eaten it once.
*  Steve killed one and cooked it and he said it was tremendous.
*  He called it superb.
*  He said it was like a superior pork.
*  Without the fat.
*  He said it was really good.
*  Which is like most people would not think you even eat mountain lion.
*  Wolves apparently either.
*  That was what I was reading about one of the trappers, one of the original people that
*  was traveling across the country in the 1700s.
*  His favorite meal was wolf.
*  Oh you're kidding me.
*  No.
*  This guy was eating wolf meat.
*  I don't think it would be very good.
*  They're skinny and stringy and sinewy.
*  Yeah I don't know why.
*  I mean I don't know why that would be anyone's favorite.
*  Then maybe that's like a cool thing to tell people.
*  I like eating wolves.
*  You know you find some guys who wants you to be scared of them.
*  What is he eating?
*  He's up there alone.
*  He's eating wolves.
*  That's his favorite.
*  He lives by himself and he just eats wolves.
*  Doesn't that sound like something a man would say?
*  Or worse yet, wolverines.
*  Oh right.
*  Imagine eating wolverines.
*  No.
*  Anyway, no.
*  I'm glad you showed me that stuff because it's nice to know the stuff is still out there
*  and alive and well.
*  I hear it all the time.
*  I hear about the Canadian super wolves.
*  There is a thing about mammals, right?
*  That mammals as they get into a colder range they are larger mammals.
*  If you see, let's say, northern Alberta white-tailed deer versus an Arizona white-tailed deer.
*  To a certain point and then when you get to where it's so cold and arctic that the resources,
*  the availability to get food is diminished.
*  Like arctic wolves on Ellesmere Island are pretty small and they're white.
*  Because they're tiny.
*  They don't have any food.
*  They're smaller.
*  The Piri's caribou up there are smaller than say the caribou in Alaska.
*  It's hard to make a living.
*  But yeah, northern climate like the wolves from Canada, most of them are pretty big and
*  same with the, everything.
*  What's the resource issue, right?
*  This is the reason why most people think when they think of grizzly bears, grizzly bears
*  have a very similar size but then you get to coastal brown bears.
*  They're much larger and it's really just access to protein, right?
*  Salmon.
*  Yeah, you got it.
*  I went to McNeil to watch the bears and yeah, my god, they're just enormously fat.
*  They're almost obscene waddling around with their rolls, you know.
*  Having a good old time hibernating.
*  They're so content because they have endless food resources.
*  That's why you can have tourists go up and sit and watch grizzly bears feeding within
*  100 yards of you sometimes.
*  Eating salmon and you're under no danger.
*  Why would they bother you when they have thousands of pounds of salmon in the river?
*  There's a fantastic video.
*  I don't know if you've ever seen it, but there's a photographer and he's got like a little
*  lawn chair set up and he's photographing all these enormous brown bears that are feeding
*  off salmon and this one walks up and gets as close to him as where Jamie is to us.
*  And it's huge and it just sits next to him.
*  Oh my god.
*  It sits next to him and looks down, watch it, this is it.
*  That's a big bear.
*  Look at that little folding chair.
*  Oh my god.
*  I mean just imagine that.
*  That is literally where Jamie is.
*  Oh my god.
*  And it doesn't care at all about these people.
*  It's not thinking of them as a food source.
*  No, my question is why did the bear bother?
*  Because he's looking at the river.
*  He doesn't even care that the people are there.
*  He's just like looking at the river going hmm, let me take a nap here.
*  So he just chills out.
*  Oh my god.
*  I mean any other time, so if you were in the middle of the forest and you saw that first
*  of all they wouldn't be that big in the middle of the forest, but if you saw a bear like
*  that in the middle of the forest it would be absolutely terrifying.
*  He'd be scared of you, you'd be scared of him.
*  You'd have your bear spray out.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at this guy, he's so close.
*  And the bear just sort of walks off like see ya, bye.
*  Because he's got so much food.
*  I kind of had a similar experience, McNeil not that close, but close enough that I was
*  uncomfortable.
*  I live with bears because I'm used to bears that have skinny resources and they're voracious
*  and they're pretty aggressive in the fall.
*  They can be because they're getting into hyperphagia where they got good enough calories to hibernate.
*  And if you keep them from getting their calories it's you or the huckleberry badger maybe or
*  you or the elk that you just hung in the woods the night before and you went back to get.
*  That happens.
*  People hang their game in the woods and they go back the next day and a grissy bear's found
*  it.
*  Do you have a story of that?
*  No, no tell me.
*  You never, oh my god.
*  No.
*  They were on a Fog Knack Island.
*  Where's that?
*  It's in Alaska.
*  It's connected to, it's like one of the island chains that's right near, what is the big
*  one where they find all the big brown bears?
*  Kodiak?
*  Yeah.
*  So it's right off of Kodiak.
*  So they were elk hunting and they shot an elk and you're talking about.
*  Elk hunting on that island?
*  Yes, elk hunting on a Fog Knack, yeah.
*  It's a very hard hunt.
*  Incredibly difficult hunt because of the terrain.
*  It's almost impossible to traverse.
*  So to get a few miles takes hours and hours and hours.
*  So they go through this, they're basically bushwhacking through this incredibly dense
*  terrain.
*  They find an elk, they shoot the elk and then they're very far from camp.
*  So they take some of the meat and then they hang the meat in the trees and you know they
*  set up.
*  They didn't know that when they came back the next day that a bear had claimed that
*  elk.
*  So there's a gut pile, there's all sorts of stuff there for the bear, obviously the smell
*  of the meat.
*  And so they, it took a long time to get where the bear was and they all sat down.
*  There's a large group of them because they were filming for this television show.
*  My friend Remy Warren, my friend Yannis Poutelis and then Steve and a few other people working
*  on the crew.
*  They sit down to have lunch and little do they know that there is an enormous like 11
*  foot bear that had claimed that and he comes running through the camp.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  And one guy, our friend Dirtmouth was actually on his back.
*  The bear plowed through the camp and through the people and just I don't think it recognized
*  how many people were there so it didn't know exactly what to do.
*  So he wound up literally on the back of a bear for like 10 to 15 yards.
*  Oh my god.
*  Before he fell off of it.
*  So then the bear goes in the woods and starts woofing.
*  None of them had their guns out.
*  None of them were ready.
*  They were just eating lunch.
*  They really fucked up.
*  They made a huge tactical error.
*  They also ignored scat which they weren't sure like whether or not that was a bear that
*  had recently been, you know, so they were there for quite a while, guns drawn, like
*  trying to fend off this bear.
*  So they eventually got out of there.
*  But both Steve Rinella and Remy Warren have told the story on my podcast and it's bone
*  chilling.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I hadn't heard that when I saw Steve.
*  Steve said that this thing was literally feet from his head gnashing its teeth as it's running
*  through the camp.
*  And it's enormous.
*  He said, you have all these thoughts in your mind of what you would do and how you would
*  And he said, it's just reptilian.
*  Like your brain goes to the most base survival.
*  There's a recognition of this enormous predator.
*  Unbelievably sobering experience.
*  Yes.
*  And what I would point out with that is that that bear had every chance in the world to
*  kill every one of those guys.
*  It didn't hurt any of them.
*  Well it was just trying to protect its kill.
*  It thought it was its.
*  But his theory was that the bear didn't realize how many people were there.
*  It wouldn't matter.
*  They weren't armed.
*  And as it ran through the group it didn't know who to hit.
*  Like Janis hit it in the face with trekking poles.
*  Hit the bear in the face?
*  Janis!
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Hit the bear in the face with trekking poles.
*  Like that close to him.
*  Imagine a head that big.
*  No.
*  That close.
*  And you hit it with trekking poles.
*  Right.
*  Ah!
*  And it just ran past them.
*  Probably not knowing which one to target or what to do.
*  And then they got their guns out and then I don't know exactly how they eventually got
*  to a point where they felt confident enough that they could walk.
*  And then walk with meat on their back.
*  So they went there to pack out.
*  And they have all these guys so they can make the pack out a little bit easier.
*  So now you're walking even slower because you've got 50 pounds on your back.
*  Maybe they left a little behind.
*  They should have.
*  That's a good move.
*  I mean yeah I probably would have.
*  Leave the shoulders and the neck.
*  Yeah.
*  At least something.
*  At least something to fill them up.
*  But my point is that bear could have run through and killed one of them or all of them in a
*  moment of anger.
*  It didn't.
*  It did a bluff charge.
*  It turned around.
*  It woofed and gnashed its teeth.
*  Yeah.
*  And it could have killed them.
*  Seriously.
*  Sure.
*  Even if they had their guns it would have killed one or two of them.
*  Right.
*  And then we have this happen a lot in Montana.
*  Every year at least one person is killed by a bear or many can be injured.
*  And the thing that's common is they say the bear charged them and before that it was woofing.
*  And a lot of times they do what's called a bluff charge.
*  But people don't want to wait until a bear's 15 feet away to figure out if it's a bluff
*  charge or not.
*  So they shoot them.
*  And bear sprays is very, very effective because you can do a longer distance and it's accurate.
*  But I personally don't.
*  The science shows and many of your listeners won't believe this.
*  The science shows that average hunter is better off with a bear spray than a firearm.
*  But in a moment of panic you can't say what you would do.
*  Better off to survive?
*  To survive with less injury or at least less fatal.
*  And people have sprayed a bear that's attacking somebody and the bear breaks off and leaves.
*  Of course you've got to deal with the after.
*  Have you ever been around bear spray, pepper spray?
*  Yeah I have.
*  Oh my God.
*  Maybe you did it in the...
*  We pepper sprayed a bunch of people on Fear Factor once.
*  It's awful.
*  How did you get everybody to go off camera and get...
*  Yeah you run away because the...
*  You can't breathe.
*  It was tear gas.
*  Now that I'm remembering.
*  So what we did, we put these people in this cement structure.
*  It was like how long can you tolerate it.
*  I forget exactly what the stunt was but the wind took a lot of it and blew it through
*  the crew and we were all running away and it was in your eyes.
*  And I'm sure tear gas is probably pretty similar to the effects that you get from pepper spray.
*  I think pepper spray, yeah.
*  It might even be worse.
*  Otherwise they'd have tear gas for bear repellent and they don't.
*  They have pepper spray.
*  I'm sure.
*  It's bad.
*  But I'm just saying and people can argue this and it all depends on the situation but in
*  general bear spray is a more effective tool because you can spray it three times past
*  where you're sitting and the bear hits that spray and they run away.
*  And I guess I've heard the bear biologist say to me, try shooting a rolling tire at
*  40 miles an hour and see how accurate your shots are because that's what you're shooting
*  at if a bear is charging you.
*  And it's difficult to keep your act together.
*  That's the big problem is panic.
*  Right.
*  It's not necessarily the killing factor.
*  It's just that you're not going to hit very well.
*  Whereas if you have bear spray it's just this cloud you're spraying out.
*  It's more effective.
*  It's like you had a flame thrower.
*  I always carry bear spray when I'm hiking.
*  You don't carry a gun?
*  No.
*  Really?
*  Unless I'm bird hunting.
*  Does bear spray work on cats?
*  I've heard it and I have never heard about it being used on wolves because generally
*  wolves aren't sneaking around.
*  But if I had a cat stalking me lying on, boy you bet I'd have my bear spray out.
*  Yeah.
*  Absolutely.
*  You've never been in a situation where you had a cat stalking you or close to you?
*  Not that I saw.
*  Oh that's what's scary right?
*  Exactly.
*  You probably have a few.
*  Have you?
*  No, not really.
*  No.
*  I had one kill my dog in Colorado.
*  A little dog.
*  A little tiny.
*  Sorry.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a bummer.
*  But there's a big difference I think between what you see and what's there.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I think if you had infrared vision for the heat detector and you could see what's out
*  in the woods you'd never go outside to take a leak when you're at your cabin.
*  You probably wouldn't.
*  No.
*  Because they are so aware of you.
*  And everything's out there.
*  We're basically almost blind.
*  Yes.
*  Especially at night time.
*  We're almost blind.
*  Yes.
*  And they have senses that are beyond our wildest imagination.
*  We were talking earlier today where someone brought up that stuff that hunters use to
*  spray on them to kill their scent.
*  I go listen to me.
*  That shit is nonsense.
*  First of all, whatever that stuff is, they're going to smell that stuff.
*  Exactly.
*  And it's not going to hide your scent.
*  I don't know the science behind it.
*  I don't want to kill anybody's business.
*  As you were with the wolf thing, I'm super skeptical that a deer or an elk is not going
*  to smell you if you spray some junk that you bought from Cabela's on you.
*  I'm not going to kill anybody's business either.
*  But I can tell you from traps too, I do the same thing.
*  I'm incredibly careful about scent.
*  But they can still smell it.
*  Just be as careful as you can be.
*  I just don't think we can even imagine the kind of sense that they have.
*  The kind of ability to smell and hear with those enormous ears and those noses and those
*  eyes they can see at night.
*  I think we're just guessing.
*  It's almost like when you try to imagine the size of the universe and someone says, oh,
*  it's 13.7 billion years old.
*  Light years.
*  Okay, how big is that?
*  Someone tried to explain it to me in a way that actually resonated that it's similar
*  to how you can smell skunk except much more directional.
*  A skunk can die a mile away and you can smell it, which is really weird because there's
*  no other scent like that in the nature that you can pick up one animal, sprays one thing
*  a mile away and you're driving in your car.
*  You're right.
*  You're like, oh, you smell that?
*  Skunk around here, which is crazy.
*  What this guy was saying to me is now imagine that but directional and better and that's
*  like what a bear can do.
*  Or a wolf.
*  Yeah, I've read studies and if the wind is right, I've read several miles so you can
*  smell something.
*  Unbelievable.
*  It is unbelievable.
*  Incredible.
*  Yeah, I think the whole scent thing is way beyond our ability to detect.
*  When I've been burying these traps after being so careful with everything and it's kind of
*  voodoo and science mix, it's art and science and you bury everything, you bury the trap,
*  the hook, the grapple cable, I mean just everything and then you cover it up and it's been in
*  the ground two weeks.
*  Nothing's disturbed it and then one day you see where a wolf has come by, taken its paw
*  and dug at the backside of the trap and lifted it out by the spring and pulled it up onto
*  the trail, not snapped and then there'll be a scat two feet away.
*  Wow, like fuck you.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Why do they do that?
*  Well, maybe because they know it's there and they probably have had some experience in
*  their life with traps.
*  But why mess with it at all if they know it's dangerous?
*  Right.
*  I mean, yeah.
*  What do you think they're trying to like tell people?
*  I'm not that stupid?
*  My imagination and my theory is that maybe this is a wolf that's already caught, it's
*  been caught and it's got other pack members that are naive.
*  And it stops because it smells, it's like, oh man, I know what this is.
*  Maybe it's time to show Junior what's going on here and maybe they pull it out.
*  I don't know.
*  Have you ever seen the video of they caught a rat and the rat takes a stick and blows
*  the mousetrap so it can get the food?
*  No kidding.
*  The rat actually brought over a tool to spring the trap and purposely springs it.
*  I haven't seen the video but I've watched it.
*  The problem I have with the video is I don't know the source.
*  I don't know if they trained this rat.
*  They may have.
*  So they may have done that just to make a viral video but it's still pretty extraordinary
*  that this rat figures out it can take a stick and it moves it and puts the stick on the
*  rat trap.
*  The rat trap springs and then it goes over to it.
*  By the way, it doesn't even flinch when the rat trap springs.
*  Kidding.
*  No.
*  Let's see if we can find it, Jamie.
*  It's really weird.
*  Yeah, this is it.
*  So he smells it.
*  He smells it.
*  It's a big rat trap.
*  Yeah, so he goes away and I'll check this.
*  Now the thing about him not flinching is the craziest.
*  So he gets the stick.
*  He's had experience.
*  He lifts it up and drops it.
*  He didn't flinch.
*  He didn't flinch at all.
*  Isn't that insane?
*  I mean imagine you're a wild animal.
*  He may have been trained.
*  It seems like it.
*  Something.
*  Maybe he's done it before.
*  But there was something weird about it where he must have known that that's going to happen.
*  The camera with the full eye reflection sitting indoors in a room.
*  That doesn't smack of wildness to me.
*  That's something that's...
*  Well, it's rats.
*  It's not really wild, right?
*  They're domesticated in some sort of a weird way.
*  Well, you know, there's as close to as many rats as there are people in New York City
*  by weird estimations, which I'm sure they don't have a good accurate account of how
*  many rats there are.
*  But there's so many of them.
*  And there's an amazing documentary called Rats that's on Netflix.
*  And it's really good.
*  And it shows you how intelligent they are.
*  And one of the things that they do is they take the young brash rats and they let them
*  go try the food out first, see if it's poison.
*  Because they've been poisoned so many times.
*  So they'll get this young dummy.
*  It's like, I'll eat it.
*  Send Sam.
*  Sam's a dumbass.
*  So Sam the rat runs over and eats the poison and gets sick and they're like, let's get
*  out of here.
*  And they take off.
*  But they have some very bizarre survival instincts that's highly tuned to this recognition that
*  they're being at least tried, not preyed upon necessarily, but something trying to kill
*  them.
*  Right.
*  And they're not eating them.
*  Some weird situation where it's poison.
*  So they've figured out what poison is.
*  So they'll like send...
*  They're really smart.
*  Crazy.
*  So they'll send a dummy to go out, a young guy to go out and eat the poison.
*  Give it to Mikey.
*  Mikey likes everything.
*  What kind of natural adaptation is that?
*  And what is that from?
*  I'm sure you're aware of this, but there's a very bizarre study that they've done where
*  there's a concept called morphic resonance.
*  And the idea is that once one animal learns this, the other animals will learn it easier.
*  And that this is scientifically proven.
*  And that the idea is that there's some sort of a sharing of information that is not local
*  and that we don't totally understand.
*  So the concept is the way it's been proven is that rats on one side of the country, if
*  they go through a maze, the rats on the other side of the country will go through the maze
*  quicker.
*  The exact same maze.
*  See if you can find that.
*  So they don't know what this is.
*  I think we have a very naive belief that the senses that we have recognized, all of them,
*  whether they're sight, sound, touch, taste, whatever they are, this is it.
*  This is all that's available.
*  And that the concept might, the idea is that there might be something that we're missing.
*  Or something that we really, we as dumb blind human beings in terms of our ability to see
*  things, we don't have the ability to tune in to what these animals can tune into.
*  I think there's a huge portion of our brain that we never, never touch.
*  And I think animals are more tuned in.
*  I think in many ways, many species are smarter than us just because they can sense their
*  environment more acutely.
*  Yeah, maybe smarter is not the right word.
*  Maybe not.
*  But there's something.
*  Rat learning and morphic resonance.
*  So according to the hypothesis, formative causation, there's no difference in time between innate
*  and learned behavior.
*  Both depend on motor fields given by morphic resonance.
*  The hypothesis therefore admits a possible transmission of learned behavior from one
*  animal to another and leads to a testable prediction which differs, or to testable predictions
*  which differ not only from those of the orthodox theory of inheritance, but also from those
*  of the Lamarckian theory and from inheritance through epigenetic modifications of gene
*  expression.
*  So animals of an inbred strain are placed under conditions in which they learn to respond
*  to a given stimulus in a characteristic way.
*  They're then made to repeat this pattern of behavior many times.
*  X-hypothesis, the new behavioral field which will be reinforced by morphic resonance, will
*  not only cause the behavior of the trained animals to become increasingly habitual, but
*  will also affect, though less specifically, any similar animal exposed to a similar stimulus.
*  The larger the number of animals in the past that have learned the task, the easier it
*  should be for the subsequent similar animals to learn it.
*  Therefore in an experiment of this type, it should be possible to observe a progressive
*  increase in the rate of learning not only in the animals descended from trained ancestors,
*  but also in genetically similar animals descended from untrained ancestors.
*  This is pretty wild stuff.
*  It's pretty wild, yeah.
*  It just speaks to this, I think we naively look at our senses as being the only ones
*  that are available.
*  There's obviously some kind of communication that transpires between animals that allows
*  them to hunt in packs, right?
*  Particularly wolves.
*  They have strategies.
*  Yes.
*  They do things.
*  They know how to corner animals.
*  They know how to funnel them into pinch points.
*  They do it on purpose and they seem to be aware of what they're doing through, whether
*  it's gestures or pheromones or something that we're just guessing on, but they're accomplished
*  at it.
*  It's not like a singular individual event that you could point to like maybe that was
*  just dumb luck.
*  They ran the deer through this area and the other wolves just happened to be there.
*  No.
*  No, they have specific tasks where they have wolves that will get on the top of the ridges
*  and let themselves be known so they get these animals running.
*  And then the other wolves are ahead of them and then they have wolves that follow behind
*  them.
*  The Yellowstone has been a great place to observe hunting.
*  I mean, when I was working up in Northwest Montana, it's heavily forested.
*  We almost never got to watch wolves chasing prey unless we were in the airplane.
*  But in the Lamar, you got scopes and everybody's watching it.
*  And I've seen some pretty incredible chases and there's certain, in some packs, certain
*  individuals are the chasers, the younger animals, and some of the individuals are the coup de
*  gras.
*  They go in for the kill after the animal's been tired.
*  And I guess there was some older animals that are too valuable potentially to risk being
*  injured early on, but they join in the chase and they know how to kill an animal.
*  So one thing I've always wondered, I don't know if this is with the morphic resonance,
*  but that's something different maybe.
*  But I've always wondered when wolves were first walking down from Canada and dispersing
*  from Glacier before wolves were reintroduced and there was a very thin population of wolves
*  out there, how do they know where to go?
*  For example, there is a wolf pack in the Nine Mile, it's a river drainage, outside of Missoula.
*  This pair of wolves had formed a mating system and they had a litter of pups.
*  The female was poached on Memorial Day, which is, those pups are born in middle April, so
*  they were pretty young.
*  They were five, six weeks old.
*  They were still dependent on mom.
*  And the concern was that the dad wouldn't be able to raise those pups because he's got
*  to go out and hunt and they're just being weaned and blah, blah, blah.
*  Two weeks after the female was dead, my colleague Mike, who was working down there, says, hey
*  Diane, are you missing any collared wolves from Glacier?
*  I said, yeah, I'm missing several that I don't know where they went.
*  He says, because I just had a collared wolf show up here and joined the Nine Mile male.
*  I said, really?
*  I said, well, here's my list of frequencies of the missing wolves that had been missing.
*  And he ran through the receiver and listened and one of those wolves was one that I had
*  caught in Glacier and disappeared six, seven months earlier.
*  So like so she wandered around in not cyberspace, but mountain space, trying to look for a place
*  to fit in.
*  And all of a sudden, when this female gets shot, boom, she's there to fill in the slot.
*  How does that happen?
*  And that happens in Yellowstone, too, where one of the breeding animals will be killed.
*  And very soon after, a wolf of unknown, well, there they know a lot of the wolves, but a
*  wolf would just show up the right gender, the right age and potentially bond and start
*  a new pack.
*  How do they know?
*  And I guess all I can say is with that, there's scent, the wolves smelling the urine in the
*  scat can detect all kinds of things harmonically and the dominance of an animal.
*  If the female went missing, all of a sudden they won't smell it anymore.
*  And maybe it's a female coming in and she knows it.
*  But geographically, how do they know where to migrate?
*  Right.
*  And all of a sudden show up exactly when the other wolf disappears.
*  Well, they've been trying to figure out forever what's going on with birds and how birds like
*  sandhill cranes, for example.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, Canadian geese.
*  Like what's going on?
*  Like, how are these birds figuring out these incredible migration paths?
*  Right.
*  It's amazing to me.
*  So have you ever heard of the book called World on the Wing by Paul, I think the last
*  name is Whedon, now it's something.
*  It's about the world of migration.
*  It is mind boggling.
*  If you like to read nature stuff and science, it's written so anybody can enjoy it.
*  You don't have to be a scientist.
*  But it's fascinating and full of facts about the world of bird migration and how they get
*  places and like a particular important flat in China that was critical habitat for a group
*  of birds suddenly gets developed.
*  And it's like the wintering ground for half a million of these birds or whatever it was.
*  And certainly, where do they go?
*  Right.
*  I don't know.
*  Every birds are very fascinating.
*  Oh, I know.
*  And like what are they following?
*  And what GPS do they have in their little tiny brains?
*  They have little tiny brains.
*  But yet they're able to use something like there's a theory that it's the magnetic poles.
*  Right.
*  Or the stars or whatever.
*  The stars really?
*  I never heard that one.
*  I just heard a lot of stuff.
*  I've had I remember.
*  Yeah.
*  One winter.
*  One winter night I was at my little remote cabin and it was at Moose City and it was
*  stormy and it was like November.
*  It was stormy and I went outside to use the outhouse and I heard this calling and it was
*  dark and stormy and I was calling and calling and got closer and closer and I put my bright
*  flashlight straight up and there was a flock of snow geese.
*  I never seen snow geese up there.
*  Never.
*  And they were circling around and they were lost in the storm.
*  And there's no lights up there except for my house light and my flashlight and they
*  were circling around the meadow and I listened to that haunting call and I thought how are
*  they going to survive it?
*  This is the valley bottom.
*  Are they going to try and go up over the mountaintops in the storm?
*  Are they going to crash land in the meadow for the night?
*  Anyway, I got to thinking about them.
*  I thought why?
*  How did they get here?
*  They got blown off course.
*  I just shut my light off and I don't know what happened to them.
*  Never saw them again.
*  Wow.
*  But I think about these birds.
*  A lot of them die migrating.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't have a good ending.
*  They fly across the entire ocean.
*  It's mind boggling.
*  Mind boggling.
*  They sleep while they're flying.
*  I know.
*  I wish I could do that when I was driving.
*  I try sometimes.
*  One of them is a very big bird.
*  Albatross.
*  That's right.
*  Albatross.
*  And they literally sleep while they're soaring across the sky.
*  Yeah.
*  They just put out those big old wings.
*  Just ride the wave.
*  Yeah.
*  For months or years.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean it's crazy.
*  Right?
*  Like what are you doing?
*  So why are you doing that?
*  There you go.
*  Albatross can fly nonstop for over 16,000 kilometers.
*  Wow.
*  That is so crazy.
*  For example, a gray headed albatross flew 13,670 miles around the world in 46 days in
*  2005.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's crazy.
*  Laysan albatross can travel 1,600 miles on foraging trips to feed their chicks.
*  Large albatross species can spend up to five years at sea.
*  Albatross can go up to six years before returning to the island where they were born to mate
*  and lay eggs.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Yeah.
*  I got to see albatross one time when I was down.
*  I think it was down in New Zealand.
*  But they were amazing.
*  I like the comments.
*  It's crazy here.
*  We're talking about how they can fly over vast areas without flapping their wings.
*  They just use the wind, expending almost none of their own.
*  Wow.
*  So it would be interesting to me.
*  I would hope the day would come with wolves and other large carnivores where people learn
*  about the science and they get just as excited as this instead of the wolves have killed
*  all the deer now.
*  Well, I think there's a narrative in this country, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I think the narrative is first of all, they were killed off a long time ago by poison,
*  by ranchers and by settlers.
*  And because of that, we grew up with this narrative that they had to kill off the wolves.
*  So then these damn hippies come and vote and bring, and I wanted to ask you about that
*  too, what your feeling is on biology that's done by vote, which is how informed are these
*  people that are casting this vote?
*  How emotional is this?
*  And how much of these decisions that people are making?
*  One of them being that I think was particularly egregious was the delisting of grizzly bears
*  in BC.
*  Because I have a good friend who lives up there and he's like, there's a lot of grizzly
*  bears up there.
*  They will still allow black bear hunting, but they're not controlling the grizzly bear
*  population because of the people in Vancouver.
*  That's the large population.
*  They have the most votes.
*  They decided to go outlaw what they call trophy hunting.
*  And so biology by vote, by people that probably don't know anything about what's going on,
*  they don't have to, other than have this emotional response.
*  But I think going back to what we're talking about is that we have this narrative that
*  the wolves were bad, the wolves were killed off for a good reason.
*  We don't want wolves.
*  Oh my God, people are bringing back wolves.
*  What are they doing?
*  We want to kill those damn wolves.
*  And so there's a good percentage of the population that lacks this nuanced perspective of the
*  complexity of the ecosystem and how amazing, first of all, how amazing it is to be able
*  to see wolves.
*  Like if you're a per, I've never seen them in the wild.
*  I saw one once.
*  Did you?
*  Yeah, in Alberta, but it was so brief.
*  It was dusk.
*  It was like, it was actually after last light.
*  So it was running across this dirt road.
*  I was like, a wolf?
*  There are a lot of wolves up there.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Plenty of camera trap photos of these wolves.
*  So that's most likely what it was.
*  And they give out wolf tags.
*  You can get as many wolf tags as you want up there.
*  But good luck finding one.
*  You know, they're a lot smarter than you or a lot better at living in the woods than you
*  are.
*  Yes.
*  But we have these, these ideas that are ingrained in us that the wolves were killed off for
*  a good reason and they're only being brought back because of morons.
*  Well, you summed that up pretty well.
*  Isn't that how people feel about it?
*  Yeah.
*  So a couple of things.
*  I as a wolf conservationist, I guess I'd say, and researcher and a wolf lover and manager.
*  Well, don't you love them?
*  I love wolves.
*  I love dogs.
*  I love foxes.
*  I love white tailed.
*  I love wildlife.
*  That's better.
*  And I'm kind of in the middle, but obviously I'm passionate about wolves.
*  And I lean towards whatever we need to do to ensure that they continue as a species.
*  I'm not saying they're going to live in Iowa and Texas.
*  I'm just saying there's places that they can live where they more likely belong.
*  I'm just going to put it that way.
*  But I am not in favor of reintroductions.
*  And I was not in favor of the Yellowstone in the central Idaho reintroductions, which
*  usually surprises people because I promote wolf conservation.
*  I felt that wolves were coming down on their own from Canada.
*  And before those wolves were ever reintroduced by 1995, we had like eight packs of wolves
*  in the state of Montana, 70, 75 wolves.
*  And you can Google that with the US Fish and Wildlife Service early reports.
*  They were making it.
*  And I feel like some of these places where reintroductions are happening because of ballot
*  box initiatives like Colorado, wolves are already starting to get to Colorado.
*  And the people who are wolf proponents say we want them reintroduced because they'll
*  never make the great desert across Wyoming.
*  They'll all be killed.
*  They can't make it.
*  Well, a few of them have.
*  And they even made pups in 19, I think it was 2020 or 2021.
*  And then this wolf was, did I tell you about the wolf from Michigan?
*  Yeah, the wolf that was killed, trapped in Colorado this year that came from the Great
*  Lakes.
*  My God, how did it get there?
*  But it did.
*  I feel sort of that Colorado is on the cusp of natural recovery.
*  If it's going to be one year or 10 years or 50 years, it's a time issue.
*  And I think the same was true for Yellowstone and Central Idaho.
*  They were already getting to those places.
*  Wolves had already been seen, two of them confirmed, in and around Yellowstone Park
*  in 1991 or two before they were reintroduced.
*  And my wolf's going to Idaho.
*  It's just a slower wave.
*  And people want to jumpstart this with reintroducing wolves.
*  Well, in my humble opinion, I'm not a psychologist, but I think that social tolerance of humans
*  for anything is better when it isn't forced on them.
*  I don't like having things forced on me.
*  Of course.
*  Yeah.
*  So when you force wolves on somebody, it's going to meet with human resistance.
*  If they walk there on their own, I believe they will get there.
*  Our science has shown that they do.
*  It just takes longer.
*  The other thing of interest about the reintroductions is that people think the wolf-loving hippies
*  push to have the wolves reintroduced into Yellowstone and Idaho.
*  I'll just say Yellowstone, but it's the same.
*  And to some point, it is that faction.
*  But the reason it happened was because two conservative senators, one from Idaho, McClure,
*  one from Wyoming, Simpson, very conservative ranching supporting base, promoted to Congress
*  to pass laws to get those wolves reintroduced because they could see the writing on the
*  wall that the wolves are coming anyway.
*  And if they walk down there on their own, they're going to be fully endangered.
*  Well, if we reintroduce them, they get a different classification called non-essential experimental
*  population.
*  Meaning because humans put them there, you can manipulate them and kill them if they're
*  taking livestock.
*  It's just more flexible management.
*  So the senators thought, well, we're getting there anyway.
*  Let's just put them in there.
*  So yeah, that's a little bit of the interesting background that people aren't aware of with
*  the reintroductions, that it was really people way on the right and way on the left coming
*  towards a common goal for different reasons.
*  Want to see a crazy video of a wolf that was in Bakersfield?
*  Yeah.
*  In California.
*  Yeah.
*  My friend filmed this.
*  So this wolf, he was driving down the freeway in Bakersfield, California, and they looked
*  off and there was this wolf.
*  I've sent you this, right, Jamie?
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think you still have it?
*  I know Cody sent it to me.
*  I can find it.
*  So my friend who was out there filmed this wolf off the highway.
*  And this is like five miles from an In-N-Out Burger.
*  Sorry.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's in California.
*  I mean, we're talking about an hour 40 from Los Angeles.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Yeah.
*  And he was speculating that perhaps this wolf was brought there by someone.
*  Damn, it might be on my other phone.
*  Did I send it to you, Jamie?
*  I know I saved it.
*  I can find it, but this might be a little bit of a pain in the ass.
*  Maybe it's here.
*  So this wolf was very cool looking, like this very big black wolf.
*  And he's like wandering around these cows.
*  And then someone comes and shoes him away and he runs off.
*  Huh.
*  Damn, I don't have it.
*  Does he have a collar on?
*  No, he does not.
*  I think I read about this wolf.
*  There's a wolf that went down through the central California Valley and ended up going
*  down through the vineyard country.
*  And I think it was probably that wolf that it was seen.
*  Oh, probably.
*  I mean, there's not that many wolves there.
*  And a lot of people are super skeptical, like how would a wolf wind up there?
*  But what you're saying in terms of the amount of land that they can travel on is insane.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  And so, whoops.
*  Hundreds and hundreds of miles.
*  Historically, back eons of time, wolves had the largest global distribution of any mammal
*  in the world except people.
*  I mean, wolves live from the Arctic to the prairies to the temperate forests to the Gaza
*  Strip still.
*  And they live...
*  Really?
*  There's wolves in the Gaza Strip?
*  There's wolves in the Netherlands right now.
*  Wolves have expanded.
*  They will live anywhere that we don't kill them off because they did historically.
*  I mean, there were wolves on Staten Island, I'm sure, historically.
*  Now we have different wolves there.
*  But I'm thinking, yeah, anyway, stock market.
*  Wolves of Wall Street?
*  Exactly, that's where I'm going.
*  But they live anywhere because they can eat anything, but mostly what they need is four-legged
*  hoofed mammals, usually deer, elk, caribou, moose, whatever, occasionally livestock.
*  They need a place where they can secure that they can whelp and raise pups.
*  And then they need a freedom of persecution from humans, being it traps, poison shooting,
*  whatever.
*  If you have enough of those three factors, they will be there.
*  They've been showing up in Iowa and Missouri and the Dakotas for years and years now, but
*  they don't make it because they get killed.
*  But they're trying.
*  Yeah, I think I might have saved it under wolf if I look.
*  There's videos.
*  I'd love to see that video.
*  There's a thing that you can do now with your iPhone where you can just search for wolves.
*  Really?
*  You can search for stuff.
*  Show me the werewolf in the lobby.
*  Show me all the pictures I have of Carl and Marshall.
*  Is that showing you that one wolf?
*  No.
*  But you saw one or your friend did?
*  No, my friend did.
*  He filmed it.
*  I know I had the video.
*  So, if you get a chance, Joe, if you're really interested in seeing wolves, just take a trip
*  to Yellowstone and go, I would suggest not in the summer because it's just crazy.
*  I'd go in the winter.
*  You can hire a wolf tour guide or you can go on your own, just stay at a hotel, but
*  you've got to get up before dark.
*  What was that, Jamie?
*  It was those mountain lions crying.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And you've got to go out dawn and dusk.
*  In the wintertime, they're easier to see because of the snow.
*  And it's really fun depending on the season.
*  If you go in the fall, they've got bigger pack because the pups are all still alive.
*  If you go in the winter, they've got breeding behavior and stuff going on.
*  There's always something to see.
*  I go there myself, but I know a lot of the wolf watchers, I just drive the roads until
*  I see people pulled over and I get out and watch.
*  They might be a mile away.
*  They might be 400 yards away.
*  But bring a scope and I'd suggest you just hire a guide.
*  You'll see wolves.
*  I'd hear them.
*  It'd be cool.
*  Yes.
*  It's amazing to hear them howling.
*  One thing we did come across when I was hunting in B.C., we were moose hunting about 10 years
*  ago or so, and we found a calf that had been killed.
*  And it was really interesting because they had stripped it down to the bone.
*  And what was wild was all the hair.
*  There was hair everywhere.
*  I didn't even think of that.
*  I didn't think there'd be hair everywhere for some stupid reason.
*  How long ago were they killed?
*  Was there anything left?
*  It was pretty recent.
*  It was real recent, like within the day.
*  Really?
*  I know that's on my Instagram.
*  Wasn't it a bear kill or a lion kill?
*  No, it was a wolf kill.
*  Yeah.
*  My friend who was up there.
*  I just asked because bears and lions both pluck and strip hair off.
*  That area had a lot of wolves.
*  And he was very accustomed to finding calves that had been killed by wolves.
*  We found it because of birds.
*  Sure.
*  The birds were circling.
*  It was like, let's go see what's over there.
*  Yeah, magpies and ravens are my best friends when I'm out looking for kills.
*  Yeah.
*  And then interesting, like that's how you find things.
*  You find the birds.
*  It is.
*  Yeah.
*  And how do they find it?
*  You know.
*  So there's been stories written and there's a guy who does a lot of raven studies.
*  His name escapes me right now.
*  They're so smart.
*  Yeah.
*  He's done some really interesting studies of the ravens.
*  And if you ever watch the videos of crows solving puzzles and ravens, oh my god.
*  Incredible, right?
*  Next life I want to come back as a raven.
*  Not only do they solve puzzles, but they figure out how to raise water levels so they
*  can get the food in a jar.
*  Think about that.
*  They drop rocks into the jar until the water level raises so they can get the food that's
*  floating.
*  Yeah.
*  The raven guy's name is Bernd Heinz.
*  He's German.
*  Bernd as in Bernie with Bernd.
*  Bernd and Heinz.
*  Yeah.
*  Anyway, it's cool stuff.
*  I mean, this is, I mean, you and I are both obviously very interested in animals.
*  We hunt our own food.
*  But just when I'm out hunting, I feel a little bit like a predator.
*  Not a lot because I got a gun.
*  But I watch the dogs who are basically predators.
*  And I watched animals in the landscape and it just, you see so much when you're out hunting.
*  I'm sure.
*  I mean, what's the coolest animal you've ever seen when you've been out on the landscape,
*  hiking or hunting or anything?
*  That mountain lion that we saw might have been the coolest.
*  That was the coolest.
*  But I saw a badger once.
*  I got a film of that.
*  I actually got out of the truck and got next to him, got close to him.
*  Then he started coming towards me and I ran.
*  I was like, what's wrong with me?
*  Like, what am I stupid?
*  They're blonde wolverines.
*  That's really what they are.
*  He looked fucking terrifying and not very big, but like ferocious.
*  I've caught a couple in wolf traps.
*  Such a cool looking animal.
*  They're so cool looking.
*  I just couldn't imagine that I was seeing one like it was in Utah.
*  Seeing one in the wild.
*  I've seen, I saw one grizzly.
*  And it looked at me so much different.
*  It looked different than any bear I've ever looked at.
*  I've hunted black bear before and I've been around black bear many, many times.
*  This is the first grizzly and it was so different the way it looked at me.
*  Where was it?
*  This was in BC.
*  No, excuse me.
*  This was in Alberta.
*  And this one was not a big one.
*  He was about six feet tall, but he looked through me.
*  It looked different.
*  Like a black bear looks at you like, who are you?
*  What's this?
*  What are you doing over there?
*  Are you food?
*  Are you going to kill me?
*  What are we doing?
*  They're a little sketched out because they're not the top of the food chain.
*  The grizzlies are.
*  And so the grizzly looked at me like this.
*  Like right at me.
*  We had shotguns.
*  We screamed at him.
*  He wasn't scared.
*  Yeah.
*  And my friend Jen, she slammed a stick against a tree like, get out of here bear.
*  And cocked the shotgun.
*  The bear took off.
*  But it was the difference in looking in their face.
*  They just have a totally different look.
*  They look at you like this.
*  Like, am I going to get you right now?
*  It's just a grizzly has a hard life.
*  It's not like that brown bear that has all those salmon that's sitting by the river.
*  Those grizzlies are out there like trying to survive.
*  Yeah.
*  Grizzlies in the Rocky Mountains are quite small compared to the coastal brown bears
*  and the same species.
*  But they're very different.
*  And they have to make a living.
*  I mean, if you had to make your living picking huckleberries and eating gut piles in the
*  fall, it'd be skinny.
*  And they have to put on a lot of weight.
*  Well that to me is so fascinating how animals change their behavior based on the amount
*  of resources that are available and whether or not they're safe.
*  Like the Yellowstone elk that are habitualized that are just around people hanging out with
*  them.
*  And Banff.
*  You ever been to Banff in the fall?
*  No, I haven't, but I've seen photos.
*  They're bugling and mating on the post office lawn.
*  Literally.
*  It's smart for them though.
*  Absolutely.
*  No hunters.
*  And people just pull over to pull their phones out and film them.
*  I think I've heard of occasionally wolves find out and they sneak into town at night.
*  Well weren't you telling a story on Steve Ronell's podcast about a very nice neighborhood
*  of like these nice homes and these wolves that decide to set up shop?
*  Yes, it was a closed gated community between Whitefish and Kalispell.
*  And they had their pups in this closed gated community because there's no hunting.
*  It's unlimited green space and undeveloped forest because people have McMansions and
*  they have huge acreage and it's just quiet time.
*  There's not a safer place and the people there like them because they don't have livestock.
*  They're usually not hunters.
*  It's great, except then they grow up and they have to leave.
*  So then they go out in the real world and then they get their asses kicked.
*  Yeah, right.
*  That's a problem because then you're like a wolf growing up in a gated community, literally.
*  And you've learned that people are okay.
*  You learn that people are okay and there's deer everywhere.
*  Because the deer know that people are okay and the deer are not used to wolves being
*  there.
*  Right.
*  It's really interesting.
*  Yeah, that pack didn't make it.
*  I'm not surprised.
*  Right.
*  But it was just so interesting to me how adaptable wolves are.
*  You know, when I first started this business, I come from Minnesota and the wolves lived
*  only in the northern third or quarter of the state where it was boundary water, canoe area
*  and really wild because anyplace else they got killed off.
*  So I always thought these wolves were denizens of the wilderness and they would only live
*  where it was incredibly wild.
*  And they've come to show us that's not true.
*  They will live wherever we'll tolerate them.
*  And that could be it.
*  I mean, there were wolves in Texas not that long ago.
*  Red wolves.
*  So they were here.
*  But you know, they're just not tolerated.
*  How much of a problem is it where they kill pets?
*  It's a giant mountain lion issue, especially in northern California.
*  One place outside of San Francisco, they did an analysis of the diet of mountain lions
*  that they had captured and it was 50 percent pets.
*  But of course, it's a bias survey because it's by San Francisco.
*  So it's not.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's just fascinating that they had actively chosen to hunt pets.
*  If I was a mountain lion living near San Francisco, I'd be eating poodles and chihuahuas and cats.
*  Absolutely.
*  Easy prey.
*  There are a lot of them.
*  Nobody's going to shoot you in California.
*  It's illegal.
*  It's a charmed life until you get run over in the freeway.
*  Well, it's probably one of the reasons why you don't hear about that in Texas, because
*  in Texas, they're like vermin.
*  You can shoot as many mountain lions as you want.
*  If you see a mountain lion, you shoot them just like a coyote.
*  That's interesting.
*  I didn't know that in Texas.
*  You don't need a tag.
*  You don't need anything.
*  Really?
*  Yep.
*  It's amazing they're still hanging on.
*  There's the wolf.
*  Oh, it's...
*  How'd you find it, Jamie?
*  Wow.
*  I found out that it was on the Adam Green Tree episode, 2015.
*  Ah, beautiful.
*  You see the white triangle?
*  Thank you, Jamie.
*  You're the best.
*  You see the white triangle on the chest?
*  Yes.
*  That's the younger wolf, because the pups can be born...
*  Can you wind that back again?
*  Yeah, thanks.
*  Awesome.
*  This is my friend Cody.
*  He filmed this off the highway.
*  Awesome.
*  He had a spotting scope.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  He put a phone up.
*  Look at that.
*  That's amazing.
*  The white chevron, pups, younger wolves have that, and as they get older, like the rest
*  of us, they get gray.
*  That doesn't stand out so much.
*  So it would probably be a yearling, maybe a two-year-old wolf.
*  Interesting.
*  What their speculation is...
*  Wow.
*  You know, he works on a ranch.
*  Wow.
*  Their speculation is that someone released that.
*  And they think these rogue wildlife lovers are really...
*  Look, cows right there.
*  The cows.
*  These rogue wildlife lovers are releasing wolves to try to force some sort of a reintroduction
*  into central California.
*  I know for a fact that there was a wild wolf that was tracked going down through central
*  and to Bakersfield.
*  I don't know if it was black or gray, but I know there was one.
*  So it's not unprecedented?
*  No.
*  It's not.
*  My friend Kent Loudon does the wolf work in California.
*  He's a biologist, used to be in Montana and Idaho.
*  And no, they're making a comeback.
*  I think there's six packs now, and they're doing really well.
*  Mostly northern California?
*  Northern California, yeah.
*  And there's lots of conflict because they can't...
*  They can't...
*  I'm pretty darn sure.
*  They cannot kill the wolves that are killing livestock, so it's set up for a conflict,
*  kind of like in California.
*  They're having some management flexibility in California.
*  I mean in Colorado.
*  But so far, I mean they just now...
*  So a pair of wolves that they reintroduced found each other and made a pack, and they
*  had the only litter of pups known to be in Colorado this year.
*  I believe both of those wolves came from Oregon, and they both had livestock killing experience
*  before they chose them to release, which is really unfortunate.
*  So the dilemma was, okay, they did okay until people started calving.
*  And now there's little calves on the ground, and now the wolves are coming in and they're
*  starting to kill calves, and then they might kill a heifer or something.
*  And anyway, they're killing livestock.
*  So what do you do?
*  You got a male and a female and a litter of pups, and they have started a history of killing
*  livestock.
*  What do you do with them?
*  A slight majority of people in Colorado, the ballot box initiative stuff, want to see all
*  the wolves protected, and a slight minority, it's like 49 and a half to 50 and a half or
*  something, want them removed.
*  And the people in the middle are trying to figure out what to do, so they went and captured
*  them and put them in a holding facility for a while, and they're going to release them
*  later.
*  Well, you still have a problem.
*  Because they still are habitualized.
*  They will probably likely to continue killing livestock.
*  It's hard to find...
*  Are the ranchers reimbursed?
*  Is there a fund for that?
*  In Montana there is.
*  I presume there is in Colorado, yeah.
*  They're reimbursed, but as I've worked with ranchers and they said, I didn't raise my
*  cows for your damn wolves to kill them.
*  I don't care.
*  I don't want the money.
*  I just don't want the wolves here.
*  And sometimes when you're working with a rancher community, that's the only common denominator
*  you have is you're out there because you don't want their cows killed because then wolves
*  have to get killed.
*  They don't want their cows killed because they raised them for all these generations.
*  They have a good pool genetically.
*  They are invested.
*  So that's the same common goal.
*  And you might have different reasons to come to that goal, but that's how you work with
*  people.
*  You know how it is.
*  There's always a common denominator.
*  I was watching a documentary about this guy who lived with wolves, like lived with wolves
*  in some contained environment and he would like set up a fake kill where he would eat
*  the liver so he could be like the dominant male and he would growl at them.
*  It was really stupid.
*  Sorry.
*  Yeah, you're right.
*  I'm with you.
*  Anyway, this gentleman who was a wolf expert was then recruited to try to help a sheepherder
*  with wolves that had moved in to take over his flock.
*  And one of the strategies they used is giant speakers.
*  So they took speakers and they played sounds of wolves to scare off these other wolves.
*  And so then he goes back to the pack and tries to be the alpha again and they corner him
*  and snarl at him and he had a whimper and he had a...
*  It's a very weird documentary because this is some sort of a strange fenced in environment
*  that they've created where these wolves are living.
*  Sounds a bit like Timothy Treadwell.
*  Very similar.
*  It's the same deal.
*  Very, very, very similar.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I think that's from the movie The Werner Herzog, another Werner Herzog film, Grizzly
*  Man.
*  Oh, that was amazing.
*  Amazing movie.
*  Yeah.
*  An unintentional comedy.
*  Maybe intentional.
*  I think it was a little bit intentional because there's a few cuts in there where you're like
*  that...
*  He had to know that was funny.
*  And I think that was Suicide by Bear.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I think.
*  And the girlfriend too.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that guy and the girlfriend unfortunately.
*  But I think that guy wanted to die and I think he wanted to die that way.
*  He had to know.
*  What I'll say is captive wolf facilities, and I'm going to have many people who love
*  their captive wolves, but captive animal behavior and wild wolf behavior have some parallels,
*  but they're not the same.
*  And that guy doing this thing would never happen with wild wolves.
*  Right.
*  Impossible.
*  No.
*  They would never tolerate that.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  It's a weird bastardization of reality.
*  Yeah.
*  Many people, I did part of my career earlier helping to try and keep wolves out of livestock.
*  And we put out sirens and we put out blinking lights and bought raw cow hide patches and
*  raw hamburger and laced it with lithium chloride, which is a toxin that makes you violently
*  ill right away.
*  It's not going to kill you.
*  The idea being that these wolves would eat this baits wrapped with string and taste all
*  this wonderful beef burger and taste the hide and then associate that bad experience
*  of vomiting your guts out for 24 hours or whatever to the animal on the hoof out there.
*  That's a great idea for how your human brain works.
*  They just ate every bait we put out and there's piles of puke everywhere.
*  They don't think like we think.
*  Right.
*  Of course not.
*  Right.
*  And one guy Rancho was working with, we were putting out the baits, whatever.
*  sirens and I did what's called fladry and fladries and they used it in Europe and places
*  like Poland to hunt wolves where you hang streamers down from fences and you start out
*  with a really wide funnel in the woods and the hunters used to drive the wolves through
*  the forest with people at the end with guns and they would see the fladry and it would
*  be quite a ways apart, like a mile or two or something.
*  And they wouldn't cross the fladry because it scared them and they get to the end and
*  it's like shooting pheasants at the end of a cornfield.
*  So people have taken that idea to try and keep wolves out of like calving pens in specific
*  areas where the livestock are confined.
*  It doesn't work well when they're out in free range.
*  And it works pretty well.
*  So I was out working with this pasture guy in northern Minnesota and he had a long skinny
*  pasture and I had out got highway blinking lights that came on at night and the fladry
*  and he was so kind.
*  He let me, this is a lot of years ago.
*  It's just this young starry eyed thing.
*  So I stopped in to visit him and I said, well I know you had a loss, you got a calf.
*  I said, have any, the wolves been back?
*  And he looked at me and he says, well no hun, they haven't been back.
*  He says, I said, do you think the blinking lights are working on your pasture?
*  He says, well, I don't know but I damn near had a plane land here last night.
*  I broke up laughing, he broke up laughing.
*  It was just like, yeah, this is a tough job.
*  Let's just have some fun here.
*  That's hilarious.
*  But again, he didn't like wolves.
*  I didn't want him killing his cows and that was a common factor to try and keep them apart.
*  What are the cons when there's pros and cons for reintroduction of wolves?
*  What do you think the cons are?
*  Like the reintroduction in Colorado, the reintroduction in Yellowstone?
*  I believe potentially a decreased human tolerance.
*  And the wolves don't have a learning curve.
*  They're taken from one place and then boop, they're popped there versus if they kind of
*  migrate, they were down, they run this gauntlet.
*  They kind of have to learn on the way to be successful to get there.
*  They have to learn to avoid livestock pans or whatever they have to learn and stay a
*  little more secretive.
*  So that's just my belief that when they're making on their own, they've been smart enough
*  to get there.
*  Whereas when you just put them there, you're going to forever have people believing they
*  don't belong there.
*  They're not native.
*  So the problem is in the perceptions of the people that are encountering the wolves or
*  they're impacted by the wolves being there.
*  I believe so.
*  Yeah.
*  And so for example, now we've got wolves in the they were put into a total of 66 wolves
*  put into Idaho and Wyoming and then another 10 were added to Wyoming from Montana.
*  But it's a very small number of wolves.
*  But now wolves have taken over Washington, Oregon, California.
*  They've made a few made it to Colorado.
*  They're trying to get into Utah.
*  You have been shot there and all those wolves came from this introduced population, some
*  from Montana, but they'll never be considered native.
*  Which is crazy because they used to be native.
*  And the wolves that were taken for the sources, like I explained earlier, they're taken from
*  an area that wolves from Glacier Park walk to.
*  They are one population, but there's a belief socially because they were put there.
*  They're not native.
*  They're Canadian super wolves.
*  I've heard the crazy stories like these wolves weigh 175 pounds and they were selected out
*  of all the wolves captured.
*  They took the ones that were the most aggressive so that when they put them on the ground,
*  they would survive everything.
*  It's like, oh my God, no, no.
*  That sounds ridiculous, but it is kind of crazy to me that if you wanted a wolf reintroduction
*  to be successful, why would you take animals that have a history of predation on cattle
*  and livestock and use those as the reintroduction wolves?
*  I think that kind of mindset or that ignorance, whether it's willful ignorance or whether
*  it's on purpose, whether it's a fuck you to the ranchers, whatever it is, that is why
*  people have this negative perception I think you're alluding to, right?
*  And I don't think it was enough you to the ranchers.
*  I think what happened was because of the ballot box initiative, the state of Colorado was
*  required by law by December 31st of 2023 to get 10 wolves or so on the ground.
*  And it took them...
*  What if they weren't successful?
*  Like if they were required by law, does someone go to jail if you're not successful in capturing
*  the wolves to put there?
*  I don't know.
*  But what I'm saying is they had a pretty limited time.
*  They spent a lot of time trying to prep people and doing committees and working with people
*  to get them prepared.
*  And they, by the time they were able to get everything in place, they were running against
*  a wall.
*  They introduced these wolves very late in the year.
*  I think it was December.
*  And the only place they could get source wolves, they got them from Oregon.
*  And that point, Oregon gave them 10 wolves.
*  Half of them, roughly half of them, happened to have some livestock experience.
*  So this time right now, they're already gearing up for the next reintroduction, this winter
*  probably.
*  They're working with British Columbia, I believe, and they're going to take wolves, presumably
*  that have not had livestock experience, and let them go.
*  Like they did with the original introductions into Yellowstone and Idaho.
*  And I really believe because of the political pressure to squeeze this into a short timeline,
*  that the people who were really pro-wolf, it was forced that they had to take the wolves
*  that they got.
*  That's what I believe.
*  I don't think it was an FU.
*  I think it was unintentional.
*  But it's like, these are the wolves you're going to get.
*  And they took them.
*  That sounds so short-sighted.
*  Well, I know.
*  But I'm not there.
*  And I'm not trying to badmouth their efforts.
*  They're under a lot of pressure.
*  Half the state wants wolves, half doesn't.
*  They're under a short timeline.
*  Oregon was the only state that offered up the wolves.
*  Wyoming said no.
*  Montana said no.
*  Everybody said no.
*  Oregon says, you can have 10 of ours.
*  Here's the 10 you're going to get.
*  Yeah.
*  I could see why they did it that way.
*  But boy, that seems like you're just adding to the problems.
*  It really does.
*  In hindsight, it does.
*  Yeah.
*  And it...
*  Yeah.
*  What are the positives about the reintroduction of wolves?
*  Because it has been successful.
*  In Colorado or in general?
*  In general, because the Colorado one is just this year, right?
*  It's timeframes.
*  See, all this stuff has to do with the timeframes, the mistakes and the rewards.
*  So the most positive pros of reintroductions is you speed up the timeframes.
*  So like if we had let wolves slowly wander down from Canada and eventually get to Yellowstone,
*  it may have taken 10 years.
*  It may have taken 50.
*  I mean, it happened in Montana pretty quickly once they hit critical mass.
*  But it took them a few years to get there and then they just started the curve.
*  But people didn't want the time window and we had presidential administration that was
*  in favor of it.
*  We had conservative congressmen that were in favor of it.
*  You had the wolf groupies in favor of it.
*  And it's just like all came together in the timeframe and the window of opportunity opened
*  about four inches and they shoved them through.
*  And Colorado mandated by citizens ballot initiatives, which is not a really great way to, I don't
*  think to do business on any bill.
*  I mean, we have bills in Montana coming up now for voting, but the timeline was short.
*  And I think if they had more options, they would have taken wolves.
*  They would have taken wolves from Wyoming or Montana for sure, because they're more
*  wild, whatever.
*  We do have depredating wolves.
*  But they kind of got down to the wire and everybody denied them except for Oregon.
*  So that's what happened.
*  The problem with that, of course, is what we're talking about with epidemiology.
*  These animals do have a learned behavior pattern that's going to be imparted on their offspring
*  as well.
*  And the surrounding community, they're going to favor that because it's a very simple way
*  to get food.
*  Pretty simple.
*  And on the other hand, they can learn new behavior like the wolves that were taken for
*  their introductions to Yellowstone.
*  They had never seen a bison, most of them.
*  And they've learned now in Yellowstone, a lot of the animals that kill are bison.
*  No kidding.
*  It's really mind-boggling to me to see a herd surround a bison and eventually wear it down
*  or kill it or find one that's injured.
*  There's an amazing painting that I'm pretty sure Rinella told me about.
*  He might even have a copy of it.
*  Or was it Remy?
*  Might have been Remy.
*  No, it was Remy, because Remy actually, he reproduced this on his television show.
*  He had a show called Apex Predator.
*  And the show Apex Predator was all like examining the behavior characteristics of Apex Predators
*  and seeing what they did.
*  One of the things that some of the Native American tribes used to do, they would take
*  a wolf skin and they would wear it, put it on their head, and they would crawl on four
*  legs, hands and knees, up into bison.
*  Yep.
*  That one.
*  So that one.
*  I've used that in my own slideshows too.
*  Isn't that amazing, that painting?
*  That's so incredible.
*  And so they would wander up towards bison, because bison, full-grown bison are not afraid
*  of a couple of wolves.
*  And they would use that as a way to get close enough, like a decoy, and sneak up and arrow
*  these bison and kill them.
*  Yep.
*  Oh, there's a lot of paintings of that.
*  That's cool.
*  So that must have been a very common thing.
*  So Remy actually reproduced this on his television show.
*  Oh, nice.
*  He actually wore a wolf skin and crawled up to these bison.
*  He did.
*  Wild bison?
*  Yeah, wild bison.
*  Yeah.
*  Where?
*  I don't know.
*  Canada?
*  I don't know where he was.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I think it was an Apex Predator bison episode.
*  There's bison in Utah too.
*  Sure, yeah.
*  Wow, I didn't know that.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And how did he do?
*  He shot one.
*  With an arrow?
*  Yeah, with an arrow.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Well, you can imagine, especially if you have a compound bow.
*  Sure.
*  I was just shooting today, very accurate.
*  I just got a new Hoyt bow.
*  It's amazing.
*  So I don't know how they do it, but they keep making these compound bows better every year.
*  But this new one's incredible.
*  And we're shooting, I was shooting super accurate up to 60 yards.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  So if you're a guy as good as Remy is, who's literally a professional hunter, and you crawl
*  close enough to bison to get him.
*  So he shot a bison and harvested it.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  But I mean, Indians did that all the time.
*  I shouldn't say Indians.
*  Native Americans.
*  Well, there's, yeah.
*  Some of them prefer to be called Indians.
*  I know.
*  In Montana.
*  Yeah, it's tricky.
*  Yeah.
*  You got to kind of like ask them.
*  You have to know.
*  What are your pronouns, sir?
*  Right, right, right.
*  So I know that there's wild bison that live in Mexico.
*  And I know that from Steve.
*  Steve Rinell actually hunted them in Mexico.
*  And yeah, in this traditional ranch, they have this incredible way of taking care of
*  it because they've never had electricity in this area.
*  It's like this whole, this long history of hundreds of years of hunting them this way.
*  So they do all these different things to dry out the meat.
*  They make these like thin cuts of meat and hang them from sticks and dry them in the
*  sun and smoke them and do all kinds of different things to the meat.
*  Really interesting.
*  But this was one of the last when they were all wiped out from or almost wiped out from
*  North America.
*  A few of them survived in Mexico.
*  So here Remy's bison on the Sonora Desert.
*  Oh, so he did it in Mexico.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  Oh, it was a coyote.
*  Okay.
*  So, but it was in Mexico.
*  So he put the pelt on and did the whole deal.
*  Making him a costume.
*  Yeah, and sewed it into his camo.
*  Huh.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a big coyote.
*  It's definitely a coyote.
*  Isn't that interesting though?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Crazy that it worked.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, the Native Americans knew it for.
*  Well for sure a buffalo or a bison is not going to be scared of a coyote.
*  No.
*  Yeah, not at all.
*  So if they see that, they're like, oh, I know.
*  And wolves too for that matter.
*  I mean, there were millions of bison on the prairies with tens of thousands of wolves.
*  If you were healthy or you protect your calf, you're fine.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Have you ever read Coyote America?
*  No.
*  Dan Flores, who was.
*  Oh, great historian.
*  Yeah, and he was one of Ronella's professors.
*  Oh wow.
*  Yeah, that's how he met him.
*  But Dan has a very interesting theory about the population of bison and why there were
*  so many.
*  He thinks it's tied into the plague and to when Europeans came across the country and
*  90 percent of Native Americans were wiped out because of disease.
*  And he thinks that's why there was millions of bison in the field, this overpopulation
*  of bison because the predators had gone away.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I think the paper is called Bison Diplomacy, Bison Ecology.
*  Is that what it's called?
*  I'm going to have to look that up.
*  Dan Flores is awesome.
*  He is.
*  Yeah.
*  So, so interesting.
*  And the book Coyote America is crazy.
*  I'm going to have to go.
*  It's so good.
*  Yeah, there it is.
*  OK, it's Bison Ecology and Bison Diplomacy, the Southern Plains from 1800 to 1850.
*  So his theory, which I think is a very valid one and it should be researched, it should
*  be at least considered, that the reason why the early European settlers did not see enormous
*  herds of bison is because the bison weren't enormous herds back then because bison have
*  a long gestation period.
*  They're fairly easy to hunt because they're very large animals.
*  You know, if you're special.
*  And they're not afraid.
*  Yeah.
*  And if you have horseback, you can get pretty close to them, shoot them with arrows, and
*  they were very effective at hunting them.
*  And particularly the Comanche lived entirely off of bison and they were right here.
*  So right here in this area, they're just nothing but bison, eating bison constantly.
*  So they probably did a really good job of keeping the population in check.
*  Then along come Europeans and their dirty diseases.
*  And you know, this is what the primary theory is what wiped out the Maya, wiped out the
*  Aztec, wiped out the people that lived in the Amazon jungle.
*  It's all European settlers and their dirty diseases.
*  And so that when that happened, then you have what's similar to no wolves in Montana and
*  you have 20,000 elk in a place that really has a carrying capacity for like, what, six
*  or?
*  What do you think was like the correct number when there was 20,000 elk there?
*  What's the correct number of elk?
*  What would be like a healthy population?
*  The food sources could.
*  I would say right now there's about 6,500, I think, elk in the northern herd.
*  We're not talking all of Yellowstone.
*  It's just this herd that's been studied where the wolves are.
*  That's where it's at now.
*  It's stabilized.
*  There's lions and people outside the park and wolves and bears, all these things.
*  And that's where it's at.
*  And that's with everything.
*  And it hasn't changed because the number of wolves too, went from zero to thirty five,
*  thirty one to one hundred and sixty, one hundred sixty five in the last ten years.
*  It's been right about one hundred wolves every year because they contain themselves by killing
*  each other and defending the resource.
*  So they're stable right now.
*  The wolves are not increasing.
*  Is that one of the main reasons how they die or the main ways they die killing each other?
*  Killing each other and trespassing.
*  People go, oh, that's awful.
*  I said, not really.
*  I mean, if you had somebody coming into your home to steal your goods, wouldn't you shoot
*  them if you had the chance or wouldn't you defend your home?
*  Like those loggers, you almost had to shoot.
*  To defend your home, right?
*  Yourself, your family.
*  The wolves do the same thing.
*  It's sort of like what's going on with the wars everywhere in the world.
*  The wolves do the same and they don't always kill the trespassers.
*  If they can catch them, they beat them up pretty bad.
*  Sometimes they kill them.
*  Sometimes you may have a benevolent pack leader that just kind of has the wolves chase it
*  off.
*  Wolf mortality, the greatest rate, I think it's like 70 plus percent, 75, is wolves killing
*  other wolves in Yellowstone Park, non-PAC members.
*  Is their action dependent upon the amount of resources that are available?
*  Like would they be more reluctant to kill a wolf if there was plenty of food for everybody?
*  Just get out of here.
*  Whereas if they were struggling, they would go, this is a real problem having this wolf
*  around.
*  So you'd have to go to the Yellowstone researchers to look at it.
*  But I would say genetic relations, if it's closely related, they're more likely to not
*  kill it.
*  And if there's abundant food, they'd be more likely to probably not kill it.
*  I think it's a combination of the two.
*  One of the things that Dan Flores talks about in Coyote America is the expansion of coyotes
*  and that the reason this took place is that coyotes were targeted by gray wolves.
*  So they had developed this ability to recognize when one of the pack had been killed, they
*  would expand their territory and the females would have more pups.
*  The coyotes or the wolves?
*  The coyotes.
*  Okay, because the wolves.
*  So the wolves were killing the coyotes.
*  This is why there's coyotes in literally every state and every city in North America now,
*  where there wasn't a hundred years ago.
*  Is that because they have this history of being persecuted by the wolves, because they
*  don't breed with wolves, but they do breed with red wolves.
*  So where you get your coy wolf is a coyote and a red wolf on the East Coast, right?
*  The animals?
*  Do they do with Mexican wolves?
*  The animal up in the Northeastern part of the U.S. is called a coy wolf and it's a coyote
*  mixed with a wolf of unknown origin, mixed with dogs.
*  And there's lots of theories out there and I'm not up on the most current theory.
*  The original wolf up there was more like the red wolf.
*  Then you get down here and down in Louisiana, Texas, Florida, there were red wolves and
*  now they're just at the alligator refuge in North Carolina.
*  But those are being bred out of almost out of existence because they're hybridizing with
*  coyotes.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah, different story.
*  But the gray wolves do not hybridize with coyotes, was his point.
*  And that this...
*  No, not hardly ever.
*  Sometimes they do?
*  Well, up in the Great Lakes, if you look at those wolves, that's where we started doing
*  wolf stuff, they look a little bit like coyote and the mitochondrial DNA shows some traces
*  of coyote, but it's very uncommon.
*  When a wolf encounters a coyote, they kill it.
*  Was interesting you were talking about on Renella's show that they don't kill foxes.
*  So they were...
*  I mean, so you get a fox, it's like 10 pounds.
*  You get a coyote, it's like 30 pounds.
*  You get a wolf, it's 90 to 100 pounds.
*  It's about three times between each step.
*  So the ones that are closest...
*  So for coyotes, the foxes are a threat.
*  They kill them.
*  For the wolves, the coyotes are a threat and they kill them.
*  But a 100 pound wolf and a 10 pound fox, it might be a nuisance and you'll let it scavenge,
*  but it's not a threat to you.
*  Right.
*  It's not going to compete with you.
*  Exactly.
*  It's not going to take out a bison.
*  So when wolves come back on the landscape, it happened up where we are, happened at Yellowstone,
*  where it's just been a coyote economy since the wolves were taken out.
*  Coyotes rule, right?
*  I love coyotes too, but I shouldn't say love.
*  I really respect them.
*  But when you have the wolves coming back and they start displacing and killing and hammering
*  on the coyotes, well, surprise, all of a sudden red fox are coming back.
*  Like where I work in the North Fork, all those early winters, we had people all winter on
*  skis tracking wolves.
*  We never saw fox tracks, never.
*  And I never caught one in a wolf trap.
*  And then as time went on and the wolves took a foothold, so to speak, a toehold in the
*  country and they started hammering the coyotes, all of a sudden there's fox, I got fox denning
*  on my property now.
*  So will coyotes target foxes?
*  Oh yeah, big time.
*  Interesting.
*  Big time.
*  So they consider them competitors?
*  Sure.
*  I mean in places...
*  Or do they eat them?
*  I don't...
*  You know what?
*  I haven't followed that.
*  I don't track that that closely.
*  But I would guess most of the time not, unless they're incredibly hungry.
*  I would guess it's a strict eliminating competitor situation.
*  I've seen...
*  I mean, you can look at the data in Yellowstone.
*  They have witnessed tons of times of wolves going up to coyote dens and digging out on
*  killing all the pups and trying to kill the parents.
*  I don't think they usually eat them.
*  I could be wrong in that, but I don't think so.
*  It's interesting because that's one of the theories about why...
*  It was originally one of the theories why coyotes killed dogs and coyotes killed cats
*  is that they're competitors.
*  But then they started eating them.
*  So I think maybe originally that was the case because again, the expansion into urban areas
*  is fairly recent.
*  Yeah.
*  And urban coyotes are not real wild...
*  They'll eat whatever they get.
*  They habitualize.
*  Totally.
*  Just like we were talking about with all those different...
*  Totally.
*  Their behavior changes.
*  Yeah.
*  It's funny how amazingly versatile coyotes are because I am starting to see wolves being
*  the same, that they're much more generous than I would have thought and that they can
*  adapt to situations pretty easily.
*  Like that wolf pack raising its pups in the subdivision.
*  Crazy.
*  It is crazy.
*  That would be so cool though.
*  Imagine if you lived there.
*  I know.
*  As long as you don't have a poodle.
*  Right.
*  Because they do eat dogs.
*  They do eat dogs.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember when every time I go up to my little cabin, I am very conscientious about not leaving
*  my dogs outside without me there.
*  Yeah.
*  I did have a big Malamute killed by a Moutain about 35 years ago.
*  Ooh.
*  It's a big dog.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't care.
*  They don't care.
*  They can get it pretty easy.
*  Moutain, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what's interesting to me is the propensity that foxes have to befriend humans.
*  Yes.
*  Very strange.
*  So this is interesting.
*  You're a voracious reader obviously.
*  Have you ever heard of the study in Russia?
*  Yes.
*  I know what you're going with.
*  With the fox.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Go ahead and explain it.
*  The book title is How to tame a fox and create a dog.
*  One of the most interesting books I've ever read.
*  This is true.
*  I'm not saying that the 400 Wolves is not true, but I doubt it.
*  But this is true science.
*  It's supported by photos.
*  That in the 50s or so, this Russian scientist was starting a study of foxes and he wanted
*  to select simply for tameness.
*  And by selecting the tamest male, female from these different fur farms, these are captive
*  fox to start with, that he would see if their morphology or their physical appearance changed.
*  So he went to fur farms and he was picking just for tameness.
*  And eventually after many years, he'd go to the fur farm and this fox would lunge at him
*  and snarl.
*  He'd leave it.
*  And they'd say, oh, this one over here in the corner.
*  He rubs against the fence when you go to the theater, he'd take that one.
*  But over years, they have photographs of these foxes and they start changing.
*  They were silver fox a lot of them instead of red and they're black and white.
*  They kind of look like border collies and they start to have tipped over ears.
*  And they got pictures of the guys in the pens.
*  One person's bent over and there's a fox standing on their back while they're putting out the
*  food bowl and the other.
*  I mean, crazy.
*  Yes.
*  So that was in a very short time that they changed the behavior, the picture.
*  Well, you're leaving out a little bit of it.
*  Go ahead.
*  One of the things that they did was whenever any of the foxes exhibit any kind of aggression,
*  they shot them.
*  Right.
*  So they only allowed the very docile, submissive foxes to.
*  Friendly.
*  But then their eyes started getting larger, their snouts started getting shorter and the
*  ears started dropping really quick.
*  I'm glad you read it because I suggest it to your friends because I'm passionate about
*  all canids, all things wild.
*  And it was one of the most amazing pieces I read because if you think about humans domesticating
*  animals, we took some kind of a primitive form of a horse and a cow and a sheep and
*  we got our breeds now.
*  For years they had bears in captivity, brown bears in Europe forever living in king's
*  castles and doing riding the bicycles in the circus and whatever.
*  But in terms of North America, of course, we've been here anywhere in the world.
*  Nobody's domesticated the African wild hunting dog.
*  Nobody's domesticated European lynx.
*  Nobody's successfully taken a wild predator and bred it long enough with heavy artificial
*  pressure by our selection, like shooting them in the head if they aren't friendly, and turned
*  it into a different animal with the exception of wolves.
*  That is really fascinating.
*  It's really fascinating.
*  Because that's never been done to tigers or mountain lions.
*  Think about how many people have tried to keep mountain lions as pets.
*  Or coyotes.
*  You keep coyotes and after 15 generations they still look like coyotes.
*  And they still behave like coyotes.
*  They do.
*  And this little thing with the fur fox, it was extraordinary artificial selection pressure
*  to see that.
*  And they did change a bit.
*  The fox has a very strange relationship to humans where that was part of the Timothy
*  Treadbone movie.
*  In the movie he had this fox that was his friend and the fox stole his hat one day and
*  ran into the den with his hat.
*  And he's like, give me my hat back.
*  And he's like chasing him.
*  But it's an adorable relationship that this fox has with people.
*  With him in fact.
*  Climbing on his tent and hanging out with him.
*  He could touch it.
*  He could pet its head.
*  I'm sure he probably can.
*  He or somebody before him had probably food conditioned it to be accepting of it.
*  Maybe.
*  But you're talking about he's up in the grizzly maze in Alaska.
*  Maybe just never seen a human.
*  Maybe.
*  But there seems to be some sort of a strange history of comfort where this animal that's
*  a 10 pound animal is comfortable around a 150 pound man for no real reason.
*  He's not giving it anything.
*  Just him being around.
*  And it would lie down in front of him and sun itself and play around him.
*  There was a weird relationship that humans have had with foxes.
*  Mr. Treadwell was not really in the bell curve on the big high point in the normal range
*  either of normal behavior.
*  Right.
*  But I've had friends that have had encountered with foxes.
*  They're really unique.
*  And they're also, they really adapt well to people.
*  They live in agricultural areas.
*  I've got them.
*  I mean we see them all the time now.
*  They're a different animal than a coyote or a wolf.
*  It's just such a strange little fella that like wants to be your friend.
*  You know?
*  Very interesting.
*  You don't see that a lot with wolves.
*  No you don't.
*  I have a fox that visits my yard because I have chickens and we have to shoo him out
*  every time he comes into the yard.
*  But they make the craziest noise.
*  They do.
*  Like I didn't know about the noise until my friend Jim Brewer who has foxes near his house
*  in New Jersey.
*  They make this crazy scream.
*  And I was like what?
*  What does it sound like?
*  And then this little guy that lives in my neighborhood does it in my yard.
*  I got a video of him in my yard going, wah!
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy.
*  I've heard it.
*  It's kind of interesting to think about the early relation of people with wolves.
*  I talk about that in A Woman Among Wolves, my book.
*  There was a couple of paleontologists or sociologists that speculated, and I can't say if their
*  theory is correct or not, but they speculated that when people were still living in caves
*  and having spears and atlatls that they would watch.
*  So people were living in a family group in a pack.
*  The wolves were living in a family group or a pack.
*  They would watch the wolves chasing through a herd of whatever animal they were at that
*  time depending on where they lived.
*  And eventually getting one tired enough or maybe it was a cripple had a bad leg.
*  They would surround it and eventually kill it.
*  Then they speculate that the humans would learn that you know what?
*  We can go up to that killed oryx or whatever they had just killed, the primitive horse,
*  and just drive those wolves away.
*  We got tools.
*  We can kill the wolves if we have to.
*  So then it changed to where maybe those wolves had come around when the animal was cornered
*  but not dead, and the humans would come in and do the final blows and drive the wolves
*  away and take what meat they wanted and then leave.
*  And the wolves could then come in and get the spoils of all the work that they had done
*  that the humans had taken.
*  And this is their theory, that there was this relationship just because it's a brutal world,
*  not synergy and not altruistic and not, oh aren't this cute?
*  Just like hey people, look at those wolves.
*  Got an animal, a camel cornered over there.
*  Let's go kill it.
*  Take what we need.
*  Wolves would come in.
*  And that sort of began potentially the process of wolves and people beginning to interact.
*  I hate to hesitate to use the word collaborate, but this is an idea.
*  It's an interesting idea also and the interesting idea sort of coincides with the idea of the
*  introduction of agriculture.
*  Yes.
*  So you have the introduction of agriculture, so you have resources that are more abundant
*  and you have more animals.
*  And so if these people lived in a resource rich environment where there was plenty of
*  meat and they didn't have to worry, you could see how maybe they would throw some scraps
*  at a cute little wolf that's near the fire.
*  There's many ideas about how dogs were.
*  And over time.
*  Right, the ones who were least afraid hung around.
*  No, I...
*  What they did with the foxes over just the course of a few generations.
*  This took a few thousand years.
*  Yeah.
*  And then people would grab one of those wolves or let them hang around and then, you know,
*  they would clean up the offal around the camp and whatever.
*  There's many ideas.
*  Of course, nobody knows.
*  But what is kind of known is the dates from DNA and carbon dating.
*  The dates at which humans were able to domesticate livestock and the dates at which humans were
*  able to domesticate dogs from wolves and domesticating dogs preceded livestock.
*  Livestock was like 11,000 years ago, roughly of all species, swine, horses, cows, whatever.
*  So was it possible that the initial domestication of wolves into dogs took place in a very game
*  rich environment where they didn't have fight over resources?
*  And no livestock.
*  No livestock.
*  Exactly.
*  Because it hadn't happened yet.
*  So there would be more opportunity potentially for these animals.
*  Again, I'm not saying it was to help each other so much, but they took advantage of
*  each other's strengths and weaknesses.
*  The wolf strength was being able to hunt, run something down until so tired that people
*  didn't do that.
*  And then people say, oh yeah, that thing's crippled over there.
*  Let's go kill it and we'll get our meat and the wolves can have the rest or whatever.
*  Was there also a consideration that during these times, this was a hunter gathering time
*  where they really didn't have a preservation of meat.
*  There was no way to store it.
*  So you had to continue to hunt and gather.
*  So if you had an abundance, you didn't think, oh, I'll stockpile this for the next few
*  months.
*  That was never even an afterthought.
*  Probably not unless it was in the tundra.
*  It was winter time.
*  They could freeze it.
*  But the relationship of, I mean, there's many dates it said about when people domesticated
*  dogs and it varies a lot.
*  But I think there's some consensus 30, 35,000 years ago.
*  Wow, was that long ago?
*  Long ago.
*  I didn't know that.
*  And you can Google it, Jamie.
*  I thought it was like 10,000.
*  No, because it happened significantly before we began domesticating livestock.
*  So what I'm saying is there wasn't a conflict based resources were abundant.
*  There wasn't protection of our livestock.
*  There wasn't this and that.
*  And eventually people took when livestock became a thing, that eventually people would
*  take a wolf like canid, a dog that we domesticated.
*  And then I find it interesting to train it to keep the wolves, their wild cousins away
*  from the livestock.
*  Talk about.
*  Wow.
*  Crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Humans are so creative with what they can do.
*  And dogs are so plastic.
*  I mean, you take a wolf and you put a lot of pressure on it and eventually you come up
*  with a golden achiever and a griffon and a poodle because they have a lot of plasticity
*  genetically, morphologically, behaviorally that I don't think a lot of the other species
*  have or would show up when we try to domesticate them.
*  That's just my theory.
*  Yeah.
*  It seems to be uniquely adaptive.
*  Yeah, totally.
*  Are you aware of the baboons that raise dogs?
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  There's baboons that take puppies and they use the puppies as guards so they keep the
*  puppies near them and they keep these dogs near them.
*  They don't kill them.
*  And the dogs like allow them to sleep so they could be alerted to any intruders.
*  The dogs bark.
*  Sounds no different than us.
*  It's bizarre to watch.
*  I mean, I haven't heard of it.
*  There's film footage of these.
*  Wow.
*  See if you can find it.
*  Yeah, that's awesome.
*  Baboons with these dogs, like drag.
*  The dog's like, what am I doing?
*  The baboon's like, get over here.
*  They don't kill it.
*  No, they use them.
*  I mean, I'm sure they probably kill a few of them.
*  They kill babies.
*  Like baboons are pretty damn ruthless.
*  I've been to Africa and I don't like baboons.
*  Scary animal because it seems like a dog monkey.
*  Like it's got a face like a dog.
*  It's a weird animal, right?
*  Because unlike any other primate, they have a completely different jaw structure.
*  Yeah, they look like a dog.
*  It's like an extended snout.
*  Very strange animal.
*  Yes, I find colorful and beautiful and creepy and all of the things.
*  I agree.
*  I'm not.
*  So here we go.
*  So these are these are dogs that are being raised.
*  They raise these feral dogs.
*  He's dragging the dog.
*  Get over here.
*  Oh my god.
*  Like they're not very kind.
*  Where is this from?
*  That's what I was trying to read on what was going on.
*  So some people think that that might not be they might not be being raised, that it's
*  some sort of play.
*  But they're in.
*  I think this is taken from a trash pit.
*  But did you see that other larger dog that was over there?
*  It was a parent.
*  It looked like a wolf.
*  Oh, he's really wailing on that puppy.
*  He's controlling it.
*  He's trying to control it.
*  So I don't sniffing his butt processing data.
*  Processing data just like our dogs.
*  And they hold on to him by the tail.
*  It's kind of crazy.
*  They drag him around.
*  If you back it up, there was a larger dog that was in the background.
*  Yeah, like that one.
*  That dog's barking.
*  So I think the theory that I remember reading was that they had figured out that if they
*  keep these dogs around, the dogs are good watchdogs.
*  Well, I'm going to have to Google that and look up the see this my first thing.
*  I'm a researcher.
*  I want to know the source.
*  I want to know what came from the new debate over it.
*  Yeah, the viral video of baboons in Saudi Arabia garbage dump led to speculation baboons
*  kidnapped puppies and keep them as pets.
*  However, some say the baboons were likely just playing with the puppies.
*  The relationship is not analogous to pet owner relationship.
*  Maybe.
*  There's a lot of weird studies on garbage dumps and bad ones.
*  Have you ever read Sapolsky's work?
*  No, I haven't.
*  Robert Sapolsky did this study on a particularly vicious.
*  Primate.
*  What was the book he wrote like 20 years ago?
*  Something primate.
*  Yeah, I've read a long ago book.
*  I haven't read currently.
*  I don't remember.
*  But the study that was fascinating was that they found that there was one contaminated
*  pile of garbage.
*  Of course, the most vicious alphas were the ones to eat first.
*  So they died and they got sick.
*  That's the one I've read.
*  A primate's memoir.
*  It's old.
*  2002.
*  They said 20 years ago.
*  Not too far off.
*  He's amazing.
*  I've had him on the podcast as well.
*  That was a fascinating book.
*  You have.
*  I'll have to look for it.
*  Super interesting guy.
*  Especially the toxoplasmosis Gandhi discussion.
*  Like the talk about the lions and the wolves.
*  Do you know about lions and wolves and toxoplasmosis?
*  What's going on?
*  So in Yellowstone, it's basically a dog eat cat world down there for the most part because
*  of packs of wolves and the lions.
*  But they have found that because the dogs are coexisting with the lions and sometimes
*  ingest or scatter their guts or anyway, they eat some part of it.
*  They get exposed.
*  They have found with now the wolves have toxoplasmosis.
*  And what happens is there is something like 11 times.
*  It's a huge amount.
*  I wish I can't.
*  Maybe Jamie can Google it.
*  More likely to be extra bold and leaders of a pack than a dog than a wolf that does not
*  have toxoplasmosis.
*  And these these wolves that have the parasite take extraordinary risks and are more likely
*  to die and lead the pack to death.
*  So in the long run, it's sort of a cat's revenge on the wolves.
*  Well one of the things, so policy 46 more times likely to become pack leaders.
*  Incredible.
*  Isn't that wild?
*  There are 11 times more likely to leave their birth packs and do so at a young age.
*  And when they do that, they're not very well set up to survive.
*  Sapolsky found out when he was doing his residence that the there's a disproportionate amount
*  of motorcycle victims that test positive for toxo.
*  So they test them and they find out this is one of the reasons why these guys are taking
*  these crazy risks.
*  Risk takers.
*  Yeah.
*  Because of toxo.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's it's really parasite from cats.
*  You know, another book you'd like to read is called Spillover.
*  Have you read that by David Quammen?
*  No, I haven't.
*  So he wrote it in I think 2017.
*  It's an older book, maybe 2012.
*  And he wrote it's a spillover from wild animals, this QAAM minion, wild animals to human populations.
*  And it starts with a horse disease in Australia that becomes some extremely viral, terrible
*  disease in humans.
*  And he actually traces back the origins of HIV.
*  And all this happened before COVID.
*  Wow.
*  And it just was so set up because COVID is the same kind of same kind of a deal.
*  But it's a fascinating book.
*  And because you got an inquisitive mind, I think you'd really enjoy it.
*  Well, COVID is not really because COVID was a part of like a lab experiment.
*  Some people don't know.
*  Yeah, they're 99 percent sure now at this point that it was OK.
*  That it was all a gain of function research that was done.
*  There's the obscuring of the data was done purposely to try to absolve guilt from the
*  people that funded the project because the project was funded and canceled during the
*  Obama administration.
*  And then when Trump came along, there was a lot of chaos, apparently, and they reignited
*  it and they did it through another health alliance.
*  It was a very sneaky about it.
*  And when grilled, they, you know, Fauci lied about whether or not it was gain of function
*  research they were doing in the first place.
*  There's a lot of various get there's emails back and forth.
*  That's beside the point.
*  Well, I'm not I'm not going to go there because we have but but natural spillovers clearly
*  real spillover documents many, many species.
*  And actually, it's fascinating.
*  Mad cow disease.
*  It's the same thing.
*  And not God is the craziest one.
*  They forced cows to eat cows.
*  Surprise.
*  You dumbass.
*  And then the pre-ons, the fact that they can exist under thousands of thousands of
*  degrees, you can't kill them.
*  So do you have CWD here yet in Texas?
*  I'm sure they do. I'm sure they do.
*  It's not ubiquitous.
*  But I think there have been see if there's been cases of CWD.
*  And I want to get to this before I forget.
*  So the point of the Sapolsky thing was that what Sapolsky observed when these super
*  aggressive baboons ate all of the garbage that the garbage was contaminated, they
*  died. So all the aggressive ones died and they turned into this utopian society.
*  So yes.
*  And so they're all they started grooming each other more.
*  The males weren't aggressive anymore.
*  The females didn't suffer the wrath of the males.
*  And they were like hippie baboons.
*  And it lasted for a long time.
*  And I think they eventually reverted back to the same sort of typical aggressive alpha
*  male behavior as being the primary leaders of the groups.
*  But for a long time, they existed in this very strange, atypical environment where
*  kind baboons were like taking care of each other.
*  Well, it'll be really interesting with with the resources of the Yellowstone researchers
*  to do amazing stuff to see what the long range outcome is from this realization that, you
*  know, they're 46 more time likely more times to be a leader of the pack.
*  And what do these risk taking behaviors entail?
*  I'm really excited to follow this course.
*  And how many of them unfortunately get hit by cars because of this?
*  And wasn't the first ever released mountain lion or a wolf rather that got killed, killed
*  by a car?
*  The first one, my understanding, the first one in Yellowstone that released wolf, the
*  first mortality of a wolf was getting hit by a UPS truck.
*  Crazy.
*  I just feel kind of bad for the driver.
*  Shouldn't laugh. I mean, there's a dead wolf.
*  Imagine you're that poor driver.
*  Oh, I was like, oh my God, you couldn't hit the brakes.
*  I know.
*  Yeah, it's horrible.
*  Anyway, but it's just it's so fascinating that this toxoplasmosis, it could come.
*  I mean, it can implode the population.
*  Yeah, who knows?
*  So they might make terrible decisions.
*  How prevalent is it in humans?
*  I don't know.
*  Oh, it's usually prevalent in France at one point in time.
*  There was 50 percent of the population had toxo.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. And large populations of people in both Latin America, South America, places
*  where there's a lot of feral cats.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a huge instance of it.
*  Not only that, there's a disproportionate amount of people that have toxoplasmosis or
*  in countries that have toxoplasmosis that have successful soccer teams.
*  And they don't know if it's just because a lot of poor people.
*  That's the best way out.
*  Become really good at soccer.
*  Soccer is really common because everybody plays it.
*  You know, they don't know.
*  But it might be that it makes you more aggressive.
*  It makes you more you're more interested in taking risks and a little reckless.
*  And if you're a soccer player, I can probably help you to be like, ah, just go for it and
*  get crazy, more aggressive and less tentative.
*  Right. Right.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's the whole interface between humans and wildlife is becoming a more and more popular
*  field. And if I was young and could do my career over, I wouldn't I wouldn't go into that
*  because it's really crazy.
*  The CWD.
*  So that when wolves encountered first encountered parvovirus and distemper from came from
*  people and dogs going into parks and camping and dogs pooping and the disease came into
*  being in the 80s.
*  We started documenting it in Glacier and the first year that I was catching wolves and
*  we took blood samples that the the they're off the chart and their immune response antibodies
*  to that particular disease.
*  And we had most of our pups all die that year.
*  Wow.
*  Boom like that. And people don't think about, yeah, I got my little doxen up at, you know,
*  McDonald Lake and he pooped and you don't pick it up and the wolves get it.
*  But the same thing happened in Yellowstone and they have certain years where they have
*  horrible pup survival.
*  It's called recruitment.
*  They don't make it into the fall.
*  But the other thing of interest.
*  So they've been learning by studying coat colors of wolves in Yellowstone that genetically,
*  the ones who carry the gene for the black coat color, they have a different disease
*  resistance to those diseases than the gray wolf.
*  Interesting.
*  Maybe Jamie could look that up.
*  At certain times when the disease prevalence is higher, the wolves will select a mate of
*  a certain color because their genetics prove to be an asset to the survival of those pups.
*  It's crazy.
*  Do the ones with the darker coats, do they are, do they originate from denser forests?
*  So this is they also been looking at that.
*  So when I first came to Montana, many of the wolves were black and now it's probably 50,
*  50 or less.
*  In Minnesota, the original Midwestern wolves were gray and now they've got black color
*  genes and there are changes with the population density.
*  But what I learned to my best knowledge, it's a it's a K.
*  locus gene and they think that when people domesticated dogs from wolves and we took the
*  wolves into captivity, we mutated, they had mutations that we helped survive.
*  That gene for black color coat was from dogs and then dogs got bred a little bit into the
*  wolves occasionally and that coat is from a dog.
*  Interesting.
*  Doesn't mean that the animals out there that are black are hybrids.
*  I'm just saying it goes back thousands of years.
*  So the earliest descriptions of wolves, did they describe them?
*  Like, what is the earliest known, like written human history of wolves?
*  Did they describe them in a particular color?
*  Oh, boy, you know what?
*  I haven't gone.
*  I mean, if you look at Romulus and Remus, those are gray wolves in Rome.
*  Right.
*  I don't know.
*  You know, I'm not I'm not a paleontologist.
*  The thought would I was just getting to, like if you're thinking about a place like the
*  Pacific Northwest, for example, you have dense rainforest, it would probably be a
*  benefit to be darker.
*  You could hide a little bit.
*  That's the idea, like having Arctic wolves being white.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  But it's the calocus for the black color gene.
*  And it depends on if they're homozygous or heterozygous.
*  And one is here you go.
*  One of the earliest written references to black wolves occurs in the Babylonian epic.
*  Oh, it's in Gilgamesh.
*  So that's six thousand years ago.
*  The titular character rejects the sexual advances of the goddess Ishtar, reminding
*  her that she had transformed a previous lover, a shepherd into a wolf, thus turning
*  him into the very animal that his flocks must be protected against.
*  Well, heavy.
*  It is heavy.
*  I don't have to know what the root of that story is.
*  Huh?
*  Yeah.
*  So that's so fascinating.
*  Here you go.
*  Yeah, this would be a disease outbreak select for mate choice and coat color and wolf.
*  So all dogs come from wolves.
*  So you have wolves, wolves get domesticated into dogs.
*  Then some dogs reintroduce their genes into interbreeding with wolves.
*  And somehow or another, this black coat color comes into play.
*  Yes.
*  Wild.
*  It is literally.
*  And I suspect from people living in northern latitudes, the Inuits and the Native
*  Americans throughout Russia and across the North, you know, they kept dogs too.
*  And they bred them to wolves and make better sled dogs.
*  But an early reference told me that the dog native to North America was brought over here.
*  There wasn't the Native Americans didn't have dogs here thousands and thousands of years ago.
*  That's what I've been reading.
*  Well, one of the things that I learned from.
*  Part by Europeans.
*  Yeah, that's so crazy.
*  That's that's one of the things that Dan Flores was talking about was that horses came from here.
*  But then they were all they all died off.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  They don't know exactly why.
*  But probably during that mass extinction event where 65 percent of all the megafauna died.
*  And then the Europeans reintroduce horses.
*  And so the Native Americans initially didn't have horses.
*  And then some were really good at it.
*  And those are the ones that thrive like the Comanche.
*  The Spaniards brought horses in 1500s.
*  And that's how they got their horses.
*  But before that.
*  The horses came from here originally.
*  Even the horses in Africa, even zebras originated, genetically originated in the North
*  American continent.
*  I didn't know that.
*  What the hell?
*  I didn't know that.
*  No, it's crazy.
*  Zebras too?
*  Yeah.
*  Zebras.
*  How nuts.
*  That is nuts.
*  Well, we also have an animal, the pronghorn antelope.
*  Yes.
*  That is a prehistoric animal.
*  It's only.
*  Yeah, it's only here.
*  It should not be here.
*  And the only reason why it's here and the reason why it's so fast.
*  Let's say something about the.
*  I don't know.
*  It gets really deep.
*  The dark codes.
*  The K locus and codes has something to do with them having canine distemper virus.
*  That they are they're immune, more immune to respiratory infections.
*  So anyway, yeah.
*  And then the other thing.
*  Which they probably got from dogs.
*  Yes, probably.
*  Distemper.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I don't know how long distemper goes back.
*  The other thing with the pronghorn.
*  I mean, I just came from hunting wolves.
*  We're seeing, I mean, hunting birds.
*  We were seeing pronghorn everywhere.
*  Antelope.
*  Yeah.
*  I love them, but they're really prehistoric.
*  And do you know, do you know why they run at 60 miles an hour?
*  Because we used to have a North American cheetah.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  The cheetahs whittled the limbs of the antelope.
*  It was that what?
*  Yeah.
*  That's why they're so fast.
*  That's why they're so much faster than any predator in North America.
*  They got to be 60 miles an hour to run a cheetah.
*  And that wolves not there.
*  And they're still here and the cheetahs are gone.
*  But they're one of the very few of those weird animals like the North American lion.
*  Like all these different like there was a North American lion that is way bigger than the African lion.
*  I've read that.
*  I mean, I mean, I would love to paleontologist.
*  There's so many things I would like to do again and do over.
*  There's a lot of interesting things in this world and we're still just learning.
*  We still have to listen to people, experts and do a lot of reading and think for ourselves.
*  Well, thanks to you, we know a lot more about wolves.
*  Thanks.
*  I really appreciate you being here.
*  The book is A Woman Amongst Wolves, My Journey Through 40 Years of Wolf Recovery.
*  Yep.
*  Diane Boyd.
*  Can I read you just a 30 second introductory paragraph?
*  Sure.
*  That'll give you and your readers a flavor of what it's about.
*  So it's a memoir.
*  It's all real.
*  It's not a forward introduction.
*  Here we go.
*  OK, see if I can see it.
*  Oh, do you need glasses?
*  I got glasses.
*  OK.
*  Sorry.
*  Should have had them ready.
*  No worries. No worries. Hang on.
*  Can I ask you before you do that?
*  Yes. Are you going to read the audiobook?
*  No.
*  No.
*  There's a story there, too.
*  Diane.
*  We can talk about that.
*  OK.
*  Let's just be 30 seconds.
*  OK.
*  My pickup banged and rattled along the pothole inside road in the northwest corner
*  of Glacier National Park. Boxes of wolf traps and jars of bait slid across the truck bed.
*  I was in a hurry.
*  My mind focused on the wolf caught in a trap somewhere ahead in the lodgepole pine forest.
*  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed motion in my rearview mirror.
*  I looked up to catch the glassy reflection of vivid yellow eyes framed by a wolf's
*  black face looking over my shoulder from the back seat.
*  How did I get here?
*  Wow.
*  That's the opening for my book.
*  It's not a tiger.
*  But still.
*  So you asked me about.
*  What did I ask you about? Oh, the audiobook.
*  So the audiobook.
*  So when I signed my contract, this is my debut book, A Woman Among Wolves.
*  I've not written a book.
*  I've published scores of scientific articles, but not a book.
*  I signed the contract and I love working with Greystone.
*  They're a fantastic publisher.
*  Just a standard contract.
*  I signed away the rights for movie, audio, etc., etc.
*  But I get a share of the royalties and stuff.
*  So when somebody bought the bid on and bought the media rights for audiobooks
*  months before it was produced and and I didn't hear about it for a while.
*  And by the time I'd heard about it,
*  they had just started producing it.
*  And I said, well, I'd like to read for it.
*  I sent off an audio tape of my voice and
*  looks like they would need to do a bunch of polishing.
*  And it was almost September and they would I would be recording for weeks.
*  It takes like what kind of polishing,
*  annunciation and I don't know how to teach you how to say it differently.
*  I mean, I think I'm a pretty fair speaker.
*  But just anyway, it would take some training.
*  And then it was more important.
*  We take up so much time.
*  It takes like 80 hours to produce an eight hour audio.
*  The authentic version of this book is going to be in your voice.
*  Maybe when the rights expire, but I maybe they would just listen to this
*  podcast and just try it. I would love it.
*  It's not that expensive to get you in a booth for a couple of weeks.
*  They hired a professional actress.
*  The other thing was this happened just before bird hunting season opened in
*  Montana. Sorry, I get it.
*  Sorry, I really do.
*  I'm precious. Steve Rinella said the same thing.
*  Like you made a big mistake.
*  Dianna's like, I kind of didn't have options.
*  Well, either way, I'm sure it's awesome.
*  And I really appreciate you being here.
*  It was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it.
*  It's been a blast, Joe.
*  Thank you so much for having me as a guest.
*  You just treated me royally.
*  This has been wonderful.
*  I'm glad you had fun. Thank you very much.
*  Thank you. All right. Bye, everybody. Bye.
