# Joe Rogan Experience #1887 - Maynard James Keenan
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5.72s)]
*  Do you ever sauna? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10.16s)]
*  Do you do that? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=12.56s)]
*  I have a sauna, yeah. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=14.56s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=15.56s)]
*  Do you use it? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=16.56s)]
*  Well, it had, initially it had issues because it was like a janky ass actual heater that [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=17.56s)]
*  died and we had to try to get another. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=25.12s)]
*  Swap it out? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=27.36s)]
*  We had to try to get another one. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=28.36s)]
*  They'd like, no luck with that company. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=29.36s)]
*  So we just, it's like, oh, that company doesn't exist anymore. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=30.88s)]
*  So had to get a different one in there, but it's fine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=34.0s)]
*  We just got done putting a bunch of the oil on it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  Sauna oil, it's kind of, because Arizona, the sun just like- [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  Cooks everything? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=45.04s)]
*  Cooks the fucking wood. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=46.04s)]
*  So there's like, it was cracking and spaces. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  The real hardcore folks, they use the wood fired sauna. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=50.0s)]
*  Old school, like you're cooking pizza. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=54.68s)]
*  Well, they can do that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=55.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=56.68s)]
*  They sell those. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=58.0s)]
*  I'm like, that seems like a lot of work. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=59.0s)]
*  Plus you got to kill trees. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=60.8s)]
*  Yeah, we, you know, so we, you know, we use it quite a bit actually when it was running. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=62.76s)]
*  But then like I was on the road and then harvest, we didn't bother with it until just now we [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=69.76s)]
*  got it back running. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  It's so good for you, man. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=75.36s)]
*  So good. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  I just got out. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  I do it after every workout. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  It's like religious. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=80.4s)]
*  I make sure I get in there right afterwards. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=81.4s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=83.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=84.2s)]
*  You're training hard there, fella. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=85.2s)]
*  Well, John Donahue teaching you find your points of triangles. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=87.72s)]
*  That was fun to watch. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=91.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=92.92s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's hard on, as you, I just discussed this before, being on the road is, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=93.92s)]
*  it's hard to find consistent training. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=101.2s)]
*  Consistent training is your gym, that instructor, your city, your drive back and forth to your [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=103.72s)]
*  house doing two classes a day, maybe if you can, you know, like that kind of thing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=108.4s)]
*  But like the road is like inconsistent. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=112.48s)]
*  So the only consistency I can, I can really rely on is picking a particular subject and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=115.0s)]
*  going to people that I know that know how to do it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=122.14s)]
*  Rather than allowing them to go, Hey, I got this cool thing where you go upside down and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=126.08s)]
*  stand on your head and do a backflip and like buggy choke. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=130.24s)]
*  Don't please, I don't, I'm 58. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=134.68s)]
*  Please don't try to tell me what a buggy choke is right now. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=136.6s)]
*  You can't do a buggy choke? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=139.12s)]
*  I might someday, but right now I just want to fucking get the triangles right. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=140.16s)]
*  Buggy choke is a good thing to learn. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I want to learn it, but like I got, it's, let me, let me learn it when I'm going [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=146.28s)]
*  to spend three weeks on it and focused on it with somebody who understands the details, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  somebody who also understands the counters. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=156.12s)]
*  Because the counters end up being as important as understanding the actual thing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=159.56s)]
*  Just somebody caught a buggy choke recently in MMA, I think it was in Bellator and the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  dude picked him up and slammed him. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=168.36s)]
*  And he's out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=170.12s)]
*  Yeah, he got fucked up and then he beat the shit out of him. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=171.12s)]
*  I was like, yeah, that makes sense. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=173.52s)]
*  Because it's like, you really are committed to that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  You've attached yourself to the person and that they're big and strong and can drop you [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=177.4s)]
*  on some, a surface. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  You just don't have options like you do with a triangle. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=183.0s)]
*  You know, like if someone picks you up with a triangle, you drop down to the leg, you [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=185.28s)]
*  let go. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=189.12s)]
*  Like when you're in a buggy choke, you're kind of committed, I think. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=193.88s)]
*  Maybe I should talk to like the Rotolo. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=194.52s)]
*  Yeah, this is it right here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  This is not, this is not it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  This is a different one. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=198.84s)]
*  But people are getting these left and right now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  Someone pulled one off in the UFC the other day and people didn't even know what the fuck [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=204.0s)]
*  it was. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=208.24s)]
*  I had to kind of explain it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=208.96s)]
*  I'm like, this is so fascinating that this is a technique that is, you know, for Jiu-Jitsu, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  it's been around for like a year or so. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=215.56s)]
*  He's out cold. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=217.08s)]
*  For Jiu-Jitsu, it's been around for years rather. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=219.4s)]
*  But for MMA, it's just just starting to be applied. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=222.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  But the beautiful thing about, especially that high level of MMA, is that somebody's going [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  to figure out how to how to counter it or prevent it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=232.56s)]
*  And then then it's then it's it's gone. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=237.36s)]
*  I mean, for a while, all of a sudden, people were catching the Von Flu. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, people are like, no, no, I'm gonna we're going to counter that now. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=244.28s)]
*  But then every now and then somebody catches one. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=247.16s)]
*  OSP is the master. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=249.96s)]
*  He's the best at it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=251.52s)]
*  He's caught more of them than Von Flu. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  Von Flu, I think, invented it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=254.08s)]
*  But OSP, I think, has more than anybody. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=256.12s)]
*  He gets it all the time. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=258.52s)]
*  It's like it's a natural instinct when someone takes you down to hang on to that guillotine. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=259.56s)]
*  You just want to have some sort of control over him. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=264.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, that person shifts weight and they're on top of you sideways. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=266.12s)]
*  You're like, oh, shit. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=269.28s)]
*  Then your arm is trapped. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=270.24s)]
*  Good night. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=271.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's a nasty joke. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=272.32s)]
*  There's this Jiu-Jitsu is so beautiful. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=273.4s)]
*  It's so cool watching you guys today, like watching Donaher. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=275.79999999999995s)]
*  Like I learned something that position of the knee to the ear. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  Like I didn't know that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=283.56s)]
*  I kind of did it anyway. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  But watching the like, he's so good at pointing out the finer details. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=287.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=294.12s)]
*  You know, he's just such a master. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=294.84s)]
*  What a fucking interesting person he is. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=297.32s)]
*  There's no John Donaher's out there. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=299.56s)]
*  No. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  Like if you said, I want a guy who was a professor of philosophy at Columbia University, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=301.96s)]
*  who is a genius, who fell in love with Jiu-Jitsu and is dedicated to it so much so that he [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=307.84s)]
*  walks around with a rash guard every day. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=314.56s)]
*  He doesn't even have Franklin clothes. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=315.88s)]
*  I just, I just, I, you know, I was just kidding myself. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=317.68s)]
*  Like, so John, are we going to do gi or no gi? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=319.84s)]
*  Nah. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=322.64s)]
*  I think he abandoned the gi a long time ago, right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=324.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=326.24s)]
*  He's like, no gi. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=326.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you can do, the good thing about doing the gi is you must be defensively [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=329.28s)]
*  responsible because you can't get out of stuff. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=334.88s)]
*  You can't just power out of things. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=337.28s)]
*  You know, like there's certain techniques that you just, you know, when you get [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=339.68s)]
*  trapped in them, you really have to mind your P's and Q's when you get out. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=343.44s)]
*  If you have a gi. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=347.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=348.32s)]
*  And you know, I like, I like training both because I like kind of training my mind to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=348.96s)]
*  not rely on the gi, but then when it's, when there's something like a lapel or a, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=353.76s)]
*  you know, a jacket or a gi available, then I've trained how to deal with that piece of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=359.2s)]
*  fabric that's your now tool for you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=365.88s)]
*  Well, I got very fortunate that I learned gi from John Jock Machado and John Jock [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=367.88s)]
*  Machado only has one hand, his left hand. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=372.28s)]
*  He only has a thumb. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=374.55999999999995s)]
*  So John Jock's game was always over hooks and under hooks and clinch. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=375.47999999999996s)]
*  And you know, that's why he was so successful in Abu Dhabi in the early days, because [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=380.76s)]
*  it, all of his strategy completely applied to no gi, you know? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=385.4s)]
*  And so I sort of, when I was training with gi with John Jock and no gi with Eddie [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  Bravo, I would do the same things. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=396.2s)]
*  I would just have to be more responsible defensively. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  When I train with the gi, you just can't explode. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=402.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=405.32s)]
*  You know, I got back problems. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  I probably shouldn't train as much gi anyway, cause guys get a hold of it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=407.64s)]
*  And then you're, you're dealing with lower back issues. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=410.88s)]
*  Do you have back problems? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  What kind of back problems you got? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=414.88s)]
*  I just lower back stuff. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=416.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=417.67999999999995s)]
*  Trying to do all the, tried every, uh, it's just age and beat, beat down and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  travel and, you know, like on the bus, trying to describe, I was just trying to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  describe bus life to your guys out there. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=428.35999999999996s)]
*  Like, you know, it's, you're sleeping in kind of a coffin. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=430.08s)]
*  So it's kind of weird, you know, you can't really sit up cause there's a, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  there's something above your head. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  How much time do you spend on the bus? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=439.28s)]
*  Well, between every gig, unless there's a day off. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=441.24s)]
*  So, you know, we're doing two on three on and you're, so you're sleeping on the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=444.32s)]
*  bus, but it's like, imagine sleeping and then four people on each corner of your [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=447.64s)]
*  bed every 45 minutes, just shaking it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=453.28s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=457.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  So you're like, you're trying to get a solid seven, eight hours sleep. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=459.15999999999997s)]
*  You end up having to get 11 hours of sleep because three or four of that is [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=462.24s)]
*  you waking up in the middle of the night. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=465.8s)]
*  Cause you have bumps, bad roads, you know, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=467.4s)]
*  So what do you do? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  You have the driver drive you in the middle of the night? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=472.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=474.56s)]
*  So after the show, you're in the bus and you're going to the next city. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=474.76s)]
*  And, you know, depending on the, depending on the drive, if it's, you [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=478.0s)]
*  know, four hours, six hours, eight hours, nine hours. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=480.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=484.92s)]
*  I have friends who do that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=485.08s)]
*  Like Burt Kreischer does that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=485.92s)]
*  That's his thing. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=487.28s)]
*  He loves tours and buses. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=488.2s)]
*  I don't love it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=492.0s)]
*  I enjoy performing the songs. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=493.52000000000004s)]
*  The travel part is the most difficult part. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=496.56s)]
*  And then, you know, so you're, you're in air conditioned, uh, scenarios. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=498.64000000000004s)]
*  So you're getting a little dehydrated. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=503.52000000000004s)]
*  You're trying to have to hydrate a little bit more than you normally would. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=505.32s)]
*  And you're having to perform that other, that night. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=508.36s)]
*  So training is, can be difficult on the road. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=510.84000000000003s)]
*  So try to do where I know, do whatever I can. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=514.48s)]
*  To get training in. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=518.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=519.36s)]
*  I admire people that like just hit gyms, like random gyms, just show up at [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=519.5999999999999s)]
*  places when they're on the road. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=524.36s)]
*  Like that's a bold move. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=526.4s)]
*  Never know who you're going to train with. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=528.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=529.88s)]
*  No. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=530.28s)]
*  And that's, and I'm, I'm a, I'm a pussy that way for sure. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=530.52s)]
*  I, I, people that I know, I have the mats, they come to me, or if it's, if I'm [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=533.8399999999999s)]
*  going to a place, it's because I know the person. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=539.64s)]
*  Do you weight train at all? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=541.8s)]
*  Not much. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=543.56s)]
*  I used to a little bit. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  Um, but. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  It's really good for preventing injuries. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=545.88s)]
*  Like when you're talking about your lower back situation, I'll show you some stuff. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=547.68s)]
*  Some of the equipment we have out there afterwards. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=551.52s)]
*  Is it, um, like kettlebell stuff? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=553.56s)]
*  Kettlebell stuff's great, but for the lower back, there's a machine called [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=556.56s)]
*  the reverse hyper that we have out there. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=559.4799999999999s)]
*  That's phenomenal because it decompresses your back and it also strengthens [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=561.8s)]
*  all the muscles around it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=565.64s)]
*  It was invented by Louie Simmons, who's this, uh, genius that's Louie right there. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=567.64s)]
*  Rest in peace. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=572.1999999999999s)]
*  Hello. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=573.4s)]
*  He has left us and gone on to the next stage of existence. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=573.88s)]
*  But that machine he developed because, um, Louie was like a world famous power [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=576.96s)]
*  lifter and his, um, his back got fucked and they told him to get his back fused [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  because it was compressed. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=586.12s)]
*  And so he figured out a way to decompress the spine with active decompression. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  So that thing, as it swings down and you'll, you'll feel it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=591.72s)]
*  I'll show it to you afterwards. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=595.2800000000001s)]
*  When we go into the gym, that, that thing decompresses your spine on the down swing. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=596.6800000000001s)]
*  And then on the upswing, it actually strengthens the muscles around the back. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=601.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=604.48s)]
*  Anybody that has the room for it and has like some issues with their lower back, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  even if you don't have issues, if you don't want to ever have issues, I can't [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=609.4s)]
*  recommend that machine enough. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=612.64s)]
*  It's phenomenal for your back. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=614.4s)]
*  I will, I will take that advice. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=616.5999999999999s)]
*  I just feel like when you get to our age, you must weight train. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=617.8399999999999s)]
*  It just, I don't think it's an if, and, or, but I think it's, you have to do it [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=621.0s)]
*  because you otherwise you lose muscle density, you lose bone density, you know, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=624.9599999999999s)]
*  we're deteriorating. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=629.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=631.4s)]
*  Father time wants to fuck us over and grind us into dust. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=632.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=636.4799999999999s)]
*  And you know, that's, and I, this is me making excuses, but you know, there's [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=637.64s)]
*  a lot going on with the winery. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=642.7199999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=644.8s)]
*  So even just going to do jujitsu during harvest is like nearly impossible. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=645.52s)]
*  Cause you're doing 10 hour days. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=649.5999999999999s)]
*  And so I just don't have the time and you're in the sun. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=650.8399999999999s)]
*  So by the time your day is done, you're like, I need a beer and I need to go to sleep. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=653.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=657.52s)]
*  Do you take electrolytes? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=658.56s)]
*  What do you take? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=661.4399999999999s)]
*  Uh, I don't know if the Henry Aikens turned me on to this little packet of [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=662.3199999999999s)]
*  stuff that, uh, it's pretty good. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=665.4s)]
*  Uh, do you know the company that makes it? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=667.4s)]
*  There's a bunch of good ones. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  I like that. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=671.48s)]
*  So that's, that's like when I have, when we have like a couple extra interns that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=671.88s)]
*  are starting with us in the cellar, cause it's Arizona, it's a hundred, you know, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=675.36s)]
*  it might be 90 degrees, but it's 110 on the concrete, just that all that [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=679.04s)]
*  radiant heat off the, off the concrete. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=682.96s)]
*  So I make everybody have electrolyte drink to even just before we even start [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=685.12s)]
*  here, drink this now we're going to take every 15 minutes, stop, drive water, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=690.36s)]
*  drink water just cause it's a, you know, it's, it's not, it's not easy [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=695.2s)]
*  working in the sun like that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=699.6s)]
*  I think you live a fascinating life. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=700.88s)]
*  I think that the combination of the things that you do is so unique. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=703.08s)]
*  You know, the fact that you run this winery and you're very serious about it [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=707.24s)]
*  and you make this amazing wine. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  And yet also you're making this fucking killer music and you're [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=712.44s)]
*  doing the two of them together. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=716.36s)]
*  I also, I also make great pasta. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=718.76s)]
*  Yeah, you do make great pasta. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=720.92s)]
*  Make great pizza too, man. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=722.04s)]
*  That pizza place. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=724.72s)]
*  Steve makes the pizza, but yeah. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=725.84s)]
*  Well, your, your restaurant, your Austria. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=727.4s)]

*  Austria. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=732.08s)]

*  That's good. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=734.88s)]
*  Scottsdale. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=735.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=737.08s)]
*  Um, so I'm on here to talk about stuff. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=737.6800000000001s)]
*  What do you want to talk about? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=741.52s)]
*  Cause I'm doing, I'm doing stuff. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=742.52s)]
*  So, you know, full disclosure, I'm here because I'm pimping stuff that I'm selling. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=743.84s)]
*  So yeah, I'm pimping. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=748.24s)]
*  What are you pimping? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=749.8s)]
*  Pimping my wares. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=750.4s)]
*  Uh, so we did this. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=751.76s)]
*  You look like you're pimped. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=752.8s)]
*  Look at that jacket. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=753.3599999999999s)]
*  Hey, hey. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=754.4799999999999s)]
*  It's very pimpley. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=754.76s)]
*  Hey, forget about it. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=755.3199999999999s)]
*  I love that jacket. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=757.1999999999999s)]
*  Uh, so we did it when the, when the whole lockdown shit happened. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  Um, and we were, we couldn't tour. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=762.04s)]
*  Um, it sucked cause I just, I just released, uh, the tool album. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=764.7199999999999s)]
*  And then on the heels of that, I released the Pusser for existential reckoning and we [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=769.28s)]
*  couldn't tour existential reckoning. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=774.68s)]
*  So we did, we figured out, okay, screw it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=777.0799999999999s)]
*  Everybody's doing these, um, these, uh, streaming events, pay-per-views. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=779.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=783.5200000000001s)]
*  So we did one for the release of the album and for Pusser for it just made sense. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=784.24s)]
*  That was the thing that for what we do with our characters and some of our sense [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=789.72s)]
*  of humor and the nature of, you know, some of the kind of interesting, uh, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=793.64s)]
*  heady, uh, landscapes that we kind of paint with some of the songs. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=798.84s)]
*  It's just that the really interesting format for us and everybody in the band, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=802.88s)]
*  uh, this is a great, this is a good thing for us. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=807.24s)]
*  So we did another one. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=809.5600000000001s)]
*  We did, um, Billy Dee and the Hall of Feathered Servants was all of the Money [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=810.72s)]
*  Shot album and all the luchador stuff, uh, that we've shot at the Mayan theater. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=814.52s)]
*  We released that one. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=819.76s)]
*  So we went ahead and did this still during lockdown before we [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=821.52s)]
*  actually got back on the road. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=824.48s)]
*  Uh, we did, uh, Conditions of My Parole, the whole album called Parole Violator. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=825.6800000000001s)]
*  So it's a bunch of stuff that's got Billy Dee and Major Douche and a bunch of the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=831.0400000000001s)]
*  characters, Hilde and everything, along with everything from Conditions of My [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=834.36s)]
*  Parole. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=837.8000000000001s)]
*  And we did a bunch of the Vietz for Vagina era songs, uh, reworked them [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=839.0s)]
*  completely and shot that all in the Sunset Sound Studio in Hollywood. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=844.28s)]
*  There's a couple, there's come some bits in that one as well. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=849.5600000000001s)]
*  But those are two paper views that are coming out, um, this coming weekend, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=852.6800000000001s)]
*  Halloween weekend. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=856.6800000000001s)]
*  So. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=857.72s)]
*  And do you do these paper views off your website? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=858.2s)]
*  Well, we're going to, we're, yeah. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=860.96s)]
*  Pusser4TV.com is where they're going to live for now as, as a temporary thing. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=862.1999999999999s)]
*  Eventually we'll release them on Blu-ray and through iTunes and all that stuff. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=866.36s)]
*  There he is. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=871.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=872.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=875.8399999999999s)]
*  So it's, it's just a, it's just such a fun, when I figured out, when I figured out [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=876.04s)]
*  what it was and how we can do it and how we were like duck to water with it, which [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=880.4399999999999s)]
*  is all of us are really good with, um, just the concepts, putting it all together, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=885.0799999999999s)]
*  Matt Mitchell's an incredible, um, not only just a producer for the record and [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=890.72s)]
*  all engineer, but also his approach to figuring out how to put all these things [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=895.5600000000001s)]
*  together, uh, and our team, his, his girlfriend, Alyssa. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  You live in a fun life, dude. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=903.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=905.5600000000001s)]
*  I like what you're doing. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=906.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=910.52s)]
*  So it's just, it's just, uh, it's, I don't know, we just kind of went, uh, it's, it [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=910.64s)]
*  resonates with us, this approach of doing this thing, like the idea of like doing [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=914.76s)]
*  a, like a series, a poster for series. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=918.48s)]
*  That doesn't really, I think full concert with all the cool stuff in it. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=921.4s)]
*  Are you bandied about doing a series? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=925.6800000000001s)]
*  Have you thought about it? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=927.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=928.28s)]
*  But I think, you know, uh, uh, friends with, uh, Mark Brooks used to be a part [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=928.6800000000001s)]
*  of metalocalypse and conversations I'd had with him and various other people [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=933.04s)]
*  that have been in the involved in those things. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=936.76s)]
*  They're like, as soon as you go down that path as somebody like adult swim or [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=938.64s)]
*  comedy central and what other things, they just own that thing now. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=943.08s)]
*  So imagine like me getting in the wrong contract and now all these characters [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=945.64s)]
*  that I've developed, I can't even take these on the road now because some other [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=949.7199999999999s)]
*  douchebag, you can't do that. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=952.76s)]
*  No, we're not doing that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=954.0799999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=955.2399999999999s)]
*  What about doing it independently? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=956.2399999999999s)]
*  What about doing a series, you know, do it yourself? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=958.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, I think, I think my, my attention span, I think having being the full hour, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=961.0799999999999s)]
*  hour and change thing that makes sense doing like the small episodes and having [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=967.4s)]
*  to, to build in all those stories for an entire season and have somebody expect [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=972.0799999999999s)]
*  following through with the next season. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=977.92s)]
*  I don't think that I could, I don't think I could do that. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=979.8399999999999s)]
*  Do you, you have to kind of manage, you have so many interests. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=981.9599999999999s)]
*  You kind of have to manage your time wisely, don't you? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=984.92s)]
*  Because the vineyard, the winery requires so much focus and so much attention as [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=988.8399999999999s)]
*  does the creation of the music. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=995.12s)]
*  And I couldn't, I couldn't do with the winery, the success of the winery. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=996.4399999999999s)]
*  I couldn't do it without people like, you know, my wife and Tim White and Calvin [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=999.88s)]
*  and the various people that are involved, Aaron Weiss in kind of handling their jobs. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1004.92s)]
*  The delegation of what you guys do. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1010.8s)]
*  I have to be there to make the decisions when it comes to the winemaking. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1013.72s)]
*  I'm on the forklift. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1017.24s)]
*  I'm the one, I'm the one, you know, they're deciding what's going to go in what tank [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1018.08s)]
*  because every, everything ends up making, it changes the outcome of what's happening. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1022.52s)]
*  And that's just the approaches of when we're picking the grapes, what grapes are we [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1027.96s)]
*  planting? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1031.12s)]
*  All those things are come back to me, but the follow through, if I didn't have Jen [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1032.1599999999999s)]
*  and Tim and Calvin and Aaron and all my vineyard managers, Chris and Jesse, if I [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1037.76s)]
*  didn't have those people in place, I couldn't do it at all, at all. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1042.84s)]
*  So it's not, it's not just a matter of me organizing my time. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1047.32s)]
*  It's also about me delegating to people that I can trust to make the decision [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1052.76s)]
*  beyond the initial framework that I've set in place. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1057.3999999999999s)]
*  Now, when you make wine and you grow these grapes, the grapes vary seasonally. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1061.6s)]
*  They vary, does the flavor vary depending upon the weather conditions and what you [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1068.3999999999999s)]
*  do and don't do to the soil? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1074.9199999999998s)]
*  Like, does that mature or change over time? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1077.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1080.1599999999999s)]
*  And, you know, in generally speaking, you're trying to pick a location that the soil [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1080.28s)]
*  itself is going to express something in this way for a very, you know, forever. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1084.8799999999999s)]
*  That's going to be what that site does. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1090.32s)]
*  You're not going to... [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1092.6s)]
*  And what are the, what's the variables when it comes to the soil? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1092.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, this is a word called terroir. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1096.32s)]
*  Terroir? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1098.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1099.1599999999999s)]
*  And it's everything, everything, every, every completely untrackable thing that you [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1099.4399999999998s)]
*  could think of in terms of the levels of moisture, when that moisture hits that [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1104.56s)]
*  soil, how deep does that moisture go in, the content, the geology of the soil, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1109.1999999999998s)]
*  the, you know, the weather patterns in that area and how they shift year to year. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1115.1599999999999s)]
*  What grape, what actual clone did you plant in that spot and how that clone is [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1119.24s)]
*  going to react differently to all of those infinite variables of just the soil, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1123.52s)]
*  nevermind the infinite variables of the weather. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1128.1999999999998s)]
*  And then when you choose to pick how you choose to prune, how many clusters you [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1131.1999999999998s)]
*  decide to set on that particular vine, how you decide to train that vine is going to [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1136.04s)]
*  be a unilateral, is it going to be bilateral, is it going to be just a bush [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1141.56s)]
*  pruned, all these different variables about how you're going to do that farming. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1145.24s)]
*  That affects the outcome. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1150.04s)]
*  In general though, if there's a particular region that does well with a [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1152.04s)]
*  particular grape, like Oregon with Pinot Noir, there might be various ways that [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1157.32s)]
*  they're pruning and adjusting the, how they're, how they're training and growing [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1162.52s)]
*  that fruit. But it's generally speaking, it's going to be Pinot from Oregon. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1167.12s)]
*  It's going to, it's going to have a particular profile across that state, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1172.4399999999998s)]
*  variations from region to region, from site to site, from producer to producer. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1177.1999999999998s)]
*  But in general, it should have a signature that suggests Oregon Pinot, allegedly. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1182.0s)]
*  Allegedly. Do you follow like other types of, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1190.84s)]
*  do you follow like cigar growing or coffee growing or all these other different [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1196.24s)]
*  things that vary so much on the soil and things along those lines? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1202.0800000000002s)]
*  Coffee a little bit. We just picked up a, well it's not here yet. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1206.3600000000001s)]
*  Do you want some? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1209.8s)]
*  No, I'm good. I'm good. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1211.1200000000001s)]
*  This is good stuff. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1212.6000000000001s)]
*  I had, I've had two today, so I'm going to Yammer a little bit. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1213.68s)]
*  I like Yammering. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1217.4s)]
*  I am. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1218.28s)]
*  That's what we do. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1218.8s)]
*  I just picked up, it's not here yet. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1219.92s)]
*  We picked up a nice modern roaster. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1222.48s)]
*  So, cause once I move the Osteria that's in Cottonwood up to the new Hill project, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1225.4s)]
*  that building in Cottonwood will become a coffee roaster and breakfast brunch place. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1231.64s)]
*  So we're actually, we're actually pursuing relationships with beans and, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1238.3600000000001s)]
*  and you know, importers of coffee beans. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1243.68s)]
*  So when you do that, like I'm good friends with Evan Hafer from Black Rival Coffee [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1246.3600000000001s)]
*  and he'll travel all over the world and try out different beans and try out [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1250.6s)]
*  different things. And that's what this stuff is right here. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1255.3999999999999s)]
*  I've gotten really into it. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1258.04s)]
*  This is Black Rival? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1259.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1260.1999999999998s)]
*  Well then I gotta, yeah, I gotta. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1261.32s)]
*  Sorry brother. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1263.1999999999998s)]
*  I didn't know it was yours, brother. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1264.24s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1265.56s)]
*  Yeah, no, he's, cheers sir. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1265.9599999999998s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1267.9199999999998s)]
*  Always good to see you. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1268.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1269.56s)]
*  Evan makes some fucking phenomenal stuff. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1270.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1274.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1274.8799999999999s)]
*  So, you know, so I have my, you know, Todd Fox is basically my, my go-to guy. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1275.72s)]
*  He, he actually has, he has that eye of the tiger on those kind of things. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1281.24s)]
*  And he'll point out things. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1286.6s)]
*  Cause I'm just, dude, I'm, I'm living and I'm going and he'll go check out the [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1287.6399999999999s)]
*  difference between these Colombian beans and this Brazilian beans. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1293.52s)]
*  And I'll go, okay. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1297.28s)]
*  He'll be the one that kind of slows me down to focus on check it out. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1298.6s)]
*  You're like, you know what? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1302.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm right. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1303.36s)]
*  Like then he'll put stuff, you know, randomly we'll have some stuff. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1303.76s)]
*  He goes, what do you think of that one? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1306.4399999999998s)]
*  I go, I really like that. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1308.12s)]
*  He goes, that was, those are the Brazilian beans. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1308.9599999999998s)]
*  So, so he's starting to help me kind of identify what it is that I like in a [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1311.32s)]
*  coffee, in an approach, because I don't. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1317.7199999999998s)]
*  Like a band, I don't have to sound like Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1322.0s)]
*  I just have to sound like me and, and express the way I'm going to express. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1324.8799999999999s)]
*  So I don't need to be able to make every kind of coffee from every part of the [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1328.9199999999998s)]
*  world. I just need to figure out the ones that, that I like, because I'm kind of, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1333.9599999999998s)]
*  in a way I'm making it for me, but I'm also selling it, but I'm not selling it [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1338.36s)]
*  to everybody. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1342.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm selling it to the people that are going to like it. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1344.12s)]
*  And they're going to come to my place because that's unique. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1346.08s)]
*  I had a guy on the podcast years back, Peter Giuliano is that his name? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1348.9199999999998s)]
*  He's a, like a legitimate coffee nerd. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1353.1999999999998s)]
*  And he, we went down like a three hour rabbit hole of coffee where he explained [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1356.2800000000002s)]
*  to me all the beans initially came from Ethiopia and how their flavors changed as [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1360.7600000000002s)]
*  they moved them to South America and grew in Colombia. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1366.24s)]
*  That's an expression of terroir. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1368.7600000000002s)]
*  That just, it changes clone to weather, to soil, to grower, to roaster. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1370.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's so many rabbit holes you can go down with that. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1377.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1380.72s)]
*  Like, you know, your average large commercial facilities that have a [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1381.1999999999998s)]
*  consistent coffee, that's not great. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1385.36s)]
*  It's usually over roasted or they overheat it when they, when they do the [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1389.04s)]
*  cut cause they, cause they're just trying to cover up flaws. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1393.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1396.36s)]
*  Well, it's just like when people talk about coffee and they talk about [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1396.7199999999998s)]
*  commercial places, most of the people are buying stuff that's just, they're [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1400.28s)]
*  not really buying coffee. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1403.56s)]
*  They're buying sugar water. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1404.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1405.8799999999999s)]
*  That's got caffeine in it. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1406.1999999999998s)]
*  I was at, I went to do a, an article and a training session out at [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1408.0s)]
*  Gunsite in, in outside of, in Pauldin, Arizona. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1412.72s)]
*  It's an old school training facility. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1417.76s)]
*  And I went there early morning. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1421.08s)]
*  We're going to do this whole gun range thing. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1422.52s)]
*  And this guy named Charlie sitting at the table, he goes, you want some coffee? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1424.6s)]
*  I'm like, sure. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1429.72s)]
*  He goes, cream and sugar. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1431.08s)]
*  I normally don't, but like, it sounded like that's what he, yeah. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1432.76s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1435.24s)]
*  He goes, I asked if you wanted coffee, not pudding. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1436.0s)]
*  Fucking clotheslined me first out of the box. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1440.7600000000002s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1443.96s)]
*  Um, but I fell for it. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1445.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1447.68s)]
*  I only go black now. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1447.92s)]
*  It's been like a couple of years now. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1449.4s)]
*  I only drink black coffee. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1451.0400000000002s)]
*  I do. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1452.3200000000002s)]
*  I do a little bit of cream. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1452.7600000000002s)]
*  Uh, and I think, and I've, and I'm, I've been pretty consistent with that [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1454.24s)]
*  lately because, because I'm now I'm focusing on what beans I like. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1457.44s)]
*  And for me, I know it's going to change once I, once I've removed the cream, but [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1462.24s)]
*  that's the lens that I see the coffee through is I have to have the cream in [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1466.72s)]
*  there because that's how I'm going to drink it. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1470.44s)]
*  So I'm trying to figure out what ones I like. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1473.3600000000001s)]
*  And with that lens, I know that if I remove that, that lens is probably going [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1475.48s)]
*  to change my perception of what coffees I like. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1480.48s)]
*  It's funny that cream debate, whether or not you should put cream and coffee. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1483.1200000000001s)]
*  It's, it's an interesting thing because [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1487.44s)]
*  I think there's far bigger issues in the world to discuss. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1490.12s)]
*  There definitely are, but it's just such a funny cream alone. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1493.72s)]
*  Listen, I like it. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1497.6799999999998s)]
*  I like cream. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1498.6399999999999s)]
*  I like cream in a Kona Kona coffee. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1499.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1501.76s)]
*  I like a little cream in there, but generally I just drink it black now. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1502.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1505.84s)]
*  I'm planning trips to Hawaii because I want to establish some relationships [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1506.0s)]
*  with some Maui growers so that I can actually part, make that be part of, um, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1510.72s)]
*  what I'm doing in Arizona, but also because I get to go train with, uh, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1515.84s)]
*  Louise. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1520.36s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1521.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1521.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm a Jiu Jitsu. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1521.8799999999999s)]
*  Louise was my first instructor ever. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1522.68s)]
*  He taught me my first private lesson. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1524.44s)]
*  Really? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1525.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1526.36s)]
*  He had Hickson's. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1527.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1528.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1528.72s)]
*  On Pico. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1528.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1529.6s)]
*  In 1996. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1529.8799999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1531.92s)]
*  I must've just missed you. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1532.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1534.12s)]
*  Well, I only went there a couple of times and then I found Carlson Gracie's and I [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1534.4s)]
*  was so dumb, I didn't know I'm like, Oh, this is a different place, but it's the [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1537.8799999999999s)]
*  same name, must be the same thing. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1541.04s)]
*  And I caught Carlson Gracie's right when Vitor, when they were still calling him [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1543.6s)]
*  Victor, and he had just competed against John Hess in Hawaii. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1548.2s)]
*  That was his debut. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1554.6s)]
*  He was like 19 years old and then he was about to make his UFC debut. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1555.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1560.08s)]
*  I remember, I remember sitting behind, um, Vitor, uh, one row behind him when, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1560.24s)]
*  uh, when Silva broke his leg. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1568.08s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1571.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1572.52s)]
*  But it's like, but here's, here's Vitor's head. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1573.72s)]
*  And I'm like having to figure out how to see around this fucking [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1576.72s)]
*  brick of a head, his head is huge. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1580.96s)]
*  Well, he, when he got up to like 240 pounds, when he fought [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1584.04s)]
*  Randy Cotora, it was preposterous. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1587.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1590.32s)]
*  He was an enormous man. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1590.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1592.48s)]
*  But that, those days, like those early days of the UFC were so interesting. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1593.48s)]
*  Cause like it's, there's nothing like MMA in that regard or Jiu-Jitsu where you [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1597.6s)]
*  can go back just 25 years and you go and look at the difference between the art [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1602.68s)]
*  form then and what it is now. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1608.0s)]
*  It's just evolved and leaps and bounds. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1610.52s)]
*  It's evolved, but there's also, yeah, there's some, you know, we could, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1612.88s)]
*  we can go on for hours about it, but when I first started at Pico, it was, you [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1617.48s)]
*  could tell that there was a, you know, there was a, there was a club within the [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1621.96s)]
*  club and I was never going to have access to that information. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1626.0800000000002s)]
*  And then [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1630.68s)]
*  Oh, back then there was. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1630.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1631.88s)]
*  And then it was really weird. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1632.52s)]
*  And you're not allowed to go to somebody else's gym. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1633.6399999999999s)]
*  So I'm traveling and I'm like, I couldn't, I couldn't train with anybody. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1635.76s)]
*  I had to like, I had to wait till I got back to LA to pick it up. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1640.28s)]
*  Unless I brought somebody with me on the road to train some techniques. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1644.04s)]
*  I had no idea what the hell we were doing. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1647.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1650.28s)]
*  I was very fortunate that Jean-Jacques did not have that attitude. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1650.8799999999999s)]
*  Jean-Jacques was just go train my friend, train, train everywhere you can. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1654.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1658.32s)]
*  And he was such a great guy and he had such a loyal, a student base that he had [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1658.6799999999998s)]
*  zero concerns about people leaving him. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1664.04s)]
*  You know, his concern was just that you trained. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1666.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1668.9199999999998s)]
*  Which is very fortunate. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1669.3999999999999s)]
*  I didn't, I didn't have that because it was just such a weird at that moment. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1670.76s)]
*  What was a famine mentality in the early days? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1675.32s)]
*  There were, well, there was also lawsuits going on because like, uh, they were like [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1678.36s)]
*  the Gracies were suing other people for using the Gracie name, you know. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1683.7199999999998s)]
*  Like, uh, Orion didn't he sue Carlson? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1688.84s)]
*  I think they, they, they sued, he sued someone for using the term Gracie [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1692.4399999999998s)]
*  jujitsu, even though Carlson's last name was Gracie. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1697.56s)]
*  I don't know if it was Carlson. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1700.28s)]
*  I don't want to misrepresent it, but I know that there was some lawsuits [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1701.1599999999999s)]
*  involved because Gracie jujitsu itself became like a different thing. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1705.0s)]
*  They were calling that a different thing than just straight Brazilian jujitsu. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1709.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1712.9199999999998s)]
*  And now I think it's the op, like, I, you know, I'm not sure where it is now, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1714.08s)]
*  but whatever. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1716.9599999999998s)]
*  I give up. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1718.76s)]
*  Well, you mean that's where it becomes fascinating where a guy like John [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1719.7199999999998s)]
*  Donahue kind of like leaps to the top of this thing with just this analytical [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1722.76s)]
*  perspective that's completely free of dogma. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1728.32s)]
*  All he cares about is what is the correct way to do things. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1731.32s)]
*  It was the most effective in tried and true competition format. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1734.76s)]
*  Like this is what we've learned. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1739.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1741.8s)]
*  Without any bullshit. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1742.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1744.36s)]
*  And that, you know, that that's been great for me to be on the road [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1745.1999999999998s)]
*  training with somebody like, like John, like my friends at Easton and Denver [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1748.16s)]
*  and, you know, you know, Dave and Dan, Dan Camrio, they all have a slightly [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1753.3200000000002s)]
*  different approach to the things. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1758.44s)]
*  Some of the guys are going to be a little more self-defense oriented. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1760.68s)]
*  So they're going to be looking to check your position and make sure you [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1764.24s)]
*  can't get hit in the face. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1767.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1769.2s)]
*  But if you, but I'm a grown ass man. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1770.3600000000001s)]
*  And so you go, okay, I am playing jujitsu. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1772.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm not worried about getting it in the face. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1775.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm going to train this position to understand how to move my body. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1776.6s)]
*  Cause that's what it is. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1779.56s)]
*  It's about, it's about. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1780.36s)]
*  If at the end of the day, it is about me taking you offline and advancing, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1783.04s)]
*  but really it's about you and your self discovery and your ability to, for [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1787.04s)]
*  self control, me being able to control my body to do a thing. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1792.04s)]
*  And if you don't, if you don't have that self awareness of understanding that [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1797.6s)]
*  this isn't just you flopping around like a fish, accidentally meeting some dude [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1801.12s)]
*  in the face while you're going for a move, you're not really progressing. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1804.4s)]
*  If you don't understand that it is about your self control. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1807.8000000000002s)]
*  So, okay. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1810.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1811.92s)]
*  That's self, that's a self-defense approach to the jujitsu, but I'm also [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1812.0800000000002s)]
*  conscious enough to know, okay, I'm going to do this. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1815.6000000000001s)]
*  Like, I'm going to play around with X guard and see what happens. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1818.3600000000001s)]
*  Cause I've never done it. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1820.48s)]
*  And I want to see how that, what that is. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1821.6000000000001s)]
*  How much does that, how much does training in jujitsu help just your, your [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1823.92s)]
*  mind, the way you approach life and the way you think about things? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1828.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, it's, it's like I've mentioned before when you showed, this is the [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1832.3600000000001s)]
*  hardest thing I've ever done in my life. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1835.44s)]
*  This is not, does not come easy for me. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1836.88s)]
*  I am the perfect example of a klutzy dude who this is not, this is not [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1838.8400000000001s)]
*  natural for me to do. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1844.2s)]
*  Um, and because of that, because of that, it will forever, it was stressful. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1846.8400000000001s)]
*  And so you're activating your mind in a stressful situation and you're still [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1853.0400000000002s)]
*  getting oxygen in your blood and you're moving and you're, and you're, and [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1856.76s)]
*  you're opening up things. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1860.0s)]
*  But if some point it became more like chess instead of this, oh my [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1862.08s)]
*  God, this guy's going to tap me. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1868.16s)]
*  Well, of course he's going to tap you. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1870.12s)]
*  If you just get that in your head, like I'm going, I might lose today. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1872.92s)]
*  I'm probably going to lose today. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1876.32s)]
*  Be comfortable in that moment of understanding how to like be conscious [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1879.2s)]
*  and aware in that moment so that you can recognize the moment before you get to [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1883.0s)]
*  the moment now for next time. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1888.12s)]
*  That was, that was a weird shift for me getting to a position of like, I'm in a [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1890.96s)]
*  compromised position, but I'm going to get to a safe position within the [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1894.84s)]
*  compromised position, take a deep breath and pay attention to what he does next. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1898.24s)]
*  So that next time I can be ahead of what he does next. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1904.6s)]
*  Weird mental thing. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1908.68s)]
*  And then training enough that you could store all this data and have it [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1910.76s)]
*  accessible when these scenarios present themselves again. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1915.16s)]
*  Because again, it's about body control and understanding what your body is [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1918.32s)]
*  going to do naturally now. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1921.36s)]
*  The drilling, the drilling, the drilling. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1923.16s)]
*  I cannot stress enough the drilling in a safe environment with somebody who's [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1924.84s)]
*  not trying to tear your head off with a good training partner who's going to [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1929.24s)]
*  give you the resistance you need to be able to rep the repetition and then [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1933.1200000000001s)]
*  replicate that movement. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1938.96s)]
*  Yeah, we're talking about jujitsu, but we're not, we're talking about making pasta. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1941.6s)]
*  We're talking about making wine. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1945.76s)]
*  These are things that apply to every area of your life. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1947.8799999999999s)]
*  If you can find one that's more difficult for you than the other ones, you'll [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1951.1599999999999s)]
*  improve the things that come naturally to you by focusing on the thing that [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1955.56s)]
*  doesn't come naturally to you. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1960.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1962.0s)]
*  It's the great quote from Miyamoto Musashi. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1962.32s)]
*  Once you understand the way broadly, you can see it in all things. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1964.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1968.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1969.6s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1969.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1970.8799999999999s)]
*  That's, uh, that's the beauty of martial arts and that's the, that's the thing [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1971.9199999999998s)]
*  that's missed by people that don't practice it, that think of it as like [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1976.44s)]
*  some sort of brutal endeavor for, you know, macho brutes. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1980.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1985.92s)]
*  I mean, but you know, we know those guys. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1986.16s)]
*  They exist. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1988.48s)]
*  Yeah, they exist. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1989.1200000000001s)]
*  But they need to exercise too. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1989.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1991.52s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1992.48s)]
*  Uh, but you know, it's, I think, um, that just that finding that thing that's [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1993.16s)]
*  actually challenging you physically, mentally, spiritually helps with other [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=1999.8s)]
*  things that come along. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2005.1200000000001s)]
*  Cause there's, you know, the world's weird right now. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2006.64s)]
*  That's there's things, I don't know. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2009.28s)]
*  I feel like we're, we're helping train people to understand that the world [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2011.76s)]
*  goes through a lot of changes. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2017.4s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of stress. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2019.04s)]
*  Nobody's going to, in 90% of the people, the world are not going to agree with you. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2020.88s)]
*  And if you can get through that mentally and emotionally and spiritually to know [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2025.96s)]
*  that there's something on the other side. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2029.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2033.56s)]
*  I think things like jujitsu, things like growing food, resigning yourself to nature [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2033.84s)]
*  and having to navigate farming, those kinds of things, they start to reset you [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2041.56s)]
*  in a way where like, it's not this, not everything has to be an argument. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2045.9199999999998s)]
*  Sometimes it's you just having to navigate the fucking weather. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2050.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2053.64s)]
*  If you can get to that mindset, you get a lot more done, honestly, and you'll [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2054.36s)]
*  survive shit that some people won't because they're so focused on the petty [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2058.0s)]
*  dumb shit that they're going to miss the bigger picture. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2062.04s)]
*  I think a lot of the petty stuff is people also want you to agree with them. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2065.28s)]
*  That's not really necessary. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2069.76s)]
*  You know, so many people, they have an opinion and they feel like if they can't [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2072.4s)]
*  convince you that they're correct or they can't force their opinion on you, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2076.2000000000003s)]
*  that somehow or another invalidates their own perspective. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2081.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2084.6800000000003s)]
*  I find that, you know, going back again, we can go right back to jujitsu. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2085.36s)]
*  We know guys that are like, no, this is the only way to do this. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2088.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2091.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2091.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2092.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2092.84s)]
*  Well, I just watched this guy beat the shit out of everyone at ADCC and he's not [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2093.2000000000003s)]
*  doing the things that you're telling me that you're supposed to only do, you know? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2101.44s)]
*  And then like, this is the only way that, well, using Hickson example, Hickson says [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2106.6800000000003s)]
*  only do this, this, this, and this. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2111.28s)]
*  You never do these other things. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2112.6400000000003s)]
*  It's like, have you not watched his Valley Tuto videos? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2113.8s)]
*  He did everything the opposite of what you just said. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2118.4s)]
*  He had his nose before his toes. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2122.2000000000003s)]
*  He had like all these things that you're like, you're not supposed to do. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2123.92s)]
*  And it's like, he, you know, those things are not necessarily 100%. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2126.36s)]
*  So you have to be open-minded. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2132.0800000000004s)]
*  You have to disagree with it being one way. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2134.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2138.96s)]
*  I mean, it really is an art. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2140.44s)]
*  And then be open to hearing the way that you didn't think it was. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2141.44s)]
*  And then there's all these variables, like the size of your frame, you know, the way [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2145.88s)]
*  your body moves, whether or not you're flexible. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2150.2799999999997s)]
*  There's so many variables that will present themselves in this sort of equation of how [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2152.52s)]
*  do you express yourself on the, on the mat? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2157.08s)]
*  Now that you know, the one thing that I was talking to Donald, the guy you just met [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2160.84s)]
*  today, you know, you're, you're trying to convince a couple of friends to take a class. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2164.52s)]
*  You know, they're not very athletic, but they, you know, musician friends like, yeah, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2170.24s)]
*  just come in and take the white belt class. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2173.48s)]
*  You're in a safe environment and under getting to understand, like when you walk in the [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2175.2s)]
*  room and you see a dude shaped like you, that might not be the biggest sniper in the room. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2180.96s)]
*  It might be that geeky kid in the corner who looks like he probably works in a library. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2187.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2192.16s)]
*  Oftentimes it is. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2192.8s)]
*  And he's the one who's going to fuck you up. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2193.64s)]
*  He looks like he's like, you know, the nerd in the corner with the glasses and the goofy [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2196.28s)]
*  hair. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2199.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2200.0s)]
*  He's the guy who's going to fuck you up. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2200.52s)]
*  The nerd assassins. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2201.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2203.12s)]
*  Well, because they're analytical, you know, and jujitsu favors the analytical approach. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2203.52s)]
*  You, you analyze positions and analyze possible counters and, and traps that you can set. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2208.92s)]
*  That's why I love guys like Mikey Musumechi because he's, you know, he is, he is a [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2215.4s)]
*  fascinating fellow who I had him on the podcast. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2221.24s)]
*  He's like the smiliest assassin, thick glasses, only eats pizza and pasta and he only [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2224.4s)]
*  eats once a day, trains no bullshit, 12 hours a day. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2231.24s)]
*  He's constantly drilling and going over positions, big ass smile on his face. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2235.7599999999998s)]
*  He's multiple time world champion. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2240.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2242.52s)]
*  And he's just fucking assassinating. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2243.0s)]
*  We have a guy, a new guy at our gym, a brown belt out of Easton and he, and he has these [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2244.96s)]
*  kind of a geeky dude, tall with glasses, names Clay Wimmer. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2249.3999999999996s)]
*  He's from a malls gym in Colorado. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2253.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2255.12s)]
*  He's out of a Centennial. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2255.16s)]
*  I think he got his brown belt from Velour. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2256.68s)]
*  Uh, and when he's, when he's rolling, he's got this creepy grin on his face. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2260.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, what are you, you're creeping me out, dude. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2267.8s)]
*  Stop grinning. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2270.2400000000002s)]
*  And he's like, he's one of those backpack fuckers. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2271.4s)]
*  He gets red on your back and you're like, you're screwed. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2273.36s)]
*  And he got there. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2275.6800000000003s)]
*  You know how he got there, but he got there and he's grinning the whole time. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2276.36s)]
*  Like sometimes chewing gum. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2280.1600000000003s)]
*  You're like, are you, you're chewing, you're chewing gum and you're grinning. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2281.8s)]
*  You're creeping me out, man. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2285.4s)]
*  That's Mikey. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2286.88s)]
*  Pull up Mikey Musumechi, uh, takes Imanari's back. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2288.3199999999997s)]
*  There's a video of him. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2292.7599999999998s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2294.04s)]
*  Look, this is, he already took the back. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2294.8399999999997s)]
*  Watch how he, uh, he takes it back. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2296.72s)]
*  Go, go back a little bit of ways and you see the position. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2298.4s)]
*  So they're in a scramble and, uh, Imanari, who's like the master leg locker. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2301.88s)]
*  Watch how Mikey takes his back. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2307.24s)]
*  This is so fucking beautiful. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2308.68s)]
*  He takes him out. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2310.16s)]
*  This is Mikey on top here. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2310.7999999999997s)]
*  And this is again, this is against Imanari. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2312.24s)]
*  Look at this back take. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2313.96s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2314.96s)]
*  We got that, that, uh, neck grab. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2315.44s)]
*  Do you see how sweet that was? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2318.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2319.1200000000003s)]

*  He's amazing. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2350.84s)]
*  And it's to me that he's my, my favorite example when I show people. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2352.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2362.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2362.96s)]
*  He's just such a sweet guy too. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2364.36s)]
*  And, uh, so talented. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2366.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what I love about you, Juju. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2368.56s)]

*  You know? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2372.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2373.1600000000003s)]
*  That it's just, it's, it's an art form. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2374.2s)]
*  I mean, he might as well be playing the violin. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2376.28s)]
*  You know, he might as well be, you know, making paintings or something. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2378.6s)]
*  It's like, that's what he's doing. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2382.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2384.2s)]
*  It's a beautiful, it's yeah. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2384.4s)]
*  And like I said, it's hardest, one of the hardest things ever done in my life. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2386.2s)]
*  It's fucking hard as shit. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2389.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2390.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2391.0s)]
*  When I, that's, I, there's a bond that you have, like I hung out with a guy, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2391.24s)]
*  Richie this past weekend in London. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2396.12s)]
*  And, uh, we had that, the same sort of conversation. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2398.52s)]
*  Like he did my podcast a few years back and he said, I wanted to do your podcast. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2401.44s)]
*  Cause I knew you were a Jujitsu guy. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2404.92s)]
*  He's like, I knew we would have like very common perspectives on things. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2406.8s)]
*  Like there's a thing, if you've done it and you've gotten to like, he's a black [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2411.12s)]
*  belt on their HENZO guy, guys, he's really legit and you would never know. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2414.2000000000003s)]
*  Like he's like super unassuming guy. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2419.08s)]
*  But then you start talking to him about details and stuff. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2420.88s)]
*  Like, oh, you're fucking legit. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2423.12s)]
*  He's for real. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2424.88s)]
*  I love those guys. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2426.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2427.84s)]
*  You know, the guys that doesn't really happen anymore, but like the kind of guy [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2428.7599999999998s)]
*  that you wish you were at the end of the bar in some scenario where two dudes or [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2432.92s)]
*  one guy is just fucking with the nerd at the bar before cameras, before, you know, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2437.16s)]
*  before these, so you could actually get away, he could actually get away with it. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2442.56s)]
*  You know, like, you know, in a bar and I've like just go, Oh, this is going to be [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2445.64s)]
*  great. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2449.64s)]
*  Did you see the video of a HENZO Gracie taking some guy down on the subway? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2450.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2454.3599999999997s)]
*  Some asshole just get really shitty. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2455.0s)]
*  And you just like, my friend, you've made a big mistake. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2457.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2463.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2464.04s)]
*  Don't do that anymore. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2464.28s)]
*  It's a, it's a way of life though. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2466.6s)]
*  It really is. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2468.28s)]
*  It's a, it's a way of like making this thing so difficult that the rest of life [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2469.6s)]
*  seems maybe not less complicated, but more understandable. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2475.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2482.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2483.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2483.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2484.56s)]
*  Through that struggle of that thing, you can kind of like apply those lessons to [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2485.8s)]
*  other stuff. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2490.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2492.04s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2493.7200000000003s)]
*  I think it's, I've, over the years I've applied it to, of course, writing and [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2494.92s)]
*  putting music together. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2499.96s)]
*  That's definitely that, that struggle of like you hit a, you hit a wall, you have [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2501.6000000000004s)]
*  to navigate, you know, through a round or over. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2508.6800000000003s)]
*  When you write, do you write on your own? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2512.32s)]
*  Do you write with other people? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2516.24s)]
*  Like how do you create music? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2517.6s)]
*  Do you create music alone? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2519.36s)]
*  It's, it's like, for me it's, it's okay. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2521.08s)]
*  I'm going to train, I'm going to train jujitsu. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2524.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2526.52s)]
*  We're going to bring it back to that. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2526.72s)]
*  Cause that's, that's our, that's our, that's our, our, our base here. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2527.64s)]
*  Uh, if I'm, you know, if I'm going to train with somebody, every different, every [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2531.96s)]
*  body type is going to be a different thing. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2537.72s)]
*  And I can't just, you know how it is. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2540.08s)]
*  If you, if you're just going to force your will on some other dude, then it's [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2542.12s)]
*  just two idiots trying to force their will on each other and you're going to gas out. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2546.36s)]
*  You have to see what this thing is and this person, how they're approaching you. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2550.7999999999997s)]
*  Are they approaching you standing? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2555.68s)]
*  Are they butt scooting? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2556.88s)]
*  Are they going to, you know, are they going to, you know, whatever they're going to do. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2558.0s)]
*  Each song and every riff or whatever is a reaction to what I'm seeing or hearing. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2561.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2568.36s)]
*  So I'm not just going to come in with a lyric and come over the line on top of [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2569.64s)]
*  some kind of rhythm or a melody. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2573.16s)]
*  I have to pay attention to what's in front of me and, and work around that thing. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2575.24s)]
*  And listen to it and pay attention to it and drill. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2581.56s)]
*  So how does this process start? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2584.9199999999996s)]
*  Like say you have a blank slate. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2586.72s)]
*  Blank slate. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2589.3199999999997s)]
*  So for me, there's not really a blank slate. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2589.96s)]
*  It's me going to, maybe it's me going to, um, Matt and going, okay, just in [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2591.72s)]
*  general, uh, I'd like to see what we can do with, there's some sounds that I [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2598.4s)]
*  heard on this, you know, maybe as a movie soundtrack, maybe it was a record, you [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2604.76s)]
*  know, maybe I'm picking out like mandolin or, you know, some kind of a particular [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2610.0s)]
*  pedal from a guitar or a film that has like a Rykuter riff going through it or [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2613.96s)]
*  something, a vibe, and maybe Matt has picked up in the case of existential [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2619.1600000000003s)]
*  reckoning, he picked up a bunch of amazing old synths like Fairlight and [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2624.44s)]
*  Synclavier and all this kind of cool shit that that's in a way it's. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2628.76s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2633.12s)]
*  Synths? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2633.6s)]
*  Synthesizers. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2634.32s)]
*  Synthesizers. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2635.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2635.68s)]
*  So old school, like, you know, craft work, you know, um, yes, uh, old like, you [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2635.8s)]
*  know, Michael's, Michael Jackson's like, that familiar sound, but from a very [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2640.36s)]
*  specific thing and you can manipulate those sounds to a point, but they're [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2647.96s)]
*  kind of, you're kind of boxed in on the, what those things can do in some cases, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2653.64s)]
*  like the Fairlight's very, it's going to give you a very specific sound. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2658.56s)]
*  Well, now there's the framework and he'll come up with a melody or a thing [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2662.8799999999997s)]
*  and he'll throw it to me and I'll just drill, drill, drill that thing into my [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2666.96s)]
*  head, driving around with it in my car, truck, you know, putting headphones on, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2672.4s)]
*  on the plane and just listen in the cellar. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2677.72s)]
*  I'll put it on while I'm working on stuff. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2680.92s)]
*  Just to, just to put that thing on loop and drill it into my head of what it is [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2683.64s)]
*  so that I can figure out how to go through around or over this thing, work [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2688.7599999999998s)]
*  with it, work against it intentionally. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2694.44s)]
*  So it's, it's a, it's a mathematical three-dimensional geometric puzzle. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2697.64s)]
*  So when you're listening to it and you're just like going over in your head, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2703.08s)]
*  you're just like allowing it to talk to you. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2706.92s)]
*  Correct. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2709.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2709.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, just like we were going over today with Dan and her, like, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2711.0s)]
*  okay, we're in this position, but did the guy retract his elbow or did he [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2713.8399999999997s)]
*  leave his elbow forward? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2716.8399999999997s)]
*  Is the riff giving me an elbow? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2718.7599999999998s)]
*  Is there, or is there, is the riff cutting me off on a particular rhythm or a melody? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2720.96s)]
*  Cause you know, you might have a melody in mind, but you get closer to the end of [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2725.3199999999997s)]
*  that riff and it might have changed directions, then your note is sour. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2729.3199999999997s)]
*  So you have to pay attention to what note goes with that thing and rhythmically, as [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2733.04s)]
*  well as sonically, like, you know, melodically. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2738.08s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2741.56s)]
*  So it's a, it's you getting used to this thing cause, and he might be able to move [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2742.3999999999996s)]
*  it. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2746.4799999999996s)]
*  I might go back, Hey man, can we, can we adjust a few things in here and move [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2746.64s)]
*  forward? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2750.12s)]
*  So it is definitely a step-by-step piece. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2751.0s)]
*  I will respond. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2754.7999999999997s)]
*  Then he will give me back a thing or these developed further and I'll respond to [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2756.7599999999998s)]
*  his response. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2761.9599999999996s)]
*  And then at some point I'll go to Karina and go, Hey, I'd like to hear before I go [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2763.68s)]
*  too far. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2769.88s)]
*  I want to hear what you would do over what I've done over what he's done. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2770.84s)]
*  And now it's a try out of, of us navigating that sonic landscape. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2775.2400000000002s)]
*  So it must be an interesting dance in that you have to do it with people that [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2782.0s)]
*  have sort of the same engagement that you do. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2787.6800000000003s)]
*  Same level of discipline, the same, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2790.2400000000002s)]
*  same level of discipline, but strengths where I don't have strengths. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2792.6800000000003s)]
*  I have strengths where they don't have strengths. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2796.92s)]
*  So you're, it's, it's, you're kind of, you're kind of filling in each other's [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2798.72s)]
*  gaps with a common goal. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2802.52s)]
*  So yeah, so we have, we had, we definitely have common things that we like, but we [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2806.12s)]
*  also bring different strengths to the table to make it work as a whole. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2810.6s)]
*  That's one of the more challenging things I would imagine about a band is that you [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2814.7599999999998s)]
*  kind of have to get everybody on the same sort of, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2820.2799999999997s)]
*  you have to remain open. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2824.24s)]
*  Your, your listening skills are, should be as important and as honed as your [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2825.6s)]
*  regurgitating skills. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2831.16s)]
*  I'm successful and this is what I do. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2833.44s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2836.04s)]
*  No. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2837.0s)]
*  Then it just sounds, starts sounding the same. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2838.6s)]
*  You're not really progressing as an artist to like kind of reinvent yourself and [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2841.12s)]
*  see things from a different perspective. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2845.2s)]
*  Do you, my opinion. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2848.2799999999997s)]
*  Do you see this like, this process, does it, do you see this process clear more [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2850.28s)]
*  clearly now than you did years ago? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2856.0400000000004s)]
*  Like, is there something that you get better at? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2859.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2861.1200000000003s)]
*  Like anything. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2861.5600000000004s)]
*  It's just, it's, you get better. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2862.2000000000003s)]
*  I think you just get better at listening the more you listen. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2865.4s)]
*  And I've, you know, it's like, it's like anything. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2868.96s)]
*  There's a, there's a, an action reaction. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2872.0400000000004s)]
*  And then there's, there's some kind of reinforcement of that behavior. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2875.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2880.1600000000003s)]
*  I found that when I started listening more and reacting more as a listener, the, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2880.6000000000004s)]
*  the reinforcement of that behavior was that there was a better thing that came [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2886.32s)]
*  out the other end rather than just sounding like something I'd already done [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2889.6000000000004s)]
*  before jammed over something that somebody else has already done before. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2892.7200000000003s)]
*  So you reinvent and then the behavior is reinforced because the thing not, not [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2898.84s)]
*  from somebody externally, but like from the thing that you're hearing, you go, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2904.88s)]
*  I've never heard me do that before. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2908.92s)]
*  Great. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2912.88s)]
*  Keep honing that knife. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2914.44s)]
*  How long can you do that for? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2917.08s)]
*  Ever? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2919.72s)]
*  Forever. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2920.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2921.2s)]
*  Just listen forever because you're, you're going to be hearing it at a different [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2921.52s)]
*  age, you're going to be hearing it differently than you would 10 years ago [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2925.96s)]
*  or 20 years ago, right? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2928.88s)]
*  And for you life experiences. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2930.6s)]
*  So as long as it's engaging, as long as it's fascinating, you keep it. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2932.28s)]
*  I will definitely, you know, probably already, you know, I'm in, have my head [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2936.4s)]
*  up my own ass, but you know, I won't be relevant to the tick talkers of the world [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2940.76s)]
*  because that it's just not, it's not on the radar. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2947.04s)]
*  It's not those people that listen to the things they listen to and the things that [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2949.44s)]
*  respond to people that respond to the things they respond to now. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2952.52s)]
*  I'm not necessarily relevant, but there's an entire generation of people. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2956.4s)]
*  That's not just my generation. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2960.76s)]
*  There's people older than me and much younger than me that have grown with this [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2963.88s)]
*  thing. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2971.12s)]
*  And so as they're aging, they're, they're, they're discovering it. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2972.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2977.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2978.32s)]
*  Can you think, do you think about that though? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2979.08s)]
*  Do you think about like whether or not you're relevant or whether or not? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2980.6400000000003s)]
*  You can't because you'll start being desperate and getting plastic surgery and [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2984.32s)]
*  looking like a fucking alien and trying to insert yourself into some stupid [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2988.1600000000003s)]
*  fucking thing. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2992.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm not talking about anybody. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2994.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no, you can't. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2995.6s)]
*  I'm not talking about my peers. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2996.7999999999997s)]
*  Fuck man. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=2999.12s)]
*  If you're alive, you have to assume other people are going to, you're on a [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3000.08s)]
*  vibe. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3004.0s)]
*  There's other people that are going to be on that vibe. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3004.72s)]
*  There's so many people. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3006.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3007.2799999999997s)]
*  You can't. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3007.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3008.24s)]
*  The, the, the quest for relevancy is like, Oh boy. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3008.6s)]
*  It, it, it, it turns to desperation very quickly. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3011.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3015.3199999999997s)]
*  It reeks. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3015.64s)]
*  So just maintain your art dude. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3017.12s)]
*  Like just, and then, I don't know. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3018.68s)]
*  We're just having, we're having fun creating. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3021.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, you guys are also so diverse. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3023.08s)]
*  Like your sounds are so diverse. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3024.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think that's one of the strengths of you is that with tool and pussifer and [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3026.3999999999996s)]
*  like, you know, perfect circle, you've done so, so much different stuff. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3031.12s)]
*  It's like, that's the listening part. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3036.3199999999997s)]
*  What does Billy do? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3038.64s)]
*  What does, what do Adam, Justin and Danny do? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3040.3999999999996s)]
*  What does Matt and Karina do? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3042.52s)]
*  I'm listening to what they're doing and having that conversation with them and [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3043.96s)]
*  building on those relationships. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3048.48s)]
*  They're different conversations. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3051.2400000000002s)]
*  They're different people with different life experiences. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3052.44s)]
*  The art and the sounds that come out of those people is going to be 100% different. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3055.04s)]
*  Even if I'm the common thing, if you, if, if nobody knew that I was in pussifer and [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3059.28s)]
*  you were just listening to it, you might pick up that kind of sounds like the guy [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3066.56s)]
*  from perfect circle, but probably not. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3070.8s)]
*  Like it would be a whole different experience if you didn't know that I was involved. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3074.32s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3078.7200000000003s)]
*  That's why I think these kinds of conversations are so interesting to other [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3079.8399999999997s)]
*  artists, because they get to like see this sort of like, you know, you've, you've [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3082.4s)]
*  been around long enough that you're, you're, you have a foundation, you know, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3088.3199999999997s)]
*  you're solid in your approach. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3092.16s)]
*  And there's a lot of people out there that are like, am I doing it right? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3094.16s)]
*  I mean, what am I doing? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3096.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3097.7999999999997s)]
*  Is this the right way to do it? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3098.7999999999997s)]
*  Is it, should I change it? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3100.4s)]
*  Should I, what should I do? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3101.52s)]
*  And then I have that, you know, I'm, you know, I'm fairly confident in some things, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3102.64s)]
*  but I try to like change it up. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3107.04s)]
*  As much as I can, I guess, you know, it's, you know, going to start roasting coffee [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3109.68s)]
*  soon, so maybe that's one of those like resets of like, I don't know what I'm doing. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3114.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3119.24s)]
*  Let's relearn this thing that I don't have any idea and it might suck. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3119.7599999999998s)]
*  Those are valuable, right? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3123.12s)]
*  Those new things. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3124.4s)]
*  I think, I think so. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3125.64s)]
*  I think just that, you know, it could be written off to like midlife crisis, but I [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3127.44s)]
*  think it's also just understanding that chaos and change is part of life. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3132.6s)]
*  And if you can kind of get yourself to recognize that things aren't, you're not [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3139.72s)]
*  going to just get to a spot and it's going to be that for the rest of your life, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3145.72s)]
*  that's always going to be something changing. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3150.84s)]
*  I think it also speaks to the, the con, the complex aspect of thinking itself, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3152.92s)]
*  because like, you know, what is, what are thoughts and creativity and how do you [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3159.76s)]
*  keep them inspired and engaged? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3165.12s)]
*  And I think one of the ways to do it is to become a beginner again. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3167.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3171.04s)]
*  To just try some. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3171.64s)]
*  I started getting back into jujitsu. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3173.88s)]
*  It took me forever to get back in. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3176.36s)]
*  Cause I was living in a remote area, but then when I got into it, I was progressing. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3178.2400000000002s)]
*  And then I felt like, okay, I need to, you know, I need to ruin my day. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3182.92s)]
*  So I took up Muay Thai, which is like way, like I'm, I'm, I'm not great at [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3189.64s)]
*  jujitsu. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3195.56s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3196.12s)]
*  I really suck at Muay Thai. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3196.76s)]
*  Well, you also did it after a hip replacement, which is pretty wild. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3198.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3201.96s)]
*  Well, I'm not smart. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3202.16s)]
*  It's just, because it's like, why not? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3207.2s)]
*  It's fucking, they fixed it. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3209.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3211.16s)]
*  But that works that kind of a reset where you're, you're jolting your brain into [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3211.4s)]
*  understanding a whole different thing you don't, you're not familiar with. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3216.04s)]
*  The reset is huge. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3220.2400000000002s)]
*  I think. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3222.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3222.64s)]
*  And you know, now, but you know, I'm, I'm a fairly successful musician. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3223.92s)]
*  I have a backup plan. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3229.48s)]
*  I have these things. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3230.6800000000003s)]
*  I think on some level I can do that. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3232.1600000000003s)]
*  Not a lot of people can think in terms of like their entire career of a reset of [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3235.1600000000003s)]
*  their entire career, because there might not be something for you. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3238.6800000000003s)]
*  You might not be able to do that. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3242.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3243.48s)]
*  I can, I can kind of get away with that for now. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3244.56s)]
*  Well, it's also harder if you're boxed into it, like if you're a pop star, you [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3248.36s)]
*  know, you're boxed into it. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3251.92s)]
*  You know, you have like a very specific genre that you're successful in. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3254.2000000000003s)]
*  Very hard for those people to branch out. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3258.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3260.84s)]
*  You know, cause I'm sure you've met people that are fucking huge in their, in [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3262.4s)]
*  their, their genres that are just pop star huge. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3268.76s)]
*  And I don't, I don't know. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3273.88s)]
*  I haven't met a lot of those people. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3275.1200000000003s)]
*  I have no idea if there's, that there's a core person to have a conversation with. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3276.76s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3282.92s)]
*  Cause I haven't, I'm not, I don't travel in those circles. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3283.76s)]
*  Like with Miley Cyrus, there is, she's fascinating. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3286.88s)]
*  That's a, she's a unique little artist. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3290.1600000000003s)]
*  I've met her. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3292.6800000000003s)]
*  She's wild. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3293.44s)]
*  She's very interesting. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3294.44s)]
*  She's a real artist, but she's also a pop star. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3295.48s)]
*  I make fun of her in our new show. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3298.08s)]
*  Not bad. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3300.24s)]
*  It's like, I think she would find the joke. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3300.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm sure she would. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3302.72s)]
*  She's got a good sense of humor. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3303.44s)]
*  She's fun, but you know, she's a pop star, but she's also like, she experiments with [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3304.52s)]
*  shit and she's, you know, just trying to find whatever it is that, that's engaging to her. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3310.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3316.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3318.68s)]
*  And I, I, I have friends that are mutual friends with her. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3319.08s)]
*  And I think that's, that's what I'm hearing. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3324.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3327.3199999999997s)]
*  She's, she's digging. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3327.72s)]
*  I became interested in her when she did, she covered Jolene. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3330.16s)]
*  You know, I heard that song. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3333.6s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3335.04s)]
*  Like there's a soul to that girl's voice that belies her age and, you know, and what [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3335.9199999999996s)]
*  you would expect from her. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3342.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3344.24s)]
*  You know, to cover that Dolly Parton song and do it in it's like very unique way with [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3344.7599999999998s)]
*  a, like a beautiful fucking sound to it. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3349.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3352.7599999999998s)]
*  You know? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3353.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3354.7999999999997s)]
*  But again, trapped in that machine. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3355.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3357.92s)]
*  And that was that, you know, she literally had to start swearing every other word to [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3359.0s)]
*  break out of at least part of that. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3364.48s)]
*  You're so trapped into, you know, Hannah Montana thing that in order to get out of [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3366.68s)]
*  that, you had to start, you know, almost like go full Mike Patton and start smearing [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3372.2s)]
*  shit on everything just to fucking erase it, you know, to start over. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3376.12s)]
*  Well, that just, that happens to a lot of those people. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3381.52s)]
*  They just get stuck in this thing that's like uber successful. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3383.84s)]
*  And yeah, but you know, it seems like she's she's figured out a way to wiggle. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3388.04s)]
*  She has. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3392.2000000000003s)]
*  And broaden out of it. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3392.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3394.92s)]
*  But man, what a fucking, what a salmon trip up the fucking waterfall that is. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3396.52s)]
*  Yeah, because there's so many people with their hands out. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3402.32s)]
*  So many people don't that have a piece of that. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3404.2000000000003s)]
*  So many people that don't want you to, to, to branch out because, you know, anything [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3406.44s)]
*  you do that's not that they think could ruin the gravy train that they're, that [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3411.68s)]
*  they're enjoying. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3417.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3418.4s)]
*  So you can see how that might be. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3418.7999999999997s)]
*  And the egos involve like the, of the popularity and the, and the, the attention [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3421.0s)]
*  and the money, the people that you get to hang out with. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3427.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3432.04s)]
*  I'm just not, I'm not in that circle. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3433.0s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3435.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3436.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm not wired for it. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3437.92s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3439.12s)]
*  I'm not, that's not part of my world. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3439.84s)]
*  I'm not, I'm not judging it at all, but I, I, that's not part of my world. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3441.64s)]
*  I don't know how I would react if all of a sudden, you know, if I can name five [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3445.04s)]
*  huge pop celebrities of actors and musicians, if they go, Hey, we want to [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3452.96s)]
*  come to your show, like, what did I, what did I do? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3457.56s)]
*  You know, what, what did I, what, how does that, what is what I'm doing have [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3461.7999999999997s)]
*  make of any interest to you? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3466.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3468.84s)]
*  I don't know what that would look like or what, what are you seeing? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3469.16s)]
*  It's somebody, but I would be very suspicious of those people coming [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3474.3599999999997s)]
*  and actually reacting to what we're doing. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3479.3199999999997s)]
*  But is that because you box them yourself? [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3481.6s)]
*  Like you decide that like what they've created is all they are? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3485.12s)]
*  No, no, I'm just would want to be wondering what, yeah, maybe I guess, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3488.24s)]
*  maybe I'm being judgmental. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3492.92s)]
*  Uh, it's easy to do it, right? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3494.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3496.2s)]
*  Especially it's fun to do. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3496.52s)]
*  But like, because I know that I'm busy and those people are busy. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3498.0s)]
*  So why would they stop what they're doing to come and do, to pay attention [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3502.44s)]
*  to this thing, they already have all this shit going on, like, why would [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3507.32s)]
*  they come to the thing? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3510.36s)]
*  And I'm talking about numbers, not just one person, like five or six people [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3511.64s)]
*  all at once decided to come, you know, like, you know, Gwyneth Paltrow and [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3515.0s)]
*  fucking Brad Pitt and somebody, somebody, somebody wants to come to your show. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3518.4s)]
*  I'd be like, are they, were they promised something? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3521.64s)]
*  Is there something I don't know? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3525.36s)]
*  Like, why would you come here? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3526.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3528.16s)]
*  What, what, what interest would you have in this thing? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3528.9599999999996s)]
*  And that doesn't this sh how is this even on your radar? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3531.12s)]
*  You know, that would be, I would be very suspicious of that. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3535.2799999999997s)]
*  That's funny that you'd be suspicious. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3537.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3539.3599999999997s)]
*  Do you watch black mirror? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3539.8399999999997s)]
*  Uh, I started to, uh, back when it first, first, first came out and there's [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3542.52s)]
*  some of those episodes are pretty fucking amazing. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3547.2s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3549.68s)]
*  Well, there's a really wild one with Miley Cyrus and in this one, she has [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3550.3199999999997s)]
*  like this evil aunt who's like controlling her career and, uh, they [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3554.44s)]
*  download spoiler alert. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3558.92s)]
*  They download, download her mind into this little doll, like this, like [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3560.84s)]
*  robot doll that you can buy. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3568.44s)]
*  And it's like your little Miley Cyrus friend, but it actually is her inside [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3571.08s)]
*  this thing and some multiple versions of her. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3577.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3580.08s)]
*  But it's like, it's, I don't want to fuck this up because people should watch it. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3580.56s)]
*  It's a fun episode, but it's her trying to escape her pop lifestyle, but she's [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3585.0s)]
*  being controlled by all these people that have, you know, vested interest in [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3590.48s)]
*  her making extraordinary amounts of money with that, that genre. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3594.32s)]
*  And then she gets out of it eventually. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3597.72s)]
*  But it's pretty wild, but it's that thing. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3600.24s)]
*  It's like speaks to that struggle. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3602.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3604.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3604.56s)]
*  It's like, you know, you assume that Justin Bieber is just that fucking [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3604.84s)]
*  guy that sings like a girl. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3608.6s)]
*  You know, like he's sound like first heard Justin Bieber, like what a [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3610.32s)]
*  beautiful voice that girl has. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3613.52s)]
*  And then like, that's a guy. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3615.28s)]
*  I'm like, Oh, what? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3616.52s)]
*  Oh, he's young. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3618.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3619.6800000000003s)]
*  And then, you know, he matures over time and he becomes this different thing. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3620.44s)]
*  It's like, but it's still a human, you know, like if he wanted to go see a [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3623.32s)]
*  puss of a show, I could imagine you'd be like, what? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3627.2000000000003s)]
*  He would be welcome. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3631.56s)]
*  Sure. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3632.52s)]
*  Sure. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3633.2400000000002s)]
*  I wouldn't, I would never say those people can't come to my, you know, I [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3633.6800000000003s)]
*  would be happy to entertain. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3637.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm not, I'm not a, I'm an asshole, but not that kind of an asshole. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3639.04s)]
*  You're not a snob. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3642.16s)]
*  I'm not a snob. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3643.0s)]
*  No, you have a hundred percent welcome to come to those things, but, uh, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3643.68s)]
*  yeah, I wouldn't exclude anybody from that art. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3649.92s)]
*  It's art. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3651.84s)]
*  You know, something might resonate with them that would end up showing up in [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3652.44s)]
*  something that they did next, right? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3656.88s)]
*  Um, we all artists all feed off each other in some way. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3659.7599999999998s)]
*  There's like, I'm inspired by a bunch of different films, TV shows, bands, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3664.24s)]
*  for sure. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3671.2799999999997s)]
*  Visual artists, you know, those things inspire me and they get me thinking on, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3672.08s)]
*  you know, the next thing that I'm going to do and how do I build on that [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3676.04s)]
*  and make it make sense? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3679.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, music is inspirational in such a weird way too. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3681.52s)]
*  It's like a drug, you know, like prison sex, that song, there's something about [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3684.2s)]
*  that song that makes me want to lift. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3689.56s)]
*  Like when I'm lifting weights, that song is just like the guitar riff. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3691.4s)]
*  It just fucking, it just like gives you extra juice. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3694.8s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3699.12s)]
*  You know, there's something about music that it provides, like it opens up a [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3699.56s)]
*  specific pathway in you that it's like a drug. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3704.84s)]
*  It really is. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3709.56s)]
*  It's an amazing drug of inspiration. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3710.2799999999997s)]
*  And it can be a, it's a neural map in a way that opens up that, whatever [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3712.6s)]
*  that is you're getting, there's a rhythm and a tone to that thing that's [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3721.0s)]
*  inspiring those myelin connections in you to do the, do a thing. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3726.04s)]
*  I could see that. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3730.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3731.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3732.36s)]
*  And also it speaks to, especially like older music is like a time map. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3732.64s)]
*  It's like a map of the culture when that song was created, who this person is, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3738.56s)]
*  how they fit into the culture, whether or not they're around anymore. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3743.52s)]
*  Like whenever I listen to Hendrix in particular, it's like Hendrix to me is [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3747.4s)]
*  like a map of the sixties in a lot of ways. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3751.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3754.08s)]
*  It's like the rebellion from the Vietnam era. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3754.8s)]
*  It's a, it's a, it's a wine. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3757.2000000000003s)]
*  It's, it's something that happened on that day at that time on that site in [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3758.4s)]
*  that place made that certain way. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3762.44s)]
*  That's a time capsule of that, of that moment. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3764.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3767.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3768.04s)]
*  It really is. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3768.36s)]
*  And unique in that way that you could kind of listen to it and it transports you. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3769.6800000000003s)]
*  It takes you there. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3776.1600000000003s)]
*  Like Janice Joplin does that for me too. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3777.0s)]
*  It brings me to that time, you know, it just, just like you try to imagine the [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3779.76s)]
*  context of how, when it was created, who she was. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3784.6000000000004s)]
*  So going back to your original question of how we write, you have to be true to [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3788.84s)]
*  me for the way that I write is I'm trying to be true to who I am today, because [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3794.48s)]
*  those are waypoints, like as you pointed out, those are waypoints along your [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3801.36s)]
*  particular history and your experiences. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3805.44s)]
*  So if I can be in the present moment when I'm writing those things about what's [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3808.2000000000003s)]
*  happening, how I'm feeling about things, even though some of the experiences are [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3812.96s)]
*  life, lifelong experiences, how I perceive those experiences today and how I can [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3817.52s)]
*  attach those to a bed of rhythms and sounds and melodies will end up hopefully [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3823.64s)]
*  being what you're talking about. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3829.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a waypoint for that moment in time that now you can go back and revisit. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3831.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3836.16s)]
*  That's it's such a unique art form in that way that it just, it just encapsulates [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3837.84s)]
*  so many different things, lyrics and sounds and feelings and, and just, you [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3844.6s)]
*  can just turn it on anytime you want. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3849.76s)]
*  I mean, what a weird time too. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3851.76s)]
*  Cause like you just talk to your phone and tell your phone, Hey, play me this. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3853.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3858.16s)]
*  Cool. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3859.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3860.44s)]
*  So strange. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3860.7200000000003s)]
*  It is wild. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3861.56s)]
*  The access, the access to that art is so instantaneous now. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3863.2000000000003s)]
*  Just so bizarre. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3868.2000000000003s)]
*  But like anything, it's a, it's, it's a hammer, right? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3870.52s)]
*  You can use that hammer to build something. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3873.88s)]
*  You can use that hammer to destroy something. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3875.64s)]
*  This is, this is such an awful thing and such an amazing thing, depending on how [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3877.2400000000002s)]
*  you're, how you're dealing with it. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3884.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3886.48s)]
*  You can use it to gain more control, more money, or you can use it, you [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3887.0s)]
*  know, to share things with people and help them find a way. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3892.48s)]
*  And also like having a level of discipline is so important when engaging with that [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3898.2400000000002s)]
*  thing, because that thing can, you know, we were talking about TikTok earlier [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3903.32s)]
*  today about how the parent company of TikTok is using TikTok to specifically [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3906.68s)]
*  monitor the locations of American individuals. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3913.8s)]
*  And how fucking crazy that is. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3917.16s)]
*  I deleted it. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3919.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3920.76s)]
*  I never had it. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3921.16s)]
*  I wouldn't, I right away, I was like, what? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3922.2s)]
*  And then when they were talking about banning it, I started looking into it. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3924.44s)]
*  I was like, that thing's, that's a problem. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3927.2s)]
*  And then we read on one day during the podcast, we read the terms of service [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3929.56s)]
*  and what it's allowed to do if you, which nobody reads and, uh, agree. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3936.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3941.4s)]
*  Agree. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3941.76s)]
*  Everybody agrees, but it's so fucked up that when I read it, I couldn't [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3942.36s)]
*  believe that it was real. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3946.84s)]
*  We had to, I had to go over it from multiple different sites and then like, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3947.8s)]
*  I'm going to know that this is, am I being accurate with this? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3951.04s)]
*  Is it, does it really have access to your computers that aren't connected to [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3953.52s)]
*  TikTok if you have the same, like if you use the same email account, you've [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3957.0s)]
*  got the same computer and a network. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3960.76s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3962.1200000000003s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3962.76s)]
*  It has access to everything you do, which is fucking bananas. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3963.4s)]
*  So I read that over and one of my kids came home. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3967.0s)]
*  She said that her friend was mad because her mom listened to me talk [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3971.1600000000003s)]
*  about the terms of service and made him delete TikTok from his phone. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3976.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3981.4s)]

*  It's a whole new world. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3985.48s)]
*  But on the other side, there's so much, there's so much interesting [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3986.56s)]
*  stuff that you can get off of it. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3989.8s)]
*  I'm, I'm so much more educated about so many different subjects because of it, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3990.96s)]
*  because of that access to, to, yeah, if I, you know, I just, um, I just harvested, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=3996.36s)]

*  Just type in the random ingredients recipe, like all these things. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4011.92s)]
*  And there's 12 fucking recipes involving these things. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4016.56s)]
*  And now I can make this amazing salad with these things. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4021.44s)]
*  It's fucking delicious. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4023.7999999999997s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4058.2s)]
*  We just don't have the, the user manual for how to use it correctly. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4058.3599999999997s)]

*  conversation and it's a social lubricant. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4076.2s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4099.68s)]
*  But that's because of that, trying to make my own user manual. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4100.8s)]
*  I find that the reason I'm on it more than I would be is because three [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4105.28s)]
*  bands, three wineries, you know, sure. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4109.360000000001s)]

*  want to be just because I'm answering questions or inspiring plans or whatever. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4117.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4123.24s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4126.0s)]
*  For me, it's a quest for interesting shit to stimulate my mind. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4126.12s)]
*  That's I mean, I'm always looking for like, what's a new place for me to go to [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4130.36s)]
*  find things, you know, and I sometimes feel boxed in, I'm only going to like a [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4133.52s)]
*  specific six or seven different sites to try to get information. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4138.52s)]
*  Well, I need a new site. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4142.12s)]
*  I need a new thing. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4143.08s)]
*  Like, how do I get that? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4144.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4144.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4145.4800000000005s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4145.96s)]
*  How do I get access to a new perspective that I didn't consider before? [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4148.4800000000005s)]
*  Like, and not get overwhelmed by fucking pop-up ads and bullshit and nonsense. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4153.96s)]
*  And yeah, I do. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4158.2s)]
*  I do. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4158.96s)]
*  You know, we're on the, we're currently on the road. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4159.4400000000005s)]
*  This is a stop on the way we're playing Texas with the new version two of the [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4162.56s)]
*  Pussyford tour. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4167.88s)]
*  And I find that when I'm, when I'm in the break after soundcheck or before training [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4168.6s)]
*  jujitsu with whatever person I can find in that town, I end up, rather than going [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4174.44s)]
*  to those things that I should, like you're talking about, I'll just go back [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4180.759999999999s)]
*  and I'll be watching in my dressing room, just old episodes of stuff. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4184.16s)]
*  So it's almost like for me, it's like, I'm turning my brain off with my Apple TV. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4189.4s)]
*  I'm just, I'm going to, I'm just going to zone out and have like whatever light [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4194.44s)]
*  lunch I'm going to have before the show. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4198.679999999999s)]
*  I'm going to play with my dog and just let that kind of be almost background noise [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4200.5599999999995s)]
*  of what's going on. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4206.24s)]
*  So I feel like there's, there's a, an unconscious Zen thing happening with that [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4207.0s)]
*  eye candy and, you know, familiarity. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4214.719999999999s)]
*  Like how many times can I watch Teletubbies nights? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4217.679999999999s)]
*  Many more, to be honest. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4221.4s)]
*  I'm going to watch that many more times, but like that kind of thing, just being [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4223.24s)]
*  there on the background as a, as a familiar comfort, you know, blanket, you [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4226.32s)]
*  know, to have it on so that I'm not, I'm not thinking too much. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4230.24s)]
*  So in a way I'm putting that on, so I'm not on this. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4236.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4238.16s)]
*  So you're learning. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4239.0s)]
*  I'm learning to just put a movie on that like it's going and I'm meanwhile, I'm [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4240.16s)]
*  cleaning out a drawer in the road case of shit that I didn't need. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4243.719999999999s)]
*  Like everybody hands me t-shirts. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4246.28s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out like, okay, do I really want to hang out with this t-shirt? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4248.28s)]
*  There's so many t-shirts. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4251.24s)]
*  Yeah, there's so many shirts. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4252.4s)]
*  So many shirts. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4255.12s)]
*  I intentionally didn't bring you anything today because like I always, like, I feel [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4256.08s)]
*  like you're probably just every fucking time somebody comes in there, they're [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4259.88s)]
*  just giving you shit. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4262.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4264.36s)]
*  But you know, every now and then you get good shit. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4264.72s)]
*  That's true. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4267.64s)]
*  That's true. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4268.2s)]
*  It's cool. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4268.52s)]
*  I have a lot of cool shit because of that. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4269.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4271.32s)]
*  Some of it's nonsense, but, but it's again, it's like the phone thing. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4271.8s)]
*  Like you got to filter out what is nonsense. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4275.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4278.04s)]
*  What are you doing in Texas? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4279.68s)]
*  Which shows? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4281.56s)]
*  We just played, Pus River just played San Antonio and El Paso. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4282.12s)]
*  We play Houston tomorrow and Fort Worth the day after. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4287.28s)]
*  And I don't know where the fuck we go from there. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4293.24s)]
*  I think it's, I almost say Louisiana, Baton Rouge and New Orleans. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4295.0s)]
*  Eventually, I think Halloween, we're actually playing in Nashville, which [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4302.36s)]
*  I'm kind of excited about because I love Nashville. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4305.8s)]
*  Nashville's awesome. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4307.64s)]
*  It's, it's getting a little weird. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4308.76s)]
*  It's getting a little Hollywood. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4311.0s)]
*  But yeah, but every place is going to get that way. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4312.36s)]
*  It's just, you know, especially again, right back to this and right back to a [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4315.08s)]
*  podcast like this, I say, Oh, I love Nashville and that now people are going [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4319.04s)]
*  to, you know, there's going to be, even if it's five people that decide to go to [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4323.44s)]
*  Nashville because of hearing you say you like Nashville or me saying, I like [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4328.0s)]
*  Nashville, you know, when, when did somebody say something about Austin [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4332.68s)]
*  that made you move to Austin? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4337.0s)]
*  Cause like, you know, somebody said something and inspired you to move to [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4339.16s)]
*  Austin, which when I used to be here, it was a much different town when I hung [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4342.28s)]
*  out here in 1985 at what's now Elysium is the, is the club now on, on Red River. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4347.5599999999995s)]
*  It used to be, it might, it might still be, it was like a gay bar and on one [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4356.24s)]
*  night a week, it would have a thing called Club Iguana and it was like a, kind [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4361.12s)]
*  of a goth punk rock night in that location. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4366.04s)]
*  And that area was, you know, it was like the sketchy seventh street was all the, [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4370.56s)]
*  you know, kind of cool alternative gay bar punk rock thing. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4374.84s)]
*  And the sixth street was all the frat boy things. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4379.04s)]
*  I think it's still kind of that. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4381.76s)]
*  Sixth street is pretty weird now. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4384.4s)]
*  It's got a lot of cool shit. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4385.92s)]
*  Is it? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4387.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4387.84s)]
*  Cause it, you know, cause all the hip hop clubs and yeah, well, Elysium now is [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4388.24s)]
*  like, I think I could be completely wrong, but it's, it's more like it's now [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4391.48s)]
*  it's goth most of the time. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4395.2s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4397.72s)]
*  But I don't know that I haven't been in, in years. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4398.08s)]
*  Oh, I started coming here in 99 and I just, I always liked the fact that it [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4400.48s)]
*  seemed different than any other city. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4405.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4407.599999999999s)]
*  It's got its own, is this it here? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4408.36s)]
*  This is Austin in 1985. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4409.84s)]
*  Nice. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4412.8s)]
*  They look like they're dancing a wham. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4414.679999999999s)]
*  Wake me up. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4416.48s)]
*  And where, and where is this? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4417.16s)]
*  I typed in that club you said, and this is a video that popped up. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4419.0s)]
*  So Club Iguana. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4421.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4422.88s)]
*  I don't know that it's it specifically, but it's someone interviewing [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4423.599999999999s)]
*  people on the street down there. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4425.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4427.04s)]
*  How fucking amazing would it be if you see me in this video? [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4430.36s)]
*  Cause I was, I was hoping. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4432.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4434.36s)]
*  I wouldn't, you know, by day I had my, you know, my army cap on and my, my full BDU [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4436.8s)]
*  use, you know, and then, you know, as soon as we, at the weekend hit and we had the [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4441.84s)]
*  time off hat comes off two tone hair Mohawk. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4445.48s)]
*  Where's some like Adamant looking, you know, Sergeant Pepper looking jacket. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4449.52s)]
*  And then like wearing, you know, like stretchy blouse for pants with a belt. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4455.12s)]
*  So like it's, it's actually a shirt for you're wearing it like almost like tights. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4459.36s)]
*  Like, you know, we were, we had a fun time. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4462.96s)]
*  It was a good time. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4465.4s)]
*  Just absurd. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4466.56s)]
*  If you saw photos of me, you'd be like, I'm posting this shit on the internet, dude. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4467.44s)]
*  Fucking don't you fucking dare post that on the internet. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4471.36s)]
*  But that was a good time. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4475.12s)]
*  It was fun because it was something I wasn't used to in like Michigan. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4476.04s)]
*  We didn't have a club like that. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4479.4s)]
*  And it was like such a mixed diverse, you know, a group of people. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4481.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, I just love that area. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4486.72s)]
*  And so I've always had a thing since then, I've always had a thing for Austin, but [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4489.12s)]
*  I've watched Austin change over the years, but it seems like it has this great. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4494.36s)]
*  I don't have to words libertarian or, you know, center, whatever, but you've got, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4500.0s)]
*  you've got a mix of everybody here and they've managed to get along and not kill [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4504.08s)]
*  each other. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4508.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, it's a good combination of a blue city and a red state, which is kind of my [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4509.4s)]
*  favorite. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4514.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4515.12s)]
*  It's like open-mindedness and progressive, but yet surrounded by people with guns [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4515.5199999999995s)]
*  who farm. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4521.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4522.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4523.16s)]
*  You know, yeah. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4524.08s)]
*  And that's kind of, and that's kind of what we have kind of up in like in Jerome, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4524.8s)]
*  uh, Sedona area. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4529.36s)]
*  It's, it's very much that mix. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4530.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4532.08s)]
*  Um, but you know, it's, it's a, I don't know. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4532.72s)]
*  I've just, I've, I've always had a thing for Austin. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4535.040000000001s)]
*  I just like coming here. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4537.92s)]
*  It's, it's that town. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4539.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4540.76s)]
*  Well, it makes sense to me. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4541.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4542.64s)]
*  As did I, that's why I moved here. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4542.88s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4544.8s)]
*  I don't, I don't resonate with Los Angeles. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4545.6s)]
*  I don't resonate with far kind of more right cities either. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4548.400000000001s)]
*  You know, that's, there's, you know, is there a right city? [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4552.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4556.240000000001s)]
*  It just seems like there's, they don't even exist. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4556.8s)]
*  Do they? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4558.8s)]
*  Well, that's the thing about you get a group of people together. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4559.4800000000005s)]
*  They almost always become a Democrat city. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4561.72s)]
*  That's that could be. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4564.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4565.92s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4566.240000000001s)]
*  It's fascinating that you just get enough numbers and they go blue almost always. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4567.2s)]
*  All right. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4573.84s)]
*  That's the big fear about Texas is that you get enough people come here. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4574.16s)]
*  It's going to go blue. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4579.280000000001s)]
*  They're all worried that they're going to lose that fucking weird edge of freedom [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4580.16s)]
*  that makes Texas unique and independent. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4584.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4587.8s)]
*  Texas, Texas. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4588.0s)]
*  You know, I don't think you have anything to worry about Texas. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4590.08s)]
*  Texas is an amazing state and it's just going to, it's going to maintain its [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4592.68s)]
*  identity through whatever. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4596.72s)]
*  Hopefully. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4598.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4598.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4599.36s)]
*  I like it. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4599.76s)]
*  I hope it's just, you know, when you see like that video from like 1985, what's [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4601.0s)]
*  interesting about that, that that, that was pre internet, right? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4607.32s)]
*  So the identity of that was kind of organic. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4610.56s)]
*  People just sort of, you know, they just decided to all like me. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4613.68s)]
*  That was ground zero for ecstasy. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4618.0s)]
*  That was like, that was Dallas was right. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4620.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4622.24s)]
*  But like it was when I was in, in a, at that club, it had come here in its purest [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4622.44s)]
*  form and I was still in the military and I'm like, yeah, I'm not going to, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4627.84s)]
*  I'm not going to chance that. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4632.08s)]
*  So getting caught with it. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4633.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4634.96s)]
*  Or I don't know. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4635.32s)]
*  Like they said you couldn't, it wasn't technically illegal. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4635.88s)]
*  It just wasn't legal. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4638.64s)]
*  You know, it was that weird thing. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4640.0s)]
*  But like when there's just always that clause in the military, like that, but [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4640.88s)]
*  up to our discretion. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4646.32s)]
*  So like, you know, and I'm not going to, I'm not going to chance it because maybe [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4648.28s)]
*  they would detect it somehow and you know, I'd be fucked and sent the fucking. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4652.08s)]
*  The brig. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4657.799999999999s)]
*  There's a podcast called psychedelics alone. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4658.599999999999s)]
*  There's a guy named Lorenzo who runs it, who has also been a guest on the podcast, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4660.96s)]
*  but he was a pretty straight lace guy and he was living in Texas. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4665.16s)]
*  I think it was Dallas and then did ecstasy for the first time. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4669.48s)]
*  And it was like, Whoa, like, okay. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4673.599999999999s)]
*  Like this is a different fucking world. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4676.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4678.88s)]
*  I can see why people might do this. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4679.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4681.4400000000005s)]
*  And then he became a, not just a hippie, but a guy who runs a podcast that plays [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4681.84s)]
*  like old Alan Watts speeches and tenets, McKenna things. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4687.96s)]
*  And I mean, psychedelics alone is probably like the best resource of like. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4691.68s)]
*  Just psychedelic conversations and people talk and it's run by this guy who's kind [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4697.360000000001s)]
*  of thing. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4703.8s)]
*  He was a lawyer, wasn't he? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4704.0s)]
*  Do you remember? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4705.320000000001s)]
*  I forget what his, but he was like super straight lace guy who someone turned him [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4707.04s)]
*  onto it, you know, it's like Jack Herrera, the guy who wrote the emperor has no [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4711.0s)]
*  clothes like that. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4714.400000000001s)]
*  That guy was a. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4715.320000000001s)]
*  Like a gold water Republican and got divorced, met some new gal. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4718.24s)]
*  They smoked pot together. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4723.16s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they became this like hemp activist and, you know, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4724.88s)]
*  became this like super open-minded hippie who's writing books on [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4729.0s)]
*  mushrooms and marijuana. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4735.12s)]
*  Yeah, I can see that. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4737.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4738.8s)]
*  Cause those things are, you know, they all through your perspective and they open up [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4739.32s)]
*  neural pathways that you hadn't had, that hadn't been open to you before. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4743.96s)]
*  Now I wonder if you're a kid who grew up in that thing as a young kid and you [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4747.72s)]
*  tried it. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4753.76s)]
*  If it, if it wouldn't have the same effect because you're not that [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4755.04s)]
*  consciousness shift, that near death kind of thing in your body or whatever, that [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4759.16s)]
*  shifts your perspective to opens up new possibilities. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4764.72s)]
*  If that was always kind of present in you, are you a person who would build [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4769.360000000001s)]
*  something interesting or go down some intricate path or would it take you [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4774.76s)]
*  to start trudging along in the world that you live in and all of a sudden [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4779.160000000001s)]
*  having that, that moment, that consciousness opening thing that you've [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4782.64s)]
*  already established what you think the world is and then it changes your [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4788.400000000001s)]
*  perspective. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4791.8s)]
*  Yeah, I've found, I've met some people that started out that way. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4792.76s)]
*  They started out like very liberal, open-minded, progressive drugs and [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4796.360000000001s)]
*  free thinking. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4802.12s)]
*  And then they got annoyed with all the negative aspects of it and they [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4802.92s)]
*  eventually became conservative, which is, you know, they eventually realized [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4807.6s)]
*  like, Hey, like hard work and dedication and discipline are that they're very [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4811.76s)]
*  important components of a successful existence. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4817.160000000001s)]
*  Interesting how that flips. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4819.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4821.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4821.120000000001s)]
*  I could see that. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4821.160000000001s)]
*  I could see that. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4824.240000000001s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4824.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4825.6s)]
*  It's just, what's one of the beautiful things about America is there are so [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4826.400000000001s)]
*  many different ways to live and you can find these little patches of humans. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4831.240000000001s)]
*  It's sort of, of just gotten to this different mindset together. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4835.76s)]
*  You know? [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4843.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4844.4800000000005s)]
*  It's not easy to arrive at. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4844.68s)]
*  No, it's like, there's so many, I mean, there's different ways to live your life [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4846.24s)]
*  and there's different cities that you can go to and they'll, they'll help you [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4850.6s)]
*  with that. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4854.16s)]
*  They'll, they'll, they'll feed that vibe or destroy it or turn you into them or, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4855.12s)]
*  you know, turn you jaded like the New York City vibe. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4861.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4866.6s)]
*  No, I'm just like, you know, I grew up in a small town, so I kind of, that's kind [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4868.320000000001s)]
*  of where I resonate more. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4871.4400000000005s)]
*  I feed off of a larger city vibe when I'm there in it for those temporary moments. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4873.360000000001s)]
*  Um, but then I, I got to retreat back to population 500. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4881.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4887.280000000001s)]
*  Even when I lived in LA, I didn't live in LA. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4887.84s)]
*  I lived outside of it in Ventura County and, you know, dealing with coyotes and [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4890.72s)]
*  shit. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4896.4800000000005s)]
*  There's like that to me made more sense. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4897.080000000001s)]
*  Just, I need some peace. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4898.76s)]
*  I mean, I have friends that love to be on top of it. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4900.360000000001s)]
*  They love living in Manhattan on the 34th floor and beep beep honk honk. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4902.52s)]
*  I always, always kind of lived right in that kind of, near between, um, Cahuenga [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4907.72s)]
*  and Wilton in the Hollywood Hill area where you get like coyotes the size of [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4913.72s)]
*  fucking Buick area. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4919.8s)]
*  The Hollywood Hills are always, it's always been weird because it is kind of [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4922.12s)]
*  urban, but it's kind of not like it's really quick to get into, like you get to [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4926.320000000001s)]
*  Chateau Marmont in like five minutes. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4930.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4932.8s)]
*  And you're like, or, you know, needles and bum shit. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4933.4400000000005s)]
*  Like that's, that's right there. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4935.96s)]
*  And Chateau Marmont's right there. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4937.64s)]
*  And then like the Gucci is right there. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4939.04s)]
*  And then there's like a coyote and, you know, fighting over a fucking raven and [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4940.96s)]
*  fighting over a rabbit. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4945.2s)]
*  Well, especially now. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4946.320000000001s)]
*  Like, have you been now and seen the, like the, the human wildlife is out of [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4948.0s)]
*  control now? [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4952.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's nuts. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4954.0s)]
*  I don't, I don't know what to, you know, I have no, I can't really speak on it [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4955.76s)]
*  because I have no solute. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4960.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't like speaking about things that I don't think that I have maybe like a [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4961.24s)]
*  suggestion of a solution. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4964.2s)]
*  I just, it's, it's, it's a, it's a mess. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4965.8s)]
*  I can, I can acknowledge it's a mess and I have no, I have no idea how to get out of it. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4970.04s)]
*  Does it shock you? [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4974.36s)]
*  You see how much different things are like three years, like post COVID. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4975.4s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4979.639999999999s)]
*  I just assume. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4980.92s)]
*  And I guess my retreat is to try to grow more food, to teach my friends how to [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4982.5599999999995s)]
*  grow food and to understand how to, you know, distillation, uh, roasting coffee [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4988.88s)]
*  is like growing things, making, producing things in house. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=4996.2s)]
*  Uh, that's my default of understanding, like whatever's going to happen. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5001.36s)]
*  Unless it's a meteor or something crazy that interrupts, you know, uh, well, we, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5005.88s)]
*  what we've recognized it be as weather patterns and growing seasons and those [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5011.599999999999s)]
*  kinds of things, whatever's happening politically, financially in the world. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5015.48s)]
*  If we can just remember how to secure fresh water and grow things and [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5021.759999999999s)]
*  survive, whatever this is, I don't have any answers other than that. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5026.32s)]
*  That's, you know, that's my default is to, to grow things and to not hoard, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5030.88s)]
*  to actually be active in conscious, aware in the space to figure out [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5036.56s)]
*  how to survive this thing. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5043.56s)]
*  And it's, yeah. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5045.92s)]
*  It might be the only thing you can do. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5047.0s)]
*  Cause it doesn't seem to me that anybody has real answers. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5048.68s)]
*  They have opinions and they express those opinions as some more confident than [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5051.88s)]
*  others, but it doesn't seem like there's any real clear path as to how things, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5055.96s)]
*  I think it's just a time thing. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5061.2s)]
*  I think, you know, it's like, um, like the Hindus came up with the, the concept of [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5063.08s)]
*  the Yuga's the different ages of civilization. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5068.2s)]
*  I think that was very astute. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5071.72s)]
*  I think they were, they were accurate. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5074.4800000000005s)]
*  I think there's something to that, that things have to go in sort of a natural [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5076.36s)]
*  cycle of success and decay. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5079.56s)]
*  It'll come to a head and it'll, we'll figure out a way through it. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5082.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5085.68s)]
*  You just gotta take care of yourself while it's all getting weird. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5086.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5089.92s)]
*  And also help people, other people take care of themselves too. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5090.56s)]
*  So, cause that's, that's where the, the old, um, the walking dead shit goes [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5093.280000000001s)]
*  sideways when people are like just not taking care of each other. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5098.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5104.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5104.88s)]
*  That's what's interesting about that show or interesting about any concept of the [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5105.120000000001s)]
*  apocalypse and times it's the real concern is other humans is how humans [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5110.280000000001s)]
*  react to this deterioration of civility. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5115.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5118.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5120.12s)]
*  I would like to think, cause I'm an idiot and romantic, I'd like to think that we [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5120.32s)]
*  would, most of us would choose the right way to do a thing, but when faced with [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5124.5599999999995s)]
*  impossible situations, I think that we're probably going to go back to our. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5129.36s)]
*  I think many of us will choose the right way, but the problem is there's been so [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5134.88s)]
*  many people that developed in sort of a, an environment where you didn't really [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5140.88s)]
*  have to, to have earned character, you know, where you don't really develop the [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5149.12s)]
*  concepts of discipline and of, you know, of postponing pleasure and, and you know, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5157.52s)]

*  have society function correctly on other people, but yet expect it to work. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5177.280000000001s)]
*  And then it goes away and you never really developed the discipline or the [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5182.280000000001s)]
*  skill or the understanding of what's required. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5186.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5190.280000000001s)]

*  that's kind of a standard, like, you know, that's your weird corporate, that's the [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5202.5199999999995s)]

*  doing, that I feel like as long as it's feeding you in some way, that's, I'm, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5216.72s)]
*  that's what I do. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5223.599999999999s)]
*  I, I, I don't have like, I don't work like, I don't know, 10 hours and then coast [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5224.32s)]
*  for the rest of the fucking week. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5232.12s)]
*  I, that's, I'm working that moment where you're starting your workout and your, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5233.76s)]
*  your heart rate's going up and you're like, man, I don't know if I'm going to [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5242.639999999999s)]
*  be able to do this today. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5244.92s)]
*  Well, you got to just get past, you got to get past that first five minutes of [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5246.48s)]
*  getting it to the next, to the next thing. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5250.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5253.08s)]
*  And then you can do that thing for fucking 70 hours a week. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5253.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like, it's, you can get past that, whatever that little initial. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5257.44s)]
*  The resistance. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5262.639999999999s)]
*  The resistance. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5263.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5264.5599999999995s)]
*  That's the thing that people don't learn how to do. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5265.36s)]
*  And you know, now people are struggling with remote work because they don't [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5268.16s)]
*  want to go back to an office where they're forced to actually get past the [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5272.44s)]
*  resistance, you can kind of like fuck off and you use an app that pretends [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5275.799999999999s)]
*  your cursor is moving around and. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5280.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5282.839999999999s)]

*  No, I didn't. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5286.36s)]
*  When, but you know what I'm saying? [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5290.36s)]
*  Like, it's like, you are a guy who wants to be stimulated often with your [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5291.88s)]
*  endeavors and some people never to learn that. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5297.679999999999s)]
*  And that's sad to me. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5301.5199999999995s)]
*  That's unfortunate. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5304.24s)]
*  Cause I think we all could be that and we all could find satisfaction and, and [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5305.16s)]
*  just a real sense of purpose and a real sense of, uh, I'm going to say [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5311.36s)]
*  accomplishment, but that's not really the word it's like, uh, engagement. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5318.24s)]
*  You know, that where life becomes rewarding and, and, and, and stimulating. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5323.0s)]
*  And it's like, you have these robust moments. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5329.76s)]
*  He's like exciting things that are happening in, in these endeavors, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5332.92s)]
*  these things that you're choosing to do that are complicated and difficult to do. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5337.28s)]
*  And if, if you can get past that initial resistance, but some people [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5340.72s)]
*  did just never develop that. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5344.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's, that's what's unfortunate to me about people that just work. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5346.04s)]
*  They just have a job and the, the job doesn't engage them and they [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5350.2s)]
*  just want to get out of there. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5353.64s)]
*  It's like, there's other ways to live life. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5355.280000000001s)]
*  And if you could find a life that is engaging, and if you could find things [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5358.08s)]
*  that do stimulate you and find things that you do get real satisfaction out [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5361.8s)]
*  of the complexity of them and the learning and the, the growing and the, [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5367.32s)]
*  you know, the constant stimulation of those things. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5373.92s)]
*  It's like, I think part of it, and this is just my upbringing. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5377.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know that this was everybody's, but there was, my dad was very, and my [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5381.32s)]
*  stepmother were very inspirational for me to be able to always assume that [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5384.96s)]
*  maybe you don't know what you think you know, and also work, you know, work toward [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5393.24s)]
*  a thing so that you can develop just that focus and those skills and [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5398.2s)]
*  understanding connecting A to B to C. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5406.4s)]
*  Like we're going to weed this thing. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5409.5199999999995s)]
*  We're going to till this ground. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5411.32s)]
*  We're going to do this thing. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5413.2s)]
*  And at, at the end of the day, you're not going to know what, what you just did. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5415.24s)]
*  We're not going to know until like next week or four weeks from now or six weeks [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5419.88s)]
*  from now, now we're weeding that spot to make sure that this thing survives. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5423.679999999999s)]
*  And then you're harvesting that thing and we're going to have that thing for dinner. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5428.28s)]
*  When you start connecting that all the way back to the cause and effect, that [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5432.08s)]
*  was a very important lesson and how some of the things I did wrong. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5437.04s)]
*  So we don't get to have this part. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5442.04s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5444.16s)]
*  So understanding everything you had to do for your day to enjoy the thing you're [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5444.96s)]
*  doing, but also understand that you're doing it for a bigger purpose. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5449.4400000000005s)]
*  You have a connection with it. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5453.56s)]
*  Um, I don't know. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5455.92s)]
*  I just, that was instilled in me early. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5457.2s)]
*  And I think you're right. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5459.52s)]
*  Like people that don't really understand if you're doing this thing, just because [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5460.320000000001s)]
*  you're trying to survive and you don't really, you're not connecting the [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5464.76s)]
*  beginning to the end. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5468.96s)]
*  Yeah, I guess you are miserable. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5471.24s)]
*  You're going to pick up the app that's going to move the cursor around because [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5472.28s)]
*  you're not really helping anyone, but. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5474.8s)]
*  No, no, they don't have examples of those people around them, which is part of [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5478.36s)]
*  the problem of all of us is that we re you know, what you were talking about, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5482.88s)]
*  how all art is kind of inspired by other art. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5486.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, there's kind of an art to living life. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5491.12s)]
*  And sometimes we don't have local examples of someone who's doing it in a [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5493.48s)]
*  way that you find engaging and stimulating. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5498.719999999999s)]
*  And so you don't know what to do. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5501.679999999999s)]
*  And if you're surrounded by people that are just using that app to move the [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5503.28s)]
*  cursor around, you think that this is just the way to do it. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5507.08s)]
*  And then you seek thrills in drugs or in entertainment or something that just [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5509.719999999999s)]
*  numbs you the dopamine addiction. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5516.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5519.88s)]
*  Dopamine, alcohol, jerking off, gambling, anything, something that just like [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5521.0s)]
*  removes you from the Saturday morning to me, sir. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5526.32s)]
*  Sunday morning and Monday morning. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5532.08s)]
*  And I'm just kidding. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5533.8s)]
*  Um, I don't gamble. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5535.48s)]
*  Yeah, no, yeah, I feel like there's the it's it's a, it's a treading water [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5542.2s)]
*  disconnect from the bigger picture of things. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5547.24s)]
*  Um, yeah, that's a whole other six hour conversation, right? [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5551.719999999999s)]
*  Just not. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5555.599999999999s)]
*  Are you just, are you just a, are you just a clock? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5556.08s)]
*  You're like, you're just like an hourglass. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5559.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5562.88s)]
*  You're just marking time until you're done. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5563.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5565.36s)]
*  That's a lot of people. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5565.84s)]
*  It doesn't make that, that's, that's sad to me to try to. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5567.0s)]
*  Well, it's sad to them too. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5569.92s)]
*  That's why so many people are depressed. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5571.04s)]
*  It's one of the reasons. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5573.36s)]
*  Well, you know, we've talked about before, like the, the action reaction, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5574.84s)]
*  the immediate, like the immediacy of everything. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5577.5199999999995s)]
*  I want this thing and I'm bitching because, um, Amazon didn't do it. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5580.0s)]
*  Because, um, Amazon didn't deliver it to me before I ordered it. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5584.4s)]
*  They should already know what I want and it should come yesterday. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5588.759999999999s)]
*  Um, because the life is just not like that. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5592.759999999999s)]
*  And when that goes away and you're like trying to figure out how to like [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5596.0s)]
*  find fresh water, fuck, good luck to you. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5599.2s)]
*  Well, there, there are so many people that develop things that do give you [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5602.32s)]
*  that immediate satisfaction. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5607.879999999999s)]
*  And some people get addicted like tick tock. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5609.5599999999995s)]
*  You're just constantly getting in just stimulated versus being a farmer. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5611.36s)]
*  Like I've always been fascinated with farmers because when you talk to them, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5617.44s)]
*  the long game, oh my God, that's the long game. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5621.76s)]
*  The amount of work involved. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5624.84s)]
*  You talk to a real farmer, a real get up at five in the morning, farmer [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5626.48s)]
*  work till dark and be exhausted and then do it all over again and not get rich. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5631.12s)]
*  And you know, all the challenges come along with it because now I'm [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5638.24s)]
*  I'm getting my phone's blowing up last couple of days because we're [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5641.44s)]
*  spotting a bobcat in the neighborhood. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5645.88s)]
*  Well, that means now I've got to bring, I'm not even there. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5647.72s)]
*  And I've got to make sure that I'm checking with Jen and make sure she's [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5650.92s)]
*  bringing the ducks home early and paying attention in the morning. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5653.28s)]
*  Don't let them out too soon because we want to make sure there's people around. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5657.72s)]
*  And I'm literally doing things like, uh, peeing into a fucking water bottle and [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5661.96s)]
*  spreading it around the perimeter of the fence because some of those predator [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5667.5599999999995s)]
*  cats, they don't like, they think that that territory has been marked. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5672.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5677.12s)]
*  So that work? [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5677.4s)]
*  Well, I hope so. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5678.32s)]
*  Cause I'm the idiot. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5679.799999999999s)]
*  Bottles of piss along the fence line. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5681.28s)]
*  My buddy Andrew's like, yeah, you piss along the fence line. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5683.92s)]
*  Like, dude, I'm not going to go out in my yard and pee on the fence with all [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5686.12s)]
*  my neighbors staring at me, I'm going to have to like do the weirder thing, which [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5689.2s)]
*  is being a bottle and then four. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5692.48s)]
*  I, if it works, then great because I've got, I've got, you know, two dozen [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5695.04s)]
*  ducks that I got to, I have to protect them. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5698.8s)]
*  So what do you do? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5700.88s)]
*  Do you hire someone to like watch the ducks or kill the bobcat? [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5701.72s)]
*  Well, you can't really kill the bobcat. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5706.92s)]
*  It's protected. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5708.36s)]
*  So you just have to pay attention to when the ducks are by themselves and do [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5709.2s)]
*  things like pee on your fence line and like hope that they just pick. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5714.04s)]
*  Are you allowed to chase the bobcat off? [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5717.599999999999s)]
*  I think so. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5719.8s)]
*  What are the laws in terms of? [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5720.24s)]
*  I think you have to call like the, you know, the local, um, fishing game to see [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5721.48s)]
*  if they can relocate it maybe, but once that, if that bobcat finds out I have [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5726.719999999999s)]
*  ducks, there's not much I'm going to be able to do it will come back until it [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5734.04s)]
*  gets all of the ducks. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5739.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5740.719999999999s)]
*  We had that in California with chickens and coyotes. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5740.96s)]
*  They got all my fucking chickens just a matter of time. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5744.4s)]
*  So just mark, mark your calendar because eventually like in about, you know, a [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5747.92s)]
*  year you're going to like the video surface where I'm out there half naked [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5753.4400000000005s)]
*  peeing on a fence, chasing off a bobcat, you know, with a fucking paintball gun. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5757.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5763.16s)]
*  A lot of people just hire someone to deal with that. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5764.8s)]
*  That's, but that's not us where that's, this is what we do. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5768.0s)]
*  This is part of our world. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5770.72s)]
*  We, we raised ducks. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5772.400000000001s)]
*  We raised quail. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5773.76s)]
*  My wife's a, and if I told you that she's a, she's a falconer, licensed [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5775.08s)]
*  falconer now, so she's, we have a, we have a hawk named Loki. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5779.52s)]
*  And so she has, she has a full on, full on hawk. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5784.88s)]
*  So when you say licensed falconer, do you use that falcon to go do stuff? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5787.76s)]
*  Eventually, eventually we'll use it. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5792.4400000000005s)]
*  Will it snatch the quail for you? [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5794.280000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, it'll, it loves the quail, but, uh, you know, we can take it around the [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5795.12s)]
*  vineyards eventually and it'll chase off ground squirrels and then rabbits out of [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5798.84s)]
*  the, out of the vineyard. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5802.88s)]
*  I was at a Tahoe and ranch recently, which is in central California. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5805.0s)]
*  And it's, uh, there's more ground squirrels than you could possibly imagine. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5809.0s)]
*  They were telling me that the body mass, the, the biomass of ground squirrels is [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5814.24s)]
*  greater than the biomass of cows. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5819.6s)]
*  They have, they have beef cows everywhere. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5822.04s)]
*  There's enormous cows everywhere, but there's more body weight in ground [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5824.76s)]
*  squirrels than there are cows. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5828.88s)]
*  That's nuts. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5830.88s)]
*  There's so many of them. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5831.72s)]
*  There's little holes everywhere. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5833.320000000001s)]
*  I have a solution. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5834.4800000000005s)]
*  It's called his name's Loki. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5835.200000000001s)]
*  Loki would have to go to work. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5837.08s)]
*  I watched an eagle catch something. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5838.8s)]
*  I don't know what it caught, but a golden eagle. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5841.0s)]
*  I watched it snatch something and then drag it up into, uh, the, like the, the [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5842.8s)]
*  cover, I couldn't see, but I watched it come down, snatch this thing. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5847.04s)]
*  And then it was moving with this thing on the ground. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5851.4400000000005s)]
*  It's incredible how they, how they, they can see that so far away and like, boom. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5853.400000000001s)]
*  And those little fuckers are trying to get away from that eagle too. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5859.48s)]
*  This is a beautiful dance, but to be there right when it caught it was wild. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5862.2s)]
*  I try to get close enough to take a photo of it, but it couldn't. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5866.92s)]
*  But it's a, you know, that's the balance. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5870.16s)]
*  Like you have to have that. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5872.84s)]
*  And when you fuck that balance up with like a giant pack of ducks that are all in [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5874.48s)]
*  this one, it's like, this is so much food in this one spot. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5879.48s)]
*  Why am I going anywhere else? [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5882.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5883.16s)]
*  Fuck ground squirrels. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5883.5199999999995s)]
*  These things don't even fly. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5884.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5885.88s)]
*  And they'll come after your ducks. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5886.36s)]
*  What do you use the ducks for? [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5888.32s)]
*  Eggs or you eat them? [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5889.2s)]
*  No, the eggs. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5890.799999999999s)]
*  Uh, we, I make the, well, Chris, uh, at the Osteria mix, uh, uses the yokes for our [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5891.679999999999s)]
*  pasta and then eventually when I open up the, the brunch place, we'll use the [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5898.16s)]
*  whites to do, um, a quiche. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5902.48s)]
*  Duck eggs have a weird way of like coating the surface of your mouth, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5905.44s)]
*  like the roof of your mouth. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5910.16s)]
*  Like, yeah, it's a weird egg. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5911.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5914.2s)]
*  That's why I like them. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5915.0s)]
*  When you put them in the pasta, it actually works better. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5915.6s)]
*  Like just rather than just having the scrambled duck egg. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5917.88s)]
*  I don't prefer the scrambled duck egg. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5920.76s)]
*  I like using the yolk for the pasta and the, we'll use a couple of yolks, but mainly [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5922.64s)]
*  like an egg white with some yolks, a quiche base. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5926.56s)]
*  We were talking about this before. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5929.84s)]
*  I know, but are you getting your wheat from other sources? [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5930.92s)]
*  Like you getting it from outside the United States? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5934.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5936.56s)]
*  The best, the best, um, generally speaking, the best, uh, wheat flour are, it's a, [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5936.88s)]
*  it's an Italian milled flour, but a significant portion of that flour is [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5944.8s)]
*  actually hard wheat, uh, winter wheat from Arizona. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5951.92s)]
*  So you mix them like a blend. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5957.08s)]
*  Well, they do. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5958.400000000001s)]
*  They get, they'll get the, you know, all the wheat that gets, that gets [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5958.8s)]
*  grown around, you know, the Midwest and Arizona ends up going to a central, [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5961.4400000000005s)]
*  it's a commodity, so it goes to a central area. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5966.280000000001s)]
*  Then it gets shipped to a place like Italy and they mill it and blend [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5968.240000000001s)]
*  it and sell it back to you. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5972.08s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5973.799999999999s)]
*  And what's the benefit of adding the Arizona? [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5974.5599999999995s)]
*  It's a, it's just that, that, uh, that, uh, just the way that it works with pasta, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5977.48s)]
*  you know, the, the gluten structure of, of the pasta, that, that hard winter [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5983.679999999999s)]
*  wheat from Arizona is a good ingredient to make it just for texture, texture, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5988.28s)]
*  holding, holding the pasta together and keeping it a form, you know, the form. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=5994.48s)]
*  It's a, it's, it's, uh, it's pretty cool to know that like, there's a significant [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6000.04s)]
*  amount of Arizona wheat in our flour that we use, even though it's not milled in [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6005.32s)]
*  the state, it's, it's a, it's a part of the blend. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6011.36s)]
*  And is this a, an heirloom wheat? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6015.639999999999s)]
*  Is this a modified wheat? [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6017.92s)]
*  We were using quite a bit of heirloom flour from Arizona, but the combination [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6019.36s)]
*  of the blend, whatever the Italians do to blend that thing together, it just [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6026.08s)]
*  ends up being better. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6029.48s)]
*  So we're trying as much as we can to use Arizona wheat, blend it in, we blend more [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6030.76s)]
*  in, and when it comes in, just so, because we're trying to support the, [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6034.56s)]
*  the flour from Arizona. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6038.72s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you know, it's got to, it's got to have structure. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6041.16s)]
*  It's got to, it's got to be tasty. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6044.64s)]
*  So we got to do what we got to do to make it the end product be presentable and awesome. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6046.04s)]
*  How much do you pay attention to glyphosate? [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6051.36s)]
*  And, you know, the, the real debate now about what, how much glyphosate is [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6053.599999999999s)]
*  getting into our food supply. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6057.92s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6060.2s)]
*  You don't know what Roundup is? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6061.48s)]
*  Oh yeah, Roundup. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6062.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6063.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6064.12s)]
*  I, we don't, we don't use it, um, in the vineyard. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6064.4s)]
*  We used to, because we thought you're, that's what you're supposed to do. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6067.719999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6070.96s)]
*  And then our Southern Arizona, the 80 acre vineyard down there, we have [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6071.32s)]
*  awesome ground cover down there. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6074.96s)]
*  And so we just mow the ground cover down or mulch it down. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6076.599999999999s)]
*  So we don't, we're not using any of the, of the, of the pre-emergent [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6080.4800000000005s)]
*  or the weeding shit anymore. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6083.52s)]
*  It's a big debate now because there was a recent study that's, I think it was [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6084.92s)]
*  like 80% of people they tested had glyphosate in their bodies. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6088.16s)]
*  I would imagine it's all of us. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6092.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6093.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6093.64s)]
*  That makes sense because we used it, we used it on everything forever. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6095.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6100.24s)]
*  It's a, it's a creepy herbicide. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6100.56s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6103.320000000001s)]
*  And also I think they've genetically modified certain foods to have glyphosate [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6103.68s)]
*  in them, which is crazy. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6109.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6112.8s)]
*  It's like, so we're doing our best to not, you know, we use as much as we can, [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6113.320000000001s)]
*  just manual weeding, or we use the ground cover in the vineyard to eliminate [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6118.88s)]
*  that part of the process. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6123.76s)]
*  Do you pay attention to people like Joel Salatin from Polyface Farms or any of [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6126.360000000001s)]
*  these people that have like regenerative agricultural practices where they, it's [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6130.84s)]
*  interesting because I don't know if it's scalable. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6136.16s)]
*  Like the big question is like. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6138.32s)]
*  That's, that ends up being the issue. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6140.48s)]
*  Too many people. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6143.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6144.08s)]
*  You know, too many people not growing food, which is the big problem. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6145.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6148.2s)]
*  Too many, yeah. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6148.44s)]
*  Too many people not growing food, too many people in general, or just the scale [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6149.24s)]
*  of doing that thing with the current, the way we do farming, like, you know, the [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6153.52s)]
*  debate of, you know, migrant workers coming in and working on things. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6159.48s)]
*  It's a, it's a lot, it's a lot to do. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6164.200000000001s)]
*  So that's why you end up defaulting to things like Roundup and those things, [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6167.04s)]
*  because they're trying to make the margin and cut the corner to get the thing done. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6170.200000000001s)]
*  And it's an economy of scale, I guess. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6174.76s)]
*  So we're trying as much as best we can to do that in-house. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6181.0s)]
*  We grow our own food for the Trotteria Osseria and the place in Scots that we do [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6184.4800000000005s)]
*  as much as we can to grow food for those locations. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6190.4s)]
*  So the stuff that's on the pizza, the stuff that's stuffed in the raviolis, the salad [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6193.96s)]
*  you get on the Labrador plate. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6198.599999999999s)]
*  A significant amount of that is what we grow. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6201.839999999999s)]
*  You start to supplement. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6206.08s)]
*  So when we supplement, we supplement from local growers in Arizona that are, you [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6207.08s)]
*  know, organic growers that are not using the Roundup. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6211.599999999999s)]
*  But again, that's, you're dealing with a couple. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6216.04s)]
*  Three-room size restaurants. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6219.08s)]
*  Yeah, we're not we're not we're not talking about a chain of olive gardens across the [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6220.96s)]
*  country. Right. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6224.68s)]
*  They couldn't. Just a city. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6225.4s)]
*  Yeah. You know, a city of, you know, 15 million people that aren't growing food. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6227.36s)]
*  Just the sheer bulk of the amount of stuff that's consumed. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6232.4s)]
*  Right. That's the weirdest thing about cities is that we we've figured out this way [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6236.48s)]
*  to make these centers where you have extraordinary populations with, you know, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6241.64s)]
*  cement structures and water piped in underground. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6247.0s)]
*  But there's no food. Everything has to be trucked in. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6250.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6253.36s)]
*  I'm sure there's somebody smarter than me could figure that out. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6256.16s)]
*  But it's a lot more. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6259.56s)]
*  Do you ever play it out? Like, where does this go? [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6262.6s)]
*  Like, if the population keeps increasing, cities keep growing. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6264.76s)]
*  You're you're in the food growing business. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6268.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, like, you know, I used to work in a pet store. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6270.6s)]
*  So eventually the rats eat themselves. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6273.08s)]
*  You can't put you can't put a bunch of rats or hamster hamsters or worse than rats [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6277.5199999999995s)]
*  hamsters. You can't put a bunch of hamsters in a in a terrarium or aquarium for people to come [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6282.04s)]
*  and buy because you put too many in there. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6287.0s)]
*  You'll come back and half of them are dead. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6289.24s)]
*  They eat themselves. Fucking kill each other. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6291.6s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Just from overpopulation. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6293.5199999999995s)]
*  They were turned on each other and they will they will eat each other. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6296.32s)]
*  I've read a study once we were talking about rat population density studies [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6299.280000000001s)]
*  that their behavior mirrors the behavior of high population cities, [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6303.4800000000005s)]
*  that you have a certain amount of mental illness that occurs, a certain amount of violence. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6307.96s)]
*  I could see that. Yeah. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6311.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6312.52s)]
*  It's just like just like. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6313.64s)]
*  And then, you know, we would get in the shipment of the new hamsters this week [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6315.08s)]
*  and I would have to take this aquarium, move it away, put a new aquarium there, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6319.4800000000005s)]
*  put fresh shavings and stuff in it, and then move those hamsters and those and put [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6324.360000000001s)]
*  them in together that way. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6328.48s)]
*  If I put the new hamsters in with the old hamsters in their environment that they've [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6331.08s)]
*  been pissing in for a couple of days, they fight. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6335.28s)]
*  You have to basically introduce them to a new environment so that's new to all of them [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6338.959999999999s)]
*  and there's new smells and then they won't fight as much. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6342.919999999999s)]
*  So we need to start a new country, as you're saying. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6346.719999999999s)]
*  Correct. That's the move. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6348.639999999999s)]
*  Where do we go? Maybe with global warming, Greenland will be available. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6350.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Or or we could just take all the garbage and pile and compact it into bricks [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6355.08s)]
*  and make an island. Ah, garbage island. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6359.839999999999s)]
*  That's not a bad idea. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6363.5199999999995s)]
*  Something has to happen. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6366.32s)]
*  I patented it just now. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6367.32s)]
*  Copyright. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6368.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder, you know, I wonder when you look at, you know, the human race is [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6370.879999999999s)]
*  approaching eight billion people. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6374.5599999999995s)]
*  Like at what point in time do we all exhibit? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6376.36s)]
*  Like, is that the future of the human race? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6380.879999999999s)]
*  It's like the worst aspects of urban living. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6383.48s)]
*  Just universally. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6386.2s)]
*  There's, you know, that's I think it's going to sort itself out. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6387.68s)]
*  I think it's going to end up coming to a head in some way. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6390.639999999999s)]
*  And I don't know. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6392.84s)]
*  Civil War, meteor virus, something will [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6394.76s)]
*  alien invasion, alien invasion, turn us into fuel. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6400.12s)]
*  Or the other concept is that when people live in these urban areas, [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6406.92s)]
*  they they actually have less kids. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6412.04s)]
*  And that slowly population growth sort of declines naturally [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6415.84s)]
*  because people could become obsessed with their careers and, you know, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6420.36s)]
*  that doesn't seem to be happening. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6424.04s)]
*  It is happening in some places, apparently. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6425.76s)]
*  It's like Japan has an issue with that right now. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6429.04s)]
*  And some different cities do have they don't have the sustainable population [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6431.8s)]
*  for their future of what they're doing. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6435.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's the the the thought is that people are having so few children [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6437.4s)]
*  that ultimately at one point in time, you're going to see a population decline [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6442.679999999999s)]
*  and that there's going to be this sort of an implosion. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6448.08s)]
*  Like, Elon's actually talked about that, the importance of having children. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6450.44s)]
*  You know, like so many people aren't having children [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6455.16s)]
*  that live in these urban areas that you're going to see a collapse. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6458.32s)]
*  You know, I'm I'm sure there's a mathematician out there that can say, OK, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6461.48s)]
*  for every person, how many kids should I have? [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6464.6s)]
*  One, two. Right. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6468.320000000001s)]
*  You know, so if between my wife and I, there's two kids. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6471.320000000001s)]
*  Is that enough? That seems like enough. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6474.6s)]
*  One. But if you only have one, then naturally you're going to have a decline. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6476.72s)]
*  Two people have one kid. You got to decline. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6481.240000000001s)]
*  That's a lot of what's going on. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6483.96s)]
*  And maybe some people are not having kids at all because they're dedicated [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6485.4400000000005s)]
*  to their careers. OK, makes sense. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6488.92s)]
*  Yeah. Voucher system voucher. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6491.16s)]
*  Oh, well, then you have the government involved. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6494.32s)]
*  Tell people what to do and not to do. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6496.24s)]
*  That's never good. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6498.28s)]
*  Sometimes it's OK. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6501.6s)]
*  You live in like how many people live in Jerome? [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6503.8s)]
*  Five hundred. Jesus. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6506.96s)]
*  That might be the way to go. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6510.2s)]
*  You like it, huh? [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6512.92s)]
*  Well, the the the the contrast between that and touring has got to be pretty cool. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6514.12s)]
*  But if you just live there with no touring, you might get a little bored. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6519.16s)]
*  You know, you got Flagstaff to the north. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6522.2s)]
*  You got Sedona. You've got Phoenix to the south. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6524.16s)]
*  Right. You can visit other spots. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6526.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's not it's not that far away. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6528.36s)]
*  Prescott's a little hoppin' little town. It's pretty great. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6530.36s)]
*  Prescott's a hoppin' little town. Yeah. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6532.88s)]
*  I mean, it's you know, it's kind of cowboy. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6534.68s)]
*  But it's it's, you know, got some fun activities. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6536.68s)]
*  There's one area. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6540.4s)]
*  Maybe it's Prescott that's like one of the best places to observe the night sky. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6542.32s)]
*  Well, a lot of places are like that. Jerome's amazing for that, [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6546.8s)]
*  because there's there's definitely a light discipline as far as like ordinance [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6549.2s)]
*  is about having too many lights on. Is there? [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6553.04s)]
*  Yeah. So you can actually see is like this. It's crazy. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6555.92s)]
*  And it's just for that purpose. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6558.96s)]
*  I think partially. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6560.84s)]
*  You can only do that in smaller areas. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6562.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6564.52s)]
*  Like it's the the stars in in Arizona are incredible because there's [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6565.52s)]
*  there's less humidity in the air. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6571.84s)]
*  So that's just that less humidity in the air doesn't like kind of disperse the light. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6574.8s)]
*  So it's focused. You can see all the stars and you can see them Milky Way. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6579.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6583.28s)]
*  You can tell you can tell when that that's Venus. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6584.28s)]
*  You can tell that that's Venus. You know, that's a planet. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6586.5199999999995s)]
*  That's a star. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6589.5199999999995s)]
*  That's the beautiful thing about living in a place where it doesn't have light pollution. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6591.2s)]
*  There's a humbling aspect to staring out at the cosmos that really lets you know, [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6595.32s)]
*  like, hey, we're a part of this enormous, impossibly big thing. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6601.88s)]
*  Yeah. And it's not just about your career. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6606.24s)]
*  It's not just about, you know, your credit card debt and, you know, how much you owe [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6609.0s)]
*  the noise of the big city can kind of drown a lot of that out. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6613.36s)]
*  You know, really, the noise and the light. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6616.2s)]
*  I mean, it's not a. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6618.16s)]
*  It's that that environment where you have extreme light pollution and no access to the stars [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6620.16s)]
*  is it's it's very unnatural and very unusual in terms of a human history. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6627.28s)]
*  It's never happened before. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6632.8s)]
*  Up until the last couple of hundred years with the invention of electricity and the [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6634.32s)]
*  Industrial Revolution. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6638.16s)]
*  And I really think of that. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6639.16s)]
*  They didn't have that. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6640.16s)]
*  So people had sort of there was a humbling aspect to the night that allowed people to [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6641.639999999999s)]
*  just like get a perspective and also just the beauty and the majesty of the universe. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6647.639999999999s)]
*  The beauty and the majesty of the sky and the looking at the cosmos and looking at the Milky Way. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6655.8s)]
*  It put things into focus in a way that I don't think people in cities have access to now. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6663.04s)]
*  Now. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6669.68s)]
*  Come visit the desert. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6673.240000000001s)]
*  Did you ever see anything up there in the sky? [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6674.240000000001s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6676.6s)]
*  Where's that? [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6677.6s)]
*  Prescott. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6678.6s)]
*  That's Prescott. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6679.6s)]
*  So is it Prescott? [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6680.6s)]
*  Is that the place? [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6682.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6683.56s)]
*  I can't find that specifically. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6684.56s)]
*  Prescott. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6685.56s)]
*  Say it right. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6686.56s)]

*  You'll get yelled at by the locals. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6692.56s)]
*  Well fuck them. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6693.56s)]
*  That's what you want to yell at me about. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6694.56s)]
*  That's beautiful though. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6695.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6696.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6697.56s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6698.56s)]
*  And that's that's pretty much what I see at night is it looks that good. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6699.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6701.96s)]
*  Well sometimes like that one of those. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6702.96s)]
*  Go down to that one there. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6703.96s)]
*  You can see the Milky Way more. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6705.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6708.56s)]
*  Wow. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6709.56s)]
*  So that you know that that's you know when you're at night on my porch that's I can see [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6710.76s)]
*  that. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6716.64s)]
*  You ever see. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6717.64s)]
*  That's a little intense because they've definitely like it's done more of a time lapse so it's [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6718.64s)]
*  kind of like really sunk in but like on your average night in Arizona I can see it. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6721.96s)]
*  I can see all those things. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6726.88s)]
*  Wow. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6728.360000000001s)]

*  You ever see some weird shit flying around? [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6731.360000000001s)]
*  Well I didn't. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6734.8s)]
*  I was abducted. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6736.8s)]
*  And what'd you learn? [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6739.2s)]
*  I learned that I don't like butt stuff. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6741.6s)]
*  Allegedly. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6746.280000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6747.280000000001s)]
*  I don't really see anything there. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6749.400000000001s)]
*  I haven't seen anything weirder you know kind of extraterrestrial in nature that I know of. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6750.92s)]
*  I may be looking right at a thing and I didn't know that it was a thing but I don't know. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6757.76s)]
*  I'm just I'm so enamored with that sky that that to me is like that's extraterrestrial [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6762.4400000000005s)]
*  enough for me just to see that just a majesty. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6769.56s)]
*  Were you living in Arizona when the Phoenix lights thing happened? [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6772.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6776.200000000001s)]
*  I was there. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6777.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6778.200000000001s)]
*  No idea what that was. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6779.200000000001s)]
*  You know one of those things where. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6780.200000000001s)]
*  Did you ever see any of it? [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6781.200000000001s)]
*  No I didn't see I saw videos of it but I didn't see it. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6782.92s)]
*  Do you know anybody who saw it? [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6785.96s)]
*  That's a weird moment in urban history where like mass sightings in this one area. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6789.4400000000005s)]
*  You know I think of I might have talked about this with you. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6796.56s)]
*  At some point like to me it's almost like it's I feel like as we go forward in time [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6800.24s)]
*  maybe there's some kind of technology that allows us to look back in time. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6805.5199999999995s)]
*  You pay your fee at Disneyland and you can put the goggles on and it like it opens a [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6812.36s)]
*  portal in a time frame where you're just allowed to look. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6817.92s)]
*  You can just look you can't touch but then if you're if you're paying attention you see [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6822.16s)]
*  the dude looking. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6826.28s)]
*  Yeah you see the portal occasionally. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6829.6s)]
*  Yeah the portal occasionally and it's just it's just a remote viewing from a future time [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6830.6s)]
*  when they can actually like peek. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6836.12s)]
*  They can't they can't metal they can't touch they can just look and it's just it's an anomaly [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6838.12s)]
*  in your in your in our simulation. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6843.48s)]
*  I was reading this thing about quantum computing today and you could probably relate to this [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6845.88s)]
*  because you've done some music with the Fibonacci sequence and where they entered the Fibonacci [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6851.08s)]
*  sequence into quantum computing and they found it's something has to do it had something [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6857.8s)]
*  to do with different ways that time expresses itself. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6864.08s)]
*  So you could find this because I'm going to butcher this but I was reading it and I remember [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6868.68s)]
*  here it is scientists fed the Fibonacci sequence into a quantum computer and something strange [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6872.28s)]
*  happened you can have the system behave as if there are two distinct directions of time. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6877.08s)]
*  I think this is a matter of time before they figure something like that out. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6883.68s)]
*  But should we? [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6887.28s)]
*  We're going to. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6888.28s)]
*  Aren't there movies that start this way? [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6889.28s)]
*  There are but there are movies that start that way because we understand how the human [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6892.679999999999s)]
*  mind works. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6896.2s)]
*  This constant lust for technological innovation is never going to be quenched. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6897.2s)]
*  And I think if we continue to stay alive we're going to come up with something that's going [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6902.8s)]
*  to change everything about the way we interact with reality and it's probably going to happen [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6908.759999999999s)]
*  with it our lifetime. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6914.719999999999s)]
*  It seems like the exponential. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6915.96s)]
*  I would think. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6916.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6917.96s)]
*  And I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6918.96s)]
*  It probably depends on who's at the wheel. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6920.4800000000005s)]
*  It's a thing. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6924.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6925.2s)]
*  Good or bad is relative. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6926.2s)]
*  But I think it's going to we live in an amazing time because both things exist. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6928.2s)]
*  You have wine and you have farmers and people cultivating food and creating art and you [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6935.820000000001s)]
*  also have these disruptive technologies that are being implemented in a way that we really [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6942.2s)]
*  have no idea what the consequences are. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6948.44s)]
*  It's all happening simultaneously. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6950.68s)]
*  And it makes the hikes in the mountains more attractive. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6953.84s)]
*  It makes the staring at the sky and Prescott more interesting that you do live in these [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6958.28s)]
*  simultaneous sort of timelines. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6964.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6968.04s)]
*  That's a good thought. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6969.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6972.92s)]
*  Well, you're not going to stop it. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6973.92s)]
*  You know, I was having this conversation with my kids one night at dinner recently. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6975.92s)]
*  We were saying like if we just stop making new stuff right now, life's pretty good. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6979.88s)]
*  If we said all the phones we have right now, no more iPhone 14 is the end of the line. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6983.92s)]
*  Just keep making them and keep fixing them and that's it. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6989.72s)]
*  We don't need anything new. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6993.76s)]
*  But we'll never do that. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6995.44s)]
*  And then we're all just talking about it like, yeah, you're right. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6996.44s)]
*  That's why we're like we're in a constant state of invading some other area that has [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=6998.96s)]
*  some natural resources. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7002.96s)]
*  We got to get to the 16, right? [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7003.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7006.96s)]
*  Got to get to the Tesla that goes zero to 60 instantaneously that, you know, operates [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7007.96s)]
*  on some fucking gravity drive that allows you to punch a hole through space and time [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7014.14s)]
*  and pop up in Australia in half a second. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7017.88s)]
*  It's coming. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7021.52s)]
*  Just need a Subaru brat, man. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7023.08s)]
*  You'll get there. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7024.96s)]
*  Well, I'd imagine where you live, robust vehicles are probably very valuable. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7026.96s)]
*  Yeah, I have an old 73 FJ. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7032.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7035.96s)]
*  Those are the best. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7036.96s)]
*  FJ40? [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7038.96s)]
*  Yep. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7039.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7040.96s)]
*  And of course, we redid it. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7041.96s)]
*  It's like a V8 engine in it. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7043.72s)]
*  Do you use like an LS swap? [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7045.96s)]
*  Is that what they did? [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7046.96s)]
*  Like an LS V8? [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7047.96s)]
*  Like a Chevy? [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7049.76s)]
*  Probably. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7050.76s)]
*  A GM? [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7051.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7052.76s)]
*  It's a pretty amazing thing. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7053.76s)]
*  Those are beautiful cars, man. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7055.12s)]
*  Those FJ40s, like Icon out of California makes those where they do the V8 swap. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7056.76s)]
*  And it's just when you're in one of them, it's just they're so satisfying. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7063.64s)]
*  It's so mechanical. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7067.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7069.16s)]
*  Everything about it is like it speaks to you and it's so robust. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7070.16s)]
*  Yeah, mine has little ammo boxes. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7074.16s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7077.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7078.76s)]
*  Is that what you have? [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7079.76s)]
*  One of those? [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7080.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7081.76s)]
*  That's how you get around? [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7082.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7083.76s)]
*  I mean, you know. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7085.4800000000005s)]
*  Is it a manual? [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7086.4800000000005s)]
*  No, it's automatic. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7087.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm a pussy. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7088.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, I dare you. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7089.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7090.4800000000005s)]
*  Why didn't you get a manual? [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7091.4800000000005s)]
*  Because I'm lazy. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7092.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7093.4800000000005s)]
*  See that one right there, 350 powered? [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7094.4800000000005s)]
*  There's the other one, the tan one. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7095.4800000000005s)]
*  That's you? [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7096.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of one I have. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7097.4800000000005s)]
*  Those are gorgeous. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7098.4800000000005s)]
*  There's something about those. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7099.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like that's like one of the coolest shapes that people have ever figured out. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7100.4800000000005s)]
*  That's sort of an industrial vehicle or a farming vehicle. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7105.48s)]
*  That's perfect for a farm. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7109.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7110.639999999999s)]
*  Do you not fix it? [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7111.639999999999s)]
*  Or do you hire someone to do it? [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7112.639999999999s)]
*  I've got guys that fix it. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7113.639999999999s)]
*  But like, you know, as far as, you know, I still have the old Subaru Brat. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7114.639999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7133.639999999999s)]
*  It's just like 24 hours of LeMans races. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7134.8s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7149.200000000001s)]
*  But I, you know, that was one of my first cars. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7150.4400000000005s)]
*  So I knew how to change out the alternator, fix the clutch cable. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7153.68s)]
*  Like I can fix, I can fix that one to a point. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7157.56s)]
*  I would have to have a friend come in and help me if I had to rebuild an engine on it. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7160.4400000000005s)]
*  I would have to like go to another friend, but I can fix that the new cars and stuff like [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7163.88s)]
*  No, yeah, I'm lost. No. No one can yeah [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7170.08s)]
*  I mean you have to really have a fucking education in computers like the weirdest thing about cars today [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7173.68s)]
*  It's like they're having a hard time finding chips for them [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7178.42s)]
*  It's like it's hard to buy a new car some of some of the new cars [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7180.84s)]
*  There's like a backorder because they don't have chips [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7183.8s)]
*  Right because everything relies on some sort of a centralized computer. You know what doesn't have a chip [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7186.32s)]
*  No [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7194.12s)]
*  Does that 73 Toyota with the v8 does that have a chip? [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7195.68s)]
*  Well, I think that I think the engine is just old enough to where maybe it doesn't but okay [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7199.4400000000005s)]
*  I would have to ask my guys cuz a lot of the new ones they actually do have a [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7204.400000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, they do have a computer that powers it probably is yeah [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7207.68s)]
*  Yeah, cuz if you LS swap they they have like an ECU that sort of most likely it is that [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7210.8s)]
*  mmm [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7217.400000000001s)]
*  still [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7219.2s)]
*  Like those older Japanese cars are the very best cars when it comes to like robustness like those [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7220.32s)]
*  Toyota FJs FJ 60s the 62s and my dad back in the day like [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7227.92s)]
*  1973 the original little took what it's not even the Tacoma. It's it's just the Toyota truck. Mm-hmm that thing back in [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7233.5599999999995s)]
*  1973 he had it for decades the thing had like [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7240.44s)]
*  1 million miles on it. Yeah, insane [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7244.12s)]
*  Yeah, they're very valuable today [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7248.16s)]
*  Because of that reason because people realize like this is kind of fucking unique that these things are that [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7250.48s)]
*  That robust they can last for so long [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7256.719999999999s)]
*  I think by the time he actually he had sold it to a guy sold it to a guy [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7259.08s)]
*  And they actually took it to the you know [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7262.759999999999s)]
*  The dump and like they picked it up in a broken half because like the engine was still good [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7264.599999999999s)]
*  500,000 miles I think was on it and but the the frame was gone like it was you know [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7270.92s)]
*  foot through the floor [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7277.2s)]
*  Fred Flintstone down the road. Yeah, but all that stuff can be repaired [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7279.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's just to be in a place like yours and to have those kind of views [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7283.639999999999s)]
*  That's like it's a very it's got to be very grounding for you [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7288.88s)]
*  We driving around that farm and yeah, you can't have a try friend so show up and go hey, man [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7291.679999999999s)]
*  Let's you know, I'm gonna go out check out the venue and I look at their car like yeah [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7296.88s)]
*  Not in that thing hop in hop in [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7301.44s)]
*  How big is your vineyard? How many acres is it? I have 80 acres in southern, Arizona [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7304.599999999999s)]
*  I have several sites up in northern, Arizona [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7309.2s)]
*  a [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7311.8s)]
*  two acre [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7312.72s)]
*  three acre a four acre a [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7314.16s)]
*  30 acre and a five acre and how do you pick these areas that you're going to acquire available water? [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7316.599999999999s)]
*  paying attention to water rights ditch rights [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7324.4s)]
*  Groundwater rights and you expand based on the need. Yeah [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7328.36s)]
*  And so like and you know just expense I mean there's a huge expense in terms of vineyards [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7334.24s)]
*  So let's you know, just quick math [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7339.16s)]
*  Let's assume you own a piece of land and depending on where that land is [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7341.76s)]
*  It's gonna be a different price. Like if you buy an acre of land in the Verde Valley, it's gonna be [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7345.4s)]
*  50 to 100 thousand dollars for an acre of empty land [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7352.16s)]
*  Now you got to put power and water on it [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7355.84s)]
*  So if you're getting a vineyard, you're not gonna do an acre unit. You're gonna do 20 acres or whatever [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7358.28s)]
*  so [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7362.68s)]
*  Southern Arizona, maybe 15 grand an acre maybe 10 [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7363.6s)]
*  So depending on where you're gonna do it [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7368.0s)]
*  So let's say you own the land you've already paid whatever that number is [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7369.8s)]
*  Now you're gonna make sure that there's power and water to that. So let's say you've got it graded [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7373.400000000001s)]
*  You've got power and you've got water on it. That's a huge expense just by itself, right? [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7377.360000000001s)]
*  Just to plant an acre of vineyards is [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7382.56s)]
*  About thirty thousand dollars an acre [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7386.68s)]
*  So with that ten acre site you're already up to three hundred thousand, you know dollars, right? [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7389.56s)]
*  But the vines don't produce fruit [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7394.6s)]
*  for [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7397.72s)]
*  Four years. Whoa, so you're not gonna see your first grape and even if you get your grape now [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7399.16s)]
*  You're gonna wait, you know, you got to make it you got to age it. You got a bottle you got to sell it [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7404.58s)]
*  so from your first [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7408.62s)]
*  Assuming you own the acres and assuming you have power and water and it's been graded [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7411.12s)]
*  And you're thirty thousand dollars in for your first for that first planting that first year [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7416.22s)]
*  You're not gonna see your first dollar for at least six seven years [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7420.82s)]
*  So when you acquired your first [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7425.38s)]
*  Farm was it an existing? [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7428.3s)]
*  My nary no the the land that I planted the Judas block on I planted that vineyard [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7431.42s)]
*  And I was sourcing fruit from other vineyards for a while [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7436.58s)]
*  How long did you think about doing that before you actually pulled the trigger? [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7439.76s)]
*  I was kind of mulling it over from starting around 99 2000 Wow, and then I planted my first fingers in 2003 [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7443.4800000000005s)]
*  Were you like what the fuck am I doing? Yes [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7452.4s)]
*  I'm just on today in this very moment. I'm wondering what the fuck did I do and what am I doing? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7455.4800000000005s)]
*  How many people do you have working for you now if you have that many different farms between between post refer [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7462.4800000000005s)]
*  The post for store, you know all of our distribution people our retail people are behind the scenes, you know [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7468.52s)]
*  seller workers [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7476.68s)]
*  I'm about [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7478.52s)]
*  110 families that we employ Wow [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7480.12s)]
*  around around, Arizona and [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7484.16s)]
*  So when you develop a piece of land, it's like if say if you want to start and expand into a new piece of land [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7487.4400000000005s)]
*  Who do you have [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7495.04s)]
*  Who do you have this person have to relocate there? [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7497.72s)]
*  Do you have to have someone that can commute to the spot and make sure it's running? Okay for the four years? [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7500.44s)]
*  Well, so so down, you know down in southern Arizona Jesse lives on site with his wife and we have you know [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7506.28s)]
*  A couple full-time people and if you're farming it properly you need seasonal work [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7511.24s)]
*  You need people to come in and like a large number of people to come in and prune a large [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7515.84s)]
*  number of people to come in and do [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7520.84s)]
*  Shoot thinning and blah blah blah and then for picking of course, you've got that season [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7523.360000000001s)]
*  You have people around you have to do the pick and you have to work with a labor contractor to make sure that you have [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7527.96s)]
*  those numbers of people there to do that but [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7533.12s)]
*  Annually year-round those those two or three people are on site all year round [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7536.16s)]
*  I would imagine that is always in the back of your head that you have all these different moving parts going on constantly. Yeah [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7541.360000000001s)]
*  How do you rest [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7549.400000000001s)]
*  You just be either do your don't right you just rest, you know [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7553.400000000001s)]
*  But that's a lot of a lot of noise [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7559.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's why you watch telly day and nights and fall asleep [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7562.0s)]
*  God from the time that you started doing that did you ever imagine that it would be what it is now [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7570.0s)]
*  No, I thought it was gonna be a much smaller thing [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7574.44s)]
*  It's still a pretty small thing. But as far as all the moving parts and all the beautiful things we've got that we've accomplished [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7578.12s)]
*  No regrets, I think we're doing there's a pretty cool thing we're doing is very cool [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7587.28s)]
*  That's when I really started getting interested in you honestly when I found out about your vineyard. I was like, huh? [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7591.4s)]
*  What a fucking weird guy [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7597.32s)]
*  Yeah, he's doing that. There's you know, there's a couple of people that are doing that [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7599.32s)]
*  There's you know, there's a couple people in my in our genre [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7603.04s)]
*  Not even really our genre just like musicians that there's a couple people that are doing stuff [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7607.12s)]
*  I think pink is involved in her wine production in some way [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7611.28s)]
*  But I'm you know, other than her and a couple people [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7617.04s)]
*  Not anybody you hear that has a wine label generally speaking is they're just putting their name on it or they have somebody doing it [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7621.04s)]
*  For them and they might be kind of involved, but they're not [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7627.96s)]
*  They're not as involved as I am no [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7631.08s)]
*  That's just it's so [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7634.599999999999s)]
*  involved it's [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7636.799999999999s)]
*  Do you ever anticipate not doing music and just doing that? Do you think you're always gonna be doing everything? [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7639.16s)]
*  I think I'll be doing everything. I don't really see any reason to give up either one because they can coexist [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7643.36s)]
*  there's definitely time for both because especially if you're [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7649.719999999999s)]
*  organized like I am and create those spaces for [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7653.679999999999s)]
*  Creating music and touring but knowing that you it's not up to you when the when it's harvest season, this is harvest season [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7657.52s)]
*  So I like that balance of like I had to respond to what Mother Nature says on this front [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7665.16s)]
*  But on the music side I can kind of have a little more flexibility and and and create [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7671.2s)]
*  When the spirit moves me has to be a wild challenge though to figure out how to scale that [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7676.88s)]
*  Like as it was happening and grow like how did you figure out how to make it all work? [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7681.96s)]
*  I don't know that I have yet [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7688.12s)]
*  You know, we're just we're we're figuring it out still [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7690.879999999999s)]
*  Wow [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7695.5599999999995s)]
*  It's um [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7698.44s)]
*  it's very complex, but it [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7700.16s)]
*  It makes for a very unique experience. I would imagine in life [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7702.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, yeah, I'm like going back to like you started this thing and [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7708.52s)]
*  seven years later and then I put that wine in a bottle and I try to forget about that bottle to [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7712.56s)]
*  Then open that bottle another ten years later [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7718.4400000000005s)]
*  to go [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7721.88s)]
*  I did that. Yeah, and there's a time when you should open it too, right? [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7725.400000000001s)]
*  Depends on the grape honestly, you know, how do you know you don't I mean especially in an area that we're [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7730.320000000001s)]
*  Growing and the grapes that we're not quite sure about yet [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7736.799999999999s)]
*  There's definitely things in wine [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7739.759999999999s)]
*  That help it be an ageable wine [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7742.2s)]
*  Or that won't that won't fall apart [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7745.799999999999s)]
*  right away [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7748.759999999999s)]
*  But you know [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7750.24s)]
*  There's some there's chemical things you can kind of figure out like what what do we think my age better? [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7751.639999999999s)]
*  But until you actually open that bottle 15 years later, you don't you don't really know you think you might know but you don't know [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7759.08s)]
*  Have you ever heard of a book called the immortality key? [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7766.4s)]
*  there's a guy named Brian Murorescu who became obsessed with the Lucidian mysteries and [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7770.16s)]
*  the ancient Greeks who [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7777.96s)]
*  drank wine and invented democracy and invented all these different things in this like one particular area of enlightenment and [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7780.48s)]
*  He started studying this and found [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7788.88s)]
*  Very distinct evidence that the wine what they were calling wine [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7792.28s)]
*  back then was wine that was mixed in with a bunch of different things and [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7796.24s)]
*  A lot of it was like ergot and a lot of it was psychedelic compounds and probably yeah through this [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7802.4s)]
*  They've actually developed a field of study at Harvard [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7808.5599999999995s)]
*  Through his work and he came on the podcast and talked about it and sort of opened up this field of study [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7811.639999999999s)]
*  Is that the book is really fascinating because he's he was obsessed with this for decades and [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7816.48s)]
*  Studied it for a long time and then they eventually found physical evidence in these old wine vessels. Okay [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7823.599999999999s)]
*  And then because it would be there like that's that's the cool thing about those there's always gonna be some [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7830.72s)]
*  Chamber that's gonna be unearthed that nobody knew was there and if it's if it's grace or you know early Roman time [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7836.4s)]
*  But there's gonna be wine in that thing [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7843.36s)]
*  That's what wine was. There's gonna be some bottles in there. Wine was wine was like fermented grapes [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7845.5199999999995s)]
*  But it was mixed in with a bunch of other stuff. Yeah, that was what they used to when we think of wine [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7850.36s)]
*  We think of what you make but what you make is not just the grapes, right? [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7855.28s)]
*  Like not just fermented grapes there's stuff in there. No, no, it's all it's just grapes [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7860.08s)]
*  But you add you add some sort of [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7864.0s)]
*  Yeast or yeah, I mean that's well [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7867.679999999999s)]
*  No, I thought the yeast already is exist it exists on the on the grapes and so our our fermentation process is [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7869.92s)]
*  Is kick-started by the yeast that exists on those grapes? So I do I knew I just do wild ferments [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7876.56s)]
*  I don't you add yeast some instances [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7882.84s)]
*  I do depending on the fruit coming in and if I'm observing there's gonna be maybe some problems with that particular batch of fruit [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7885.24s)]
*  Yeah, maybe I'll add a do a an inoculation for that thing [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7892.12s)]
*  But we're 95% while ferments, but I do also do [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7896.24s)]
*  Mead which is honey water yeast [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7901.08s)]
*  So we do that fermentation to do canned. I think it brought you some yes. You did the canned meat [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7905.44s)]
*  We had some at your Osteria was amazing. Yeah, so that really wild tasting like different than anything [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7911.24s)]
*  I think I'd ever drank before yeah, but that we also were about to can it but I actually did a fermentation with the mead [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7916.639999999999s)]
*  I did one with lavender one with hibiscus one with bergamot and one with star jasmine [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7923.36s)]
*  Just to see what that would land as far as a floral nature in that in that in that mead [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7930.5599999999995s)]
*  We'll see haven't we haven't actually can it yet to see how that went [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7936.4s)]
*  But you also have like an a natural sparkling like a white wine [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7939.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the the the pet Nat we call it. It's a an ancient method of [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7944.799999999999s)]
*  Letting the letting the wine finish fermentation in a in a bottle [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7950.36s)]
*  So it's kind of like champagne. Yeah, but different but more [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7956.0s)]
*  Different tasting it was yeah kind of more complex [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7960.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think some chant, you know, if you're a champagne person versus like an Italian sparkling [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7964.16s)]
*  I'm now I'm getting all geeky with people that are wine drinkers, but what we're doing in Arizona is far more like a a [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7970.879999999999s)]
*  a filtered [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7978.52s)]
*  Ancient method [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7981.240000000001s)]
*  Italian sparkling because it's malvissi a Bianca and Chardonnay 5050 [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7984.320000000001s)]
*  So it's if people are for people listening if you're wondering what kind of sparkling I'm doing. That's a that's a pet Nat [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7988.120000000001s)]
*  It's very much in a an Italian sparkling approach rather than a champagne [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=7994.52s)]
*  the reason why I brought up the Brian Murer rescue book because I've always been fascinated like [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8000.080000000001s)]
*  That was what wine used to be that wine was [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8004.36s)]
*  The fermented grapes mixed in with psychedelics and all these other compounds that they're sort of discovering [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8008.0s)]
*  When did modern what we think of as wine now, which is like what you make when did that start? [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8014.04s)]
*  No idea. Yeah [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8021.24s)]
*  Could very well be some kind of way before [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8024.96s)]
*  Pre-prohibition kind of stuff and Europe. I have no idea [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8030.64s)]
*  But you know, I know that there's there's people that have done like botanicals where they're kind of doing almost like beer [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8033.96s)]
*  bearish wine ish [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8040.68s)]
*  botanical fermentations [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8042.32s)]
*  Various, you know varying results, but I don't know that really research it. Did you ever see the documentary sour grapes? Yeah [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8044.36s)]
*  Wild shit, right? Yeah, that guy was amazing [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8051.84s)]
*  crazy, yeah, yeah that one of my good friends is in that documentary I [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8054.88s)]
*  Met that gentleman who got arrested I met him at a wine tasting and like did you [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8061.16s)]
*  Really? I was with Peter Gago from tenfolds. They were doing a whole penfolds Australian wine [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8068.2s)]
*  dinner at the Australian [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8074.36s)]
*  Consulate house or whatever and that guy was sitting right here. What was his name again? I remember his name [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8076.88s)]
*  It was right at the tip my it was like an American name [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8083.08s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8085.52s)]
*  I met him because my friend is a wine dork and he had a birthday party [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8088.040000000001s)]
*  so went to his want to say it's 2003 and [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8095.080000000001s)]
*  we all were sitting around and they would serve this incredible food with flights of wine and [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8099.56s)]
*  They'd all brought their own wine they were popping corks and [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8107.120000000001s)]
*  Rudy Rudy yeah, he's out now. Yeah. Yeah his his you know [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8110.68s)]
*  Never mind the shady shit. He was up to that's you know, that's why you went to prison buddy [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8116.88s)]
*  But his palate and his ability to mimic those things was fucking otherworldly [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8120.92s)]
*  It's he was really good at that [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8127.68s)]
*  Thing and his and his perception of things in that bottle in that glass to be able to reproduce that [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8130.0s)]
*  the way he did was [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8136.96s)]
*  That was why I brought it up like did he reproduce it accurately like enough enough to fool complex palates [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8138.96s)]
*  Mm-hmm, just enough because you know, there's there's bottle variation on things [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8145.92s)]
*  So it could be like this one doesn't quite taste like the ones I've had before [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8149.6s)]
*  Right, right and that could be expressed in legitimate bottles [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8154.8s)]
*  Yeah, but from 2001 to 2000 this yeah different [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8158.96s)]
*  Climate different. Yeah, whether was different that year [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8164.04s)]
*  Weather was different that year. Yeah, the funny part was like people that were totally duped. Yeah like [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8167.28s)]
*  What? [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8174.0s)]
*  Yeah [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8175.4s)]
*  No, these minor minor cool. I wasn't I'm not a dupe [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8176.76s)]
*  Well was funny in the people who are self professed wine experts was like this one's real [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8179.84s)]
*  And then another guy would come along go this is garbage [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8186.28s)]
*  I'm like, well, how can there be such a varying opinion among amongst people that are actually miss [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8189.12s)]
*  There's always been that kind of like, you know, you can't taste how expensive a wine is well [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8194.039999999999s)]
*  No, of course, you can't taste how expensive a wine is it but there are guys who are really good at identifying [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8197.88s)]
*  Right down to the year and the producer [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8204.039999999999s)]
*  By what they're tasting in a glass and it's like I think it's it's fucking it's voodoo [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8207.64s)]
*  It's like it's incredible how they can do that. They can narrow it down [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8212.119999999999s)]
*  And that's of course from an established [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8216.72s)]
*  Region that has a history that there's you can kind of track it [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8219.839999999998s)]
*  To a point through time and having maybe had that wine and they have that [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8223.96s)]
*  fucking [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8229.8s)]
*  Lock box. Yeah, they can they can log that shit away and it's like a you know steel trap of [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8230.839999999998s)]
*  Recollection of those things those guys are incredible. Yeah, I've talked to [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8237.0s)]
*  Somalias that claimed to be able to do that and I've tried to get it from them [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8241.88s)]
*  Like what are you doing? Like how are you doing that? [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8247.06s)]
*  What what is it about a while you can drink it and say there's a checklist and that they go through it's a very rigorous [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8249.52s)]
*  drilling of a checklist of things that they [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8256.92s)]
*  Identify the first thing they identify the second thing they identify my and it's not you know, it's it's more [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8259.08s)]
*  Like okay when I walk into when I pull into your parking lot [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8265.160000000002s)]
*  Is this a house or is this an industrial complex or is this a barn or is this a an airport? [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8269.28s)]
*  Well, it's an industrial complex. Okay now [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8274.560000000001s)]
*  Is there parking yes, there's parking okay when we walk in is it, you know [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8277.68s)]
*  So you're you're going through this checklist of just super general shit down to very specific things [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8281.92s)]
*  Have you tried to learn that fuck? No, man. I got way too much shit to do with that shit [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8288.480000000001s)]
*  but I would imagine like in [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8294.34s)]
*  Making wine like you do there you have to have some sort of a palette [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8297.28s)]
*  Yeah, but you know at the same time I don't have to sound like Led Zeppelin it just had to sound like me [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8302.88s)]
*  So I'm only expressing these grapes are gonna tell me what [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8308.72s)]
*  They're gonna do and I'm gonna try to get out of the way to make sure that these grapes grow from grapes to wine [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8312.32s)]
*  And I'm gonna do everything that I know how to do to get out of the way to make sure that thing is that thing [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8317.16s)]
*  Now me describing in that thing to you like a psalm describes it. I can't do that for you [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8322.359999999999s)]
*  But I can get out of the way to make it get to the thing that you can describe that's your job [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8328.34s)]
*  But when you decided to do this in 2000 when you had you must have had some sort of an esoteric appreciation [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8333.220000000001s)]
*  Yes, hundred percent. I just couldn't describe that to you and I couldn't map out what year was what wine [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8341.660000000002s)]
*  I could just tell you that everything about this wine is [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8346.900000000001s)]
*  inspirational in some way [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8351.380000000001s)]
*  Whether it's like at the age on it the acid structure something all the all the pistons were firing in terms of like all the [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8353.9s)]
*  sensory [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8361.859999999999s)]
*  Alarms that are going off in my mouth [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8364.179999999998s)]
*  The length of the experience like how it's changing in the glass [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8367.06s)]
*  Yeah, that was very inspiring to me as far as actually being able to map that out for you. I'm an idiot [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8370.48s)]
*  I couldn't do it. Did you go through any sort of education in terms of like what is involved in the creation of a wine? [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8375.9s)]
*  That you appreciate I just thought time time and seller expending time in in Adelaide Hills at the [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8383.46s)]
*  Penfolds for a very short amount of time [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8390.58s)]
*  Seeing it happening around the world [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8393.66s)]
*  Going to wineries while on tour while they're Harvard trying to time it where I can go [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8395.859999999999s)]
*  When they're gonna actually harvest today to see what's the equipment are you using? What are you doing? [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8399.9s)]
*  Like how do you how are you doing this thing? Like when did that spark get ignited like what 99? [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8404.46s)]
*  So it was like right before you started. Mm-hmm [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8409.82s)]
*  So before that were you a wine connoisseur? Were you a wine appreciator? [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8412.9s)]
*  I started appreciating wine maybe around 96 really. Yeah, so just a few years later you own a vineyard. Yeah, that's crazy [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8417.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it just resonated whatever it was it clicked [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8425.699999999999s)]
*  It's like, you know going back to I was talking to Donald today [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8429.06s)]
*  He's like he walked into Hickson's place on Pico back in the day [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8432.699999999999s)]
*  Henry Ankins walked in the same week that I walked in to Hickson's Academy back in 95 [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8436.16s)]
*  Henry Ankins is one of the best black belts. I've ever met. I [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8443.2s)]
*  Can't I can barely tie my belt [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8448.08s)]
*  You know, so it resonated it resonated with him it made sense to him it clicked and it went and there's no way you can [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8451.44s)]
*  Figure out what that is to make you know make him what he is. Right? I was not that guy [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8457.68s)]
*  I was not that guy I had to work harder on it wine was like I had been doing it my whole life [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8463.44s)]
*  Almost instantly it made sense [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8469.4s)]
*  And then and then slowly backing up and understanding the chemistry of it working with people to go action reaction [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8472.480000000001s)]
*  And logging that in to develop that you know constantly but the process [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8479.4s)]
*  Just the basic logistics of making wine made sense to me almost instantaneously [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8485.4s)]
*  Almost instantaneously and this was from 96 like when no my first wine that you know actually was involved in making [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8490.64s)]
*  Who was 2004? [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8498.96s)]
*  But but in 96 when you first started getting interested in it you went to a vineyard you [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8502.08s)]
*  It was just dinners like you're you know, you start to all of a sudden went from a dude who you know woke and grew up in [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8509.0s)]
*  A you know lower [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8514.32s)]
*  Middle class family with teachers on you know teach [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8516.48s)]
*  Parents are to teach your budget, you know cutting wood for the winter to being on tour with a band and all of a sudden [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8520.8s)]
*  I can afford a bottle of wine that was more than $50, you know going oh, this is cool [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8526.92s)]
*  seeing all the all the agents and the the lawyers and the fucking promoter and the manager and the fucking accountant all [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8533.4s)]
*  Backstage having a nice glass of wine while I'm drinking Bud Light over here going with fucks that [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8541.32s)]
*  Mmm, I want to know and I grab a glass and tried it and went [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8547.44s)]
*  This is the new thing. This is something I want to know about [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8551.800000000001s)]
*  And when was the first time you actually went to a do you remember the first vineyard you visited while they were doing all that? [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8555.48s)]
*  I want to say it was like 97 I [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8561.24s)]
*  think [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8565.4s)]
*  98 it was um [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8566.880000000001s)]
*  Pegasus Bay in New Zealand in New Zealand [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8569.72s)]
*  Yeah, so those watching the process watching. No that was I think they were doing sablonk. I think [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8574.72s)]
*  It might have been Pino. I think was Pino [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8581.32s)]
*  But they were do stemming and I was watching the stemming process going. Okay. Okay machine I can afford a machine [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8584.24s)]
*  And you just thought one day I'm gonna do that. Yeah, and then the wheels started getting into motion. Yeah [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8592.16s)]
*  Wow [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8598.88s)]
*  How many people around you're going Maynard? What the fuck are you doing all of them? [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8600.119999999999s)]
*  All it just seems like such a fucking intensive [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8607.48s)]
*  Complicated [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8615.16s)]
*  Endeavor yeah [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8616.56s)]
*  But it's rewarding. I mean it's work. You're you're grounding [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8618.439999999999s)]
*  There's setup. There's cleanup. There's logistics like Tim and I are like the logistics Nazis [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8622.64s)]
*  It's we have to there's there's a way to do it to not get in your own way to understand the 16 steps [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8629.359999999999s)]
*  Like today dealing with that triangle [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8636.359999999999s)]
*  I kept getting my foot caught up and trying to get the leg around the head [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8638.199999999999s)]
*  Because I was getting in my own way [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8641.72s)]
*  I didn't I didn't shift enough to make it so that I wasn't in my own way right in the cellar [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8643.339999999998s)]
*  I'm not in my own way [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8647.759999999998s)]
*  I'm thinking five steps ahead [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8649.16s)]
*  And I'm not gonna put a thing down in the way that I have to move and add six steps to get into the next [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8650.96s)]
*  Step and this is a thing that you get better at with I guess I get better at it with every with every harvest [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8656.04s)]
*  But I was already naturally inclined that way as far as logist like Tetris is my thing [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8661.800000000001s)]
*  hmm [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8667.36s)]
*  Wow [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8668.76s)]
*  That's why because there's nothing like that in my mind that that I'm fascinated by that. I would want to go and start [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8670.080000000002s)]
*  developing a company that makes these things [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8677.52s)]
*  it seems like [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8680.640000000001s)]
*  it's just so rare that something like [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8682.36s)]
*  Light bulb goes off and you're like I need a wine press. Yeah [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8685.64s)]
*  Wow, so when you like crack open a bottle of wine today, do you ever open one and go I should have waited I [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8693.84s)]
*  Mean yeah, there's there's those instances or I open up some of my some of stuff from before and go [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8703.88s)]
*  Yeah, I fucked that up. This is a good bottle. It's okay [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8709.039999999999s)]
*  But I know that I could have done better on this bottle and what would you have done to do better? [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8712.46s)]
*  Well, it depends on the great depends on what I did and it depends on the thing [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8717.26s)]
*  But you know, there's adjustments that I've made over the years that have made it so that there's a there's a higher percentage of success [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8720.619999999999s)]
*  For that for that year. What are those variables? It's all depends on them [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8728.38s)]
*  Depends on the grape depends how we picked it depends on what it did [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8733.539999999999s)]
*  Too much. Oh, cuz it not enough oak [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8737.3s)]
*  You know [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8739.779999999999s)]
*  Oaken the casket. Yeah [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8740.939999999999s)]
*  Well in the cat, you know when you're putting stuff in barrels that too new is there too much flavor [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8742.699999999999s)]
*  I mean imparting too much flavor on on the wine [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8746.74s)]
*  I'm not going back and tasting some of the stuff I earlier did it's because they were new [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8749.519999999999s)]
*  I just bought the barrels. So there's a lot of oak on some of the earlier wines that I did [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8753.779999999999s)]
*  It's not there now because now they're older barrels are no longer imparting that flavor of oak. So [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8759.3s)]
*  In hindsight, I you know, they can't change it it's done right but I might have [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8765.76s)]
*  Aged the barrels. Yeah get get more I get a couple new but but buy some neutral ones from somebody instead [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8771.04s)]
*  So that like there was just a kiss of oak on it rather than a lot of new oak [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8777.400000000001s)]
*  So there's a company that specializes in creating barrels [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8781.400000000001s)]
*  They just go you go to some of the other wineries that are that are cycling through some of their barrels and you can buy [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8785.0s)]
*  Use barrels from a reputable wineries. That's how I was gonna ask you next. Do you reuse your barrel? [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8789.84s)]
*  I use as much as I possibly can because I don't necessarily want the oak [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8795.12s)]
*  Influence on the wine. Does the wine that was in the barrel influence future wines? No, you're rinsing it out pretty good [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8799.92s)]
*  You know, you know, you're cleaning them out. What do you clean it with steam? [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8806.400000000001s)]
*  So there's no chemicals. No nothing just water steam and water. Yeah Wow [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8810.44s)]
*  How the fuck do you have time for all this I just don't understand this [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8816.44s)]
*  Logistical time management I understand but I don't understand where it's [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8821.480000000001s)]
*  There's no I'm looking at a clock. I'm going hey this goes around [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8825.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's 12 of those and there's another 12 like where the fuck is the time? Yeah organizational skills [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8828.76s)]
*  Do you ever anticipate doing anything else with this sort of? [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8834.400000000001s)]
*  The the amount that's involved [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8838.880000000001s)]
*  No, I think cuz like when it comes to like I'm right my Tim and I are gonna develop probably gonna develop a gin [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8841.28s)]
*  But that will be 100% us just coming up with a label coming up with a concept coming up with maybe a recipe and then [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8848.320000000002s)]
*  handing that to some [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8854.480000000001s)]
*  House, I don't even know what gin is. I know it's an alcohol. I have no idea what you make it out of [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8856.36s)]
*  It's well depending, you know depending on the gin [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8861.480000000001s)]
*  It can be you know grain based but like I'm probably gonna go more for a molasses based spirit [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8864.92s)]
*  Molasses you ferment the molasses to give you the spirit [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8871.04s)]
*  Is that a common thing for gin and then some of my favorite ones are a lot of it ends up being more the green [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8874.560000000001s)]
*  You know green based but there's also people that have done honey honey gin [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8880.84s)]
*  Yeah, so what gin is like what what when you're saying gin? [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8886.24s)]
*  I know it's an alcohol juniper is the key ingredient to it to make it a gin juniper is one of the botanicals that comes [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8890.16s)]
*  Into either during the distillation process or post distillation juniper is involved [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8896.6s)]
*  But you can also do other things and other botanicals and things and to make it a more unique gin [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8903.64s)]
*  Now what about tequila? [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8909.58s)]
*  Tequila is agave, but I don't really I don't know the process on tequila [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8912.18s)]
*  That much I'd like to know but I think gin is more [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8917.26s)]
*  it's gonna be more accessible to me because it's just the process of you know, you know the [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8922.02s)]
*  Over-farming and tearing up land if I can put in agave. I don't know what that sound over farming [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8927.66s)]
*  Yeah, just like I'm not you know [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8933.58s)]
*  I've heard rumors of like just like in tearing through Mexico and fucking up entire landscapes to deal with like the agave [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8935.099999999999s)]
*  Thing is a it's a controversial subject. Oh, really? I think so [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8941.619999999999s)]
*  What I was reading about I got a I'm trying to hurt it [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8946.259999999998s)]
*  I don't want to die. I don't want to hear about it right now. I got other shit to think about [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8949.34s)]
*  I was reading about the the health aspects of [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8952.9s)]
*  Tequila that tequila actually has a probiotic benefit to it [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8958.019999999999s)]
*  And that it has less sugar in it. So people find it to be more healthy [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8963.3s)]
*  Well than drinking other forms of alcohol [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8967.699999999999s)]
*  Maybe I mean, you know, I suppose me not having five of those one night is probably not the smartest thing [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8970.38s)]
*  Yeah, waking up the next day going not feeling very probiotic [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8976.98s)]
*  right, but you know if you exercise restraint, which I'm not sure I know that word but [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8980.74s)]
*  Yeah restraint [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8987.46s)]
*  Do you do anything to recover from hangover specifically do you have sort of a routine? [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8989.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah water just a lot of water the sauna [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8994.78s)]
*  Yeah, there's some stuff you'll drink some electrolytes, you know, I do the the old-school [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=8999.460000000001s)]
*  British, you know Baraka if I have to what's that? [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9005.02s)]
*  It's like a fizzy like a vitamin C multi-vitamin fizzy thing you drink with water, you know dissolves in the water [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9008.220000000001s)]
*  So it's just a vitamin sort of yeah. Yeah [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9014.42s)]
*  That's oh we have some yeah, there it is that work. Yeah. Well, I mean the best thing for a hangover is [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9017.539999999999s)]
*  Drinking heavily in the night before then you'll for sure get a hangover [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9024.539999999999s)]
*  If you want to avoid the hangover don't drink heavily the night before it just is what it is [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9028.02s)]
*  this is what it is, so, you know just [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9033.3s)]
*  exercise restraint and [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9035.9s)]
*  drink a lot of water [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9038.5s)]
*  When you're drinking [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9040.3s)]
*  Like if I'm gonna have the tequilas, I have to force myself to be double-fisted [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9041.939999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9045.94s)]
*  Water in one hand drinking the other so that way I'm [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9047.14s)]
*  Hydrating as I'm drinking right so because this is a lot of it's the it's the dehydration that's fucking with you [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9051.18s)]
*  so that's why the electrolytes in the next morning help and [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9057.86s)]
*  Just you know pounding water [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9061.78s)]
*  During the process just in the process and the next day resign yourself to the fact you're gonna pee a lot. Yes [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9064.02s)]
*  Yeah, yes [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9069.22s)]
*  Do you have a hard time keeping up with the demand? [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9070.86s)]
*  Because I would imagine [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9073.74s)]
*  You can only grow so much wine. Yeah. Yeah, we're doing we're doing great with respect to that [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9075.74s)]
*  We're right. We're at the balance of what we can produce and what and what we sell [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9080.82s)]
*  It's a nice. It's a nice spot to be in [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9084.619999999999s)]
*  So you're like at that, but do you feel pressure to expand? [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9086.98s)]
*  We want it we want to expand because a healthy wine region has a healthy bulk wine market [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9090.74s)]
*  So if I can make wine out of all those grapes, but I only need [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9097.939999999999s)]
*  80% of it I sell my 20% of juice to other [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9102.26s)]
*  winemakers [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9107.42s)]
*  Just so they can supplement their programs. That's a that's a healthy and winemaking environment [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9108.9s)]
*  Like the you're familiar with that the wine the prisoner. No, okay [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9114.38s)]
*  You know the prisoner Oh the one that has like the mugshots on it. No, that's it's got a guy in chains [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9118.74s)]
*  It's a it's a it's a very popular [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9124.14s)]
*  Bottle of wine called the prisoner you know for the most part that was all [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9127.38s)]
*  Bullpoint that's a California project that took off that made [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9132.22s)]
*  fucking [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9136.619999999999s)]
*  distributors and people [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9137.82s)]
*  That's a shitload of money because it was a person was just basically going around initially to just get [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9139.02s)]
*  Bulk wine from all these different houses that had bulk wine that put a cool blend together, and it was priced perfectly and [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9145.619999999999s)]
*  You know wholesalers made a shitload of money on that thing because it was it was a [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9153.34s)]
*  It was it hit but it was bulk warning. It wasn't some weirdo like me in a cellar making wine [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9157.9s)]
*  Hmm [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9166.02s)]
*  So the that's the person that doesn't actually even own a vineyard they're just getting there's a lot of that like in California [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9168.1s)]
*  There's like people that don't own a vineyard don't even own a winery [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9174.539999999999s)]
*  They're just like putting together in a house or doing a they're producing a blend of wine from from [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9176.86s)]
*  bulk wines and presenting you a bottle and which is totally fine because it's [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9183.460000000001s)]
*  As long as it's labeled properly, that's a California red wine. Okay, that's that's fine [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9188.900000000001s)]
*  No, though what it's gonna taste like they're putting together there because they're they're only buying it if it goes with the blend [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9194.62s)]
*  So they're getting samples sample samples blending and then picking the samples the blend [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9201.02s)]
*  Buying that wine in bulk and putting it together [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9207.02s)]
*  Is this the most you've ever talked about one in the two and a half hour period? [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9210.34s)]
*  No, I can go I can go for a long time. I can bore the fuck. I can put you all to sleep. No, it's fascinating [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9214.140000000001s)]
*  I'm fascinated by I'm fascinated by anything that anybody is like deeply interested in and it's clear that you're deeply interested in this [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9221.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so to answer your question, I wouldn't mind expanding the vineyard so that I have [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9228.300000000001s)]
*  Flexibility because what happens if I get hail and it takes out half my vineyards if I have way more than I need [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9232.34s)]
*  Then I can kind of in that year. I can kind of massage what I have [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9238.78s)]
*  Maybe use bulk wine from the year before to supplement into a blend [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9242.66s)]
*  But if I'm if I've made all the grapes from the vineyard, we didn't get whether [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9246.22s)]
*  That wine is always valuable to somebody else to sell as a bulk product. Hail can take out half of your oh, yeah [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9250.34s)]
*  It fucking it sucks is there a way you can mitigate that but helps over [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9257.36s)]
*  Yeah, hail netting. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So like it looks like bird netting, but it's hailing that it's so so it serves two purposes [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9263.24s)]
*  Combats the hail and birds [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9271.12s)]
*  Jesus expensive and looks weird [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9275.12s)]
*  There it is. Hail. Yeah fuck look at that [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9279.0s)]
*  And that was destroys everything the well those vines are probably if they're not dead completely [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9283.42s)]
*  They're definitely not getting any grapes off those vines for the next three years. Oh my god [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9287.98s)]
*  Yeah, and it could very well be that those vines are done done done [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9293.34s)]
*  I'm just overwhelmed by the amount of commitments involved in this and just I start thinking about my own head like how I would handle this [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9299.42s)]
*  I'm like I just I [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9305.76s)]
*  Couldn't tequila. Mmm [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9307.94s)]
*  Something hey we got hail [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9310.78s)]
*  Listen man, you balance it out. I don't know how you do it [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9317.02s)]
*  It's uh, I think we kind of got a better perspective on what's involved for this comp through this conversation [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9319.94s)]
*  But I don't know how you do it [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9326.460000000001s)]
*  It's a lot. No, I don't do it by myself [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9328.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I thought you know, we have to delegate and you have to have you have to trust trust people [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9331.18s)]
*  So if somebody wants to buy your wine, what's the best retail outlet? [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9337.220000000001s)]
*  Caduceus org is our is our website. You can go buy it off of Caduceus org and we ship to most states [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9341.26s)]
*  We're only in distribution and maybe [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9348.060000000001s)]
*  12 or 14 states you couldn't get it at a grocery store unless we're actually in that state, Texas [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9350.74s)]
*  We're in we're in stores here in Texas [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9355.380000000001s)]
*  Colorado, you know like Colorado, Arizona, California [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9358.94s)]
*  But the best way to get it is just to order it offline [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9362.62s)]
*  All right, that's what if you want to review you have to ask [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9365.539999999999s)]
*  Drew Dober because I just sent him some wine. Oh really sent some to Drew. I love that dude [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9368.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we had we had a bet when I was last fight. I said if you win the fight [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9373.58s)]
*  I'll send you wine if you lose the fight [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9378.3s)]
*  You have to wear a shirt in public a caduceus shirt any shirt any shirt. Well any fuck I don't feel like him [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9380.3s)]
*  I wouldn't wear shirts. No, I'm so jealous of this fucking [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9385.66s)]
*  That was the Terrence McKinney fight right yeah, that was a wild fight it was a good fight [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9389.82s)]
*  Oh, that was a crazy one. That was that Terrence McKinney is wild. Did you see the the sugar Sean fight? [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9395.34s)]
*  Yes, I did. Yeah the look on his face at the end [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9401.859999999999s)]
*  He's I was like he normally runs his mouth pretty good as a good old Arizona boy [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9404.679999999998s)]
*  but like he had that look on his face like I [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9408.539999999999s)]
*  Did I win that did I win like he's well, he was very honest. He said I'm gonna have to watch this [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9411.34s)]
*  Yeah afterwards to see if I actually won it yeah, a lot of people were shocked. Yeah [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9416.34s)]
*  There's a video of Khabib watching the decision and [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9422.98s)]
*  Could be just like how how yeah, how how did he win? How yeah? [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9427.099999999999s)]
*  I yeah, I was I was right there 50. I wasn't I wasn't sure because I thought the other guy won but I [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9432.14s)]
*  Think the bigger takeaway is that? [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9439.5s)]
*  He was in it [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9441.86s)]
*  Oh, he was certainly in it against Pielter Jan who was a former champion one of the best [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9443.86s)]
*  Yeah in the division by far the number one contender. It was a very close fight, and he definitely hurt Pielter in [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9447.7s)]
*  Multiple occasions caught him with that big knee rocked him [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9454.02s)]
*  The question is how much is the takedown worth how much is control worth right? [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9457.5s)]
*  My I assume that when I saw all the takedowns like then then Yan won because there's a lot of takedowns [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9464.06s)]
*  Yeah, but takedowns without damage. It's like what is that? [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9469.94s)]
*  I mean, and I'm not now [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9473.54s)]
*  I'm not denying that I thought Pielter Jan won because I did think he won at the end of it [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9475.42s)]
*  but takedowns without damage versus stand up with damage because [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9479.82s)]
*  sugar landed more strikes standing and [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9484.58s)]
*  Had big moments Jan had some big moments to one big left hand that rocked him. The question is like [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9488.460000000001s)]
*  how much is the [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9494.66s)]
*  How valuable are those takedowns and how valuable is that top game and that control and that's that's way out of my you know [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9497.3s)]
*  The problem there's several problems [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9504.44s)]
*  But one of the problems is that I feel and I've said this ad nauseum that I feel that we were very limited by this 10 [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9506.34s)]
*  Nine this 10 10-point must scoring system [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9512.14s)]
*  Because someone could win of around 10 9 and it can be a very close round and someone can win win around [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9515.9s)]
*  Clearly and it could be 10 9 right and that doesn't make any sense to me [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9522.7s)]
*  The system is designed for boxing and it's a good system for boxing [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9527.66s)]
*  I don't think it's a good system for MMA. I think MMA needs a much more comprehensive system [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9533.26s)]
*  Like if a guy can hold you down with no damage at all for three minutes [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9538.82s)]
*  Versus a guy who holds you down and damages you for 30 seconds. What's worth more? [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9544.34s)]
*  You know what hits you with three or four good hard shots [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9549.06s)]
*  Is that worth more or is like the predominance of a relic if you spend the majority of a round on top of a guy [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9551.62s)]
*  Even if you're not damaging him, how much is that worth? [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9558.94s)]
*  What are how much is a leg kick worth? How much is a submission worth like a submission attempt? [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9561.9s)]
*  I think we need a much more comprehensive system that it doesn't it's not 10-point must [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9567.539999999999s)]
*  I don't think that's the right system for for MMA. I think it should be a completely different system [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9573.78s)]
*  We just sort of adopted the boxing system. So like the first round of Al Jemaine Sterling and TJ Dillashaw [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9578.640000000001s)]
*  I mean that is a fucking dominant round. Like what is that? Is it a 10-7? Is it a 10-6? [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9585.04s)]
*  I mean, that's an all Al Jemaine round [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9590.2s)]
*  He beat the shit out of TJ Dillashaw took him down dominated him took his back beat the fuck out of him [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9592.800000000001s)]
*  Like what's that? How do you score that round? And you know, how could you know, how could that be better scored? [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9599.04s)]
*  With a better system, right? I think there's there's definitely one I can feel like that that UFC was probably my top five [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9606.4s)]
*  UFC's ever it was amazing. We watched it [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9614.12s)]
*  Jamie hooked it up from my iPad to a television through an HDMI connection in the O2 arena [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9617.84s)]
*  We're in London. We just did the show. We had no idea what happened. Luckily. We got off stage ordered food and [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9625.24s)]
*  Jamie set up the iPad to a big-screen TV that was in the room. We're all in there [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9632.16s)]
*  It was like 20 of us in there watching it was a day now. It was incredible. He'll sue you. No, he wanted me to [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9636.52s)]
*  The link to it I have a fight pass [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9644.32s)]
*  membership, but that's how we watched it, but it was such a good fight and then [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9647.2s)]
*  Watching Islam and and Charles Olivera. That was what a fight that was [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9652.52s)]
*  I [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9658.160000000002s)]
*  Islam Makachev must have the most incredible squeeze [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9659.36s)]
*  His his squeeze must be out of this world because you see how quick Charles tapped once he clamped that on him. I mean, whoo [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9663.68s)]
*  Yeah, he had all the points covered and he just like yeah that dude is on another level [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9672.08s)]
*  I mean, I am he is the truth [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9678.960000000001s)]
*  I am so I was always impressed with him [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9681.84s)]
*  But I mean I was saying leading up to him getting a shot at the world title, he's the boogeyman in that division [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9683.92s)]
*  He was the guy that everybody was saying like is the most dominant of all the contenders [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9690.8s)]
*  And then when he tapped over that was a big one when he tapped Dan Hooker. That was a big one, too [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9694.92s)]
*  It's like the way he's tapping these guys who are these world-class fighters. He's just fucking running through him [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9699.7s)]
*  but the fact that he got on Olivera and [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9705.4s)]
*  Mounted him and then submitted him with an arm triangle head and arm choke like that [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9708.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's a statement whoo [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9714.4s)]
*  he submitted the guy with the most submissions in the history of the sport and [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9716.68s)]
*  The way he did it was just he's so fucking methodical and dominant and Olivera tested him [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9720.84s)]
*  I mean he got out of bad positions in the first round got back up to his feet [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9727.2s)]
*  Hit him with some good shots, but Makachev. He's the fucking truth [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9732.04s)]
*  You know there's and [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9736.44s)]
*  Interesting that he's gonna fight Volkanovsky next that's kind of a crazy thing for Volkanovsky to go right up to 55 from 45 [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9738.6s)]
*  Yeah, I [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9746.24s)]
*  Don't know you know I'm interested in that because Volkanovsky is he's fucking amazing [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9748.76s)]
*  I mean the fights with Holloway, especially the last fight with Holloway [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9754.12s)]
*  We see the evolution of his game, and he's gotten so much better [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9757.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9762.800000000001s)]
*  An iPad on stage with you sometimes oh, yeah, why are you playing watching the fights? Yeah? [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9765.32s)]
*  Because I want to know I mean [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9771.8s)]
*  Of course it's it's fighter specific these people that I definitely pay attention to more than other fighters [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9773.64s)]
*  just because I want to see what happens because [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9778.699999999999s)]

*  Young guy and if Jake Paul was just a boxer and not a youtuber [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9968.119999999999s)]
*  I think people would take him very seriously right and I think people for whatever reason think that he I think you have to take [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9972.599999999999s)]

*  Anderson Silva is one of the greatest combat sports athletes of all time one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time and as a boxer [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9984.64s)]
*  Even though he's 47 years old. He did beat Julio Cesar Chavez jr [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9992.96s)]
*  Who was a legitimate former world champion and he knocked out Tito Ortiz to show you that he's got power [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=9997.32s)]
*  Obviously Tito is not a boxer. I'm curious [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10003.84s)]
*  I'm curious. I don't know what's gonna happen. It's 47 is old because for me there's there's there's the UFC and then there's Anderson Silva [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10007.28s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm you know, I'm very precious about [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10014.88s)]
*  Anderson well, I as a fan was very fortunate to be able to commentate against [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10018.08s)]
*  While excuse me when Anderson was competing in his prime against the best in the world when Anderson was in his prime [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10024.08s)]
*  He was a magician [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10031.24s)]
*  He was spectacular to see him fight in his prime like when he knocked out Vitor with that front kick to the face [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10033.8s)]
*  When when Anderson beat Chael Sonnen with a triangle in the last round a fight that he was losing when he was [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10040.919999999998s)]
*  Losing when he just beat the shit out of him in the rematch [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10047.2s)]
*  Anderson during his prime was something extraordinary [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10050.640000000001s)]
*  He really [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10054.400000000001s)]
*  He for people forget because you see him towards the decline [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10055.960000000001s)]
*  After he got his leg broken by Chris Weidman in that fight. He was never really the same again [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10061.6s)]
*  but if you remember like you should look at a fighter and in terms of like what they were what they were when they were at [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10066.52s)]
*  their best and [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10073.640000000001s)]
*  Anderson at his best was one of the greatest if not the greatest of all time. He was amazing [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10075.48s)]
*  He was fucking amazing when he was in his prime [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10080.96s)]
*  Yeah, I had friends that would like watch the fights with me and they're going what is he doing? [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10083.64s)]
*  Like he's not doing anything to first night. He said he is he is testing every single fucking boundary [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10087.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, now to figure out what he's gonna do in the second round and then he's downloading data downloading data [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10094.32s)]
*  I'm gonna be like this see what he does and we go like this see what he does [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10100.1s)]
*  Like this see what he does. He was extraordinary [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10102.560000000001s)]
*  Second round boink. I was a fan of his before he ever got to the UFC and I remember [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10106.32s)]
*  There was a betting line when he was fighting Chris Liebman and I was like whatever the betting line has put the fucking house on [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10111.76s)]
*  The Brazilian Mike you have to understand what you're about to see like this guy is on [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10118.28s)]
*  Many different levels he is and he was in his prime because I was watching him compete [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10122.560000000001s)]
*  He was initially competing in Japan and then he started competing in London in in England and [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10127.640000000001s)]
*  It was a cage rage. I think it was called that in that promotion was when he came into his own [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10133.480000000001s)]
*  That's when he fought Lee Murray. That's when he fought [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10139.18s)]
*  George Olivera he he was in his prime then and that's when he came to the UFC right after that [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10142.640000000001s)]
*  I'm like this when he fought Tony Fricklin and he hit him with this like preposterous upward elbow [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10148.800000000001s)]
*  He was so good and I was like we're getting [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10154.32s)]
*  Anderson like when he came into his own and that's when he entered into the UFC so people got to see this like [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10157.279999999999s)]
*  Just perfect striker. He was so good [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10164.0s)]
*  But he's 47, you know, that's so when I'm looking at this fight coming up. I'm like, hmm. I don't know [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10167.519999999999s)]
*  He's also 47 and I don't know what kind of testing they're doing [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10172.96s)]
*  Right that changes everything that changes the whole world because if he's on all sorts of Mexican supplements [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10177.48s)]
*  Then we could see like a turning back of the clock extra mustache [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10183.72s)]
*  Yes, could have an extra mustache. He's most likely going to be [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10188.6s)]
*  Supplementing I wouldn't imagine he's not at 47 [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10194.08s)]
*  I would wouldn't imagine he's not taking something if you're taking something in your 47 [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10198.08s)]
*  That is not what we think of as 47 that is 47 with a body that responds like a 30 year old [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10203.359999999999s)]
*  Is that the case? I don't know. Is that enough? I don't know. I'm interested [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10209.08s)]
*  I'm in I'm gonna watch it. I'm definitely gonna get it. Yeah, you know, even if it's on stage [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10213.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah, right over here. Yeah, I didn't do that. I did I couldn't do that. I couldn't it was comedy [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10219.24s)]
*  I can't do that true. I can't but but afterwards [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10224.640000000001s)]
*  I'm like I just gotta stay away from my phone and get to the iPad and watch it [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10228.08s)]
*  Yeah, but it's um, you know, it's an amazing time to be a fan of combat sports. There's so much going on. I [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10232.68s)]
*  agree [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10239.84s)]

*  Like to have it this popular [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10262.4s)]
*  It's not a coincidence that it's this popular while Gordon Ryan is at his peak [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10264.28s)]

*  Cutting cutting off all your fucking exits and [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8TXWPFHGQ&t=10298.28s)]
