# Joe Rogan Experience #1363 - Dakota Meyer
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 08, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlDUYhZvU9s)
*  What's up, Dakota?
*  We finally did this.
*  I know.
*  Finally, we've been talking about it.
*  I feel super connected to you, man, because all day I've been listening to you on Jaco's
*  podcast.
*  First of all, anybody who really wants to know you in depth, in your element, talking
*  with a fellow warrior, I strongly recommend that podcast.
*  For people who don't ... What number is it?
*  Do you know which number?
*  I don't know what number it is.
*  I was just listening to it.
*  It's Jaco Podcast 115, Into the Fire and Beyond the Call of Duty.
*  Jaco is a fucking beast and you two together talking about the incidents that happen with
*  you overseas, it's insane.
*  I had to call Buddy, I had to stop the podcast and call my friend Brendan just to talk to
*  him.
*  This is so intense.
*  I was driving, I was getting nervous.
*  Driving in my Tesla, my little electric car, I'm driving, my hands are sweating and I'm
*  breathing heavy.
*  I'm like, fuck.
*  If you hear all those ... When you're listening to that podcast, that was by far the most ... Jaco
*  just pulled it out of me.
*  Most everybody hits the high points of it, but me and Jaco just made that connection.
*  It was the first time we'd ever met.
*  Face to face, yeah.
*  We just went ... He actually picked me up from the airport and we went there and we
*  sat down and did the podcast.
*  I don't know.
*  I think he knew the questions to ask because I think it was good for both of us because
*  if you got to the point in the middle of it, if you start hearing those silences, it was
*  both of us trying to keep from tears falling.
*  It was like that moment you're trying to ... We really connected and it was a tough podcast.
*  You could tell because for Jaco ... I listen to a lot of Jaco's podcasts, but that was
*  one where he was really in his element.
*  First of all, it's very obviously as a deep respect for you and who you are and what you
*  stand for.
*  Then two, it brought him back to his own experiences more.
*  The whole thing is just ... It's one of the most intense podcasts I've ever listened to
*  if not the most intense.
*  It's fucking heavy, man.
*  It was heavy.
*  It was a hard one.
*  Like you said, I think we both ... I think Jaco was getting as much out of it as I was.
*  I have the utmost respect for Jaco.
*  The guy is just ... He's the epitome of a warrior all around from day in and day out.
*  He wakes up every day and lives the things that he says.
*  He does what he says and he lives it and he puts people first.
*  He's one of the greatest guys I've ever met.
*  I agree.
*  I couldn't have said it better.
*  And Tim Kennedy as well.
*  We're both friends with Tim and the same thing.
*  It's a rare human being, both of those guys.
*  It is.
*  I think that's what I'm so fortunate about is I'm surrounded by just people like that.
*  I'm so fortunate to have a circle like that.
*  I think that that's what makes us who we are.
*  That's the true ... The epitome is iron sharpens iron.
*  When you're surrounded by guys like Jaco and Tim Kennedy and you have no option, but even
*  if you're last in that group, you're still above average.
*  Well there's a cliche that comes up when people talk about military.
*  People will say things ... Sometimes it's hard to understand whether or not they grasp
*  exactly what they're saying, but that people make sacrifices so that you can be free.
*  I don't think people ... It's hard to truly internalize that without having experienced
*  what you've experienced, what Jaco and Tim Kennedy have experienced.
*  When I'm listening to it, I know that it's correct.
*  I know that it's true.
*  I support it 100%, but it's almost like an alien thing to me because I've never experienced
*  it.
*  So when hearing you guys talk about it and climbing inside your head for a bit and listen
*  to you describe it, that cliche, the land of the free because of the brave.
*  It gets highlighted where you understand this is why America's not like it is in other places
*  because of this strong military.
*  One of the things you guys talked about in that podcast was this idea of us invading
*  Afghanistan.
*  You were fighting alongside Afghans.
*  Absolutely.
*  Most people who talk about war will have this peripheral sort of cursory understanding about
*  what they would like the world to be like.
*  They would like no war and that this is terrible.
*  We shouldn't be over there.
*  They don't truly understand what you understand.
*  They don't.
*  I think the perspective that I get to come back and I think all these guys telling their
*  stories from Rob O'Neill to Mark Luttrell, I think every warrior out there has to tell
*  their story to make people understand.
*  It's so important for that because we've got a perspective of the world that a lot of people
*  don't get.
*  I stood next to people that we couldn't ... You talk about not believing, not being raised,
*  not coming from the same place.
*  We could have found every reason not to be on the same ground, but we stood next to each
*  other and we're willing to die for each other.
*  We found, we chose to find the common denominator and that was because there's only two types
*  of people in this world.
*  There's good and evil.
*  Yes.
*  It really comes down to that.
*  Life is so simple.
*  When you try to complicate it, there's other reasons.
*  It's like this whole thing.
*  We were all over there fighting for the belief to be free, this belief of democracy, this
*  belief of what we all live for.
*  You can't see it, but we live it every day and we were willing to give our lives for
*  people we didn't even know, people we didn't even meet.
*  One of the things you talked about with Jaco, you said you didn't just lose four brothers
*  that day, you lost 10 because you lost six Afghani brothers as well.
*  The Afghans were as close to me as the Marines were.
*  My team of Afghan soldiers ... I lived on a base, it was four US and 80 Afghans.
*  Every day I went out on patrol and I'm patrolling with them and they're no different than me
*  and you.
*  They just want a place ... I'll never forget that it really hit home to me.
*  I had an Afghan, we were sitting up on the mountain ... actually the cover of my book,
*  it was that day.
*  We were sitting on that mountain because we had chased some Taliban up that hill.
*  We were sitting up there and this Afghan looked at me and he just said, I hope that someday
*  you can bring your family here on vacation.
*  I hope that we can get it to that point.
*  Wow.
*  It really hit home to me.
*  We're all just alike.
*  We're all just alike.
*  We all just want to live a great life and we all just want to get along.
*  If you don't get along, it's because you choose not to get along.
*  For people who don't understand the conflict in Afghanistan, explain what is happening
*  and why we're over there.
*  Basically Afghanistan, and it was the same thing in Iraq too.
*  That's where these terrorist organizations were.
*  We're over there fighting alongside Afghanistan.
*  We're over there fighting alongside Iraq.
*  We're not fighting Iraq and fighting Afghanistan.
*  We're fighting alongside both of those countries and trying to rebuild it up and trying to
*  get rid of these terrorist cells that are inside those countries.
*  Like you said, everybody thinks that we're fighting Iraq and we're fighting Afghanistan.
*  It's not the case.
*  We're alongside them helping them rebuild their countries.
*  When you go to Black Rifle Coffee in Salt Lake, those guys are awesome.
*  They brought a bunch of former Afghani troops over and they work for them over there.
*  A lot of the guys working in the factory.
*  You're like, oh, okay.
*  These guys are so close to these people, they brought them back and gave them jobs in America.
*  I just think most people don't really have a full picture of what's at stake and why
*  it's even happening.
*  They just don't want war.
*  They just don't want war, but it's like, there's no way you can go in your house and
*  lock your doors and sit there and try to pretend that the evil that we fight doesn't exist,
*  but it exists.
*  It exists.
*  It's there.
*  It's there.
*  If we don't go fight it over there, it's going to come here.
*  That's another cliche that seems alien to people.
*  It's a true statement.
*  It's always been true throughout human history.
*  When you live in a country like America, we're so fortunate.
*  It's so awesome here.
*  Even when it sucks, it's awesome.
*  In comparison to the rest of the world, it's very rare that you have a place where you
*  really can start at the bottom and make your way up to be a successful person.
*  I mean, literally you can start here and come from nothing and within your generation be
*  the president of the United States.
*  You could literally start from that and it's the only country on the face of the planet.
*  I tell people all the time, just because we get so caught up, right now is an emotional
*  time for America.
*  It's getting ready to ... I call it the draining time.
*  From now until November, until the election time, it's going to be draining.
*  Everybody's getting so emotional and fired up.
*  It's like, it's going to be whatever.
*  The cool part is that this country, from all of us in the military, from all our first
*  responders, our police officers, we're the only country on the face of the planet that
*  doesn't swear allegiance to a person.
*  We swear allegiance to a document, to a piece of paper.
*  That's what allows us to be us.
*  That's what allows us to not have one person come in and be able to change up this idea
*  that we have of democracy, of freedom.
*  That's something that's just ... It's incredible.
*  That's what keeps our country the way it is.
*  The people will always be in charge here.
*  You know what?
*  Most of America, 99% of America is incredible.
*  It's incredible.
*  You know what?
*  They're stopping and they're helping people.
*  It's just the loud ones that make it look like it's all chaotic.
*  People love to point out the horrible aspects and they love to ignore the good aspects.
*  They love to dwell on the bad parts.
*  Ultimately, that's going to prove to be good for everybody because those people that are
*  highlighting all these bad things, then everybody else has to think about it and will slowly
*  but surely evolve and come to an understanding and make the world a better place.
*  It's a way better place now than it was 100 years ago or 200 years ago.
*  Steven Pinker talks about this all the time in his books.
*  He's criticized for it because a lot of people don't like the idea that things are getting
*  better.
*  They want to dwell on the negative aspects.
*  They want to magnify those and make it the most important focal point.
*  I think the most important focal point if we want to have a good world is concentrate
*  on the good aspects and how amazing it really is that we have this incredible ability to
*  express ourselves, this incredible ability to prosper, to move.
*  People don't get the same share or the same stake in life.
*  A lot of people get a terrible opening hand of cards.
*  You can improve.
*  This is one of the rare places in the world where you can.
*  If you're so inclined, if you have the discipline, if you can figure it out emotionally, if you
*  can figure it out in terms of what you want to do in your life, you can live a healthy
*  and successful life in this country.
*  It's possible.
*  It's 100%.
*  100%.
*  Nobody's holding you down.
*  You have the choice to be able to do that.
*  You have the choice to go out.
*  Every opportunity is here.
*  There's no other country that has more opportunities than the United States of America, especially
*  for anybody.
*  I agree with you.
*  I think that society has gotten into this place of where we're trying to out victimize
*  each other.
*  Who can be the bigger victim?
*  Who's had it harder?
*  The thing that I also believe is that with technology and all this is the empathy, suffering
*  has become normal for people.
*  It's become entertainment.
*  Look at reality TV.
*  People's messed up lives.
*  That's entertainment for people now.
*  Video games.
*  I talk about this all the time about war.
*  We came back and war has now been romanticized.
*  It's been romanticized that it's this cool image of, I hear people say, I just want to
*  go kick indoors and shoot people in the face.
*  It's like, well, you've probably never done it then.
*  It's like we've got our kids playing video games of the stuff that keeps me awake at
*  night.
*  At what point do we start humanizing these things?
*  When you see one of those crazy video games, those first person shooters involving war,
*  does that bring back memories?
*  Does it irritate you?
*  I think that what's not put out there is I hear kids talking about, hey, did you use
*  this or did you use this?
*  You hear people say, well, did you kill somebody?
*  It's like kids.
*  To me, that bothers me because there's nothing cool about taking another human's life.
*  When you're playing video games and it's like, oh, I got this many kills, these kids are
*  just watching this screen over and over.
*  And the more graphic it gets, the less desensitized that we have to another human being suffering.
*  The more desensitized we are.
*  Yeah, desensitized.
*  The more desensitized and then you start, the more the movies go.
*  I think that we've pushed ourselves away from being empathetic to, hey, these are real people.
*  These are real people's lives.
*  We've stopped looking at people and saying, this is someone's child.
*  This is someone's mother.
*  This is someone's son.
*  We've gotten away from that.
*  The old art that I was always told to live by is treat someone as you would want to be
*  treated yourself.
*  And if you were in those shoes, and every time I pass somebody, every time I see somebody
*  suffering, I always look at that and be like, well, what would I want somebody to do if
*  they see my daughter suffering or my son suffering?
*  I mean, look at all these times I see these people holding their video cameras up in their
*  video and somebody getting just beat.
*  And it's like, how do you do that and not help?
*  How does that not just suck everything out of you to not want to do something?
*  Yeah, there's a thing called diffusion of responsibility that happens to people in crowds,
*  unfortunately.
*  The same thing that I think when you're filming something that's happening in real life is
*  the same thing that you've seen in these video games and on television shows.
*  We have never had more violence in film form and in video game form ever.
*  But yet we've never had less violence violence.
*  How many people who play these games that have seen people get shot over and over and
*  over and over again have never seen a body, never seen anybody get severely wounded or
*  shot.
*  And so to them, getting shot and shooting people is always it's almost like empty.
*  It's like bang, bang, bang.
*  There's the guy comes out of the budges, bang, bang, bang.
*  You shoot him.
*  Here comes this guy.
*  Bang, bang, bang.
*  You shoot him.
*  And it doesn't feel like anything.
*  And then you shut it off and you have a sandwich and you turn it on again.
*  You do it again.
*  So you're you're experiencing this thing that's empty.
*  It's like you're pretending to drink water, but there's nothing in the glass.
*  You just keep doing it over and over again.
*  And then you get some real water and you're like, oh, this is this is different.
*  Yeah, this is this is not even a good.
*  That's a terrible analogy.
*  But the analogy of numbing that people are numb to this fake violence and have no experience
*  with the real stuff.
*  So they think of the real stuff the same way they think of the fake stuff.
*  They do.
*  And then, you know, and sometimes when they see it, they still are numb.
*  They still can't act right.
*  Like they still don't.
*  It's kind of like it's kind of like imagine the way I look at it is, you know, you look
*  at all these simulators like flight simulators.
*  I mean, there's all this virtual reality, right, that people are using this for actually
*  training.
*  And so, like, you don't think that it's the same way when you're doing this.
*  And then you've got games that come out like Grand Theft Auto, right, like where you're
*  just running around and you're shooting hookers, running like, like, how does that how is that
*  eat? How is anything positive come from that?
*  Right, right.
*  How is it?
*  Yeah, it's we're a weird culture.
*  And then weird.
*  You could see all the violence you want.
*  Like I watched John Wick three last night.
*  I finally finished it.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Three quarters of the way through.
*  I'm like, how many fucking people have they killed?
*  This is so ridiculous.
*  Yeah. It's just a murder fest.
*  It's murder porn.
*  That's what it's like.
*  Isn't it? Kind of.
*  Yeah. But the crazy thing is like that kind of violence is unheard of.
*  But yet you don't show sex.
*  Like you could show people's brains exploding.
*  But if you showed a girl's pussy and a penis going inside of it, people get that on the
*  air. The one thing that doesn't hurt anybody that everybody wants.
*  That would be horrific to show.
*  Like if you had a film with, you know, Brad Pitt and give me a hot woman actress, Jamie,
*  you know, hot women actresses.
*  Who's Scarlett Johansson?
*  OK, Scarlett Johansson and Brad Pitt have a sex scene and they actually fucking get
*  after it. And you see it and you see her feet up in the air.
*  You'd be like, what are we watching?
*  This is crazy. But yet you could see Brad Pitt.
*  Spoiler alert. If you see that once upon a time in Hollywood, is that the name of it?
*  The Quintet. He beats a woman to death, smashing her face against a mantle of a fucking
*  fireplace. And you're like, holy fuck.
*  And that's OK. That's OK.
*  That's OK. But just fucking.
*  Dush! Dush!
*  And you're like, whoa, that's fine.
*  That's fine. That's fine.
*  But if you fuck Scarlett Johansson, you saw her asshole.
*  You'd be like, what? I see her actual asshole.
*  This is crazy. Get this up.
*  You should go to jail.
*  It's weird. Yeah.
*  Things that everybody wants to do.
*  Like we all want sex.
*  Everybody likes sex.
*  Everybody likes sex. But so.
*  You know, nobody likes beating someone to death with their fucking head off a mantle.
*  I mean, that's a daughter to that somebody's daughter.
*  Fucking we're weird, bro.
*  We're so weird. We are weird.
*  Yeah. When you look at it like that.
*  So weird. So weird.
*  Do you know how outrageous it would be if Scarlett Johansson and Brad Pitt had an actual sex scene in a movie?
*  They just fucked. They said, listen, I like her.
*  She likes me. Let's do this.
*  Yeah. And she was like, let's do it.
*  Fuck it. I'm ready.
*  I'm ready to method act.
*  That actually happened in a movie called Brown Bunny.
*  It was a long time ago.
*  There was a movie with Vincent Gallo and there was an actress.
*  Her name is Chloe.
*  I forget how you say her name.
*  Svengy. How do you say it?
*  Savengy.
*  She's a really good actress and he's a really good actor.
*  And for whatever reason, they decided to do a sex scene where she gives him a real blowjob.
*  And everybody who saw it in the theater was angry.
*  All these critics were angry.
*  They're like, this is fucking outrageous.
*  This is terrible. And it really killed his career.
*  I mean, it killed her career a little bit, too, I think.
*  Definitely derailed it, but it fucking killed his career.
*  Yeah. Everybody thought he's a creep after that.
*  It's weird.
*  A creep like a creep for something that everybody's done.
*  Right. But meanwhile, everybody loves Keanu Reeves and he's like,
*  he's shooting people in the neck and the asshole in the face and the eyeballs in the mouth.
*  He's cutting them up and stabbing them and throwing them off motorcycles like, fuck.
*  That's OK, though. That's OK.
*  That's OK. But Vincent Gallo actually getting a legitimate blowjob.
*  That's outrageous.
*  That guy should be pulled out of Hollywood forever.
*  Dunny's terrible.
*  Who wants a blowjob?
*  Yeah. It's weird.
*  Like, we get freaked out about watching people do something that everybody wants to do.
*  It's it's insane. Very weird.
*  Yeah, it's insane.
*  And yeah, super weird.
*  Oh, that's funny.
*  What do you got, Jamie?
*  He he produced, edited, directed cinematography of the video.
*  Yeah, it was his idea to get his dick sucked.
*  He made the whole thing.
*  I know. He did make the whole thing.
*  Like a self-produced sex tape.
*  Try getting somebody else to do it.
*  Try getting someone like, hey, in this scene, how about she actually sucks my dick for real?
*  Oh, Vincent. No, no, no. Really.
*  No, for real. Let's do this.
*  Everybody would be like, get the fuck out of here.
*  He probably had to film it and not let anybody know what was happening until after it was over.
*  The crazy thing is he talked her into it.
*  You imagine she'd be like, wait, what the fuck did you just say?
*  But he talked her into it and she went with it.
*  But that would be fine.
*  But, you know, there's a scene in Apocalypse Now
*  where there's a water buffalo and they kill the water buffalo with a machete.
*  They used a real water buffalo and a real machete.
*  They really killed the water buffalo for that scene.
*  And now people went nuts, I bet.
*  They went nuts and they go nuts now.
*  When people find out about now, they freak out.
*  Yeah, like I wouldn't like I mean, I wouldn't even post anything on my Instagram of hunting
*  because people would just tell you like, oh, we should we should we should hunt you.
*  We should shoot you with a bow and arrow.
*  I mean, yeah, you know, but but but they can go watch people get killed.
*  Mm hmm. No problem. No problem.
*  Yeah, I very rarely post things.
*  I posted the first elk I ever shot with a bow.
*  I posted a picture of that because I was it's hard work, man.
*  It was hard for me to do. I was proud of it.
*  It's difficult. And I was going to eat that elk for a year.
*  And I did eat it. You know, and to me, that meant a lot to me.
*  Like, this is how I'm getting my meat now.
*  This is my nutrition.
*  I'm going to feed my family with this.
*  But yeah, the comments are just ridiculous. They're ridiculous, right?
*  They just go crazy.
*  But hey, you know, that's their trip.
*  This is part of it. Yeah.
*  Their trip is save the animals.
*  Everybody's got their own.
*  It's interesting, like the only thing that gives them a sense of purpose
*  that makes them feel like they're doing something that makes a difference
*  and makes a change that matters.
*  Yeah. And for a lot of people, it's that like stop eating eggs.
*  Yeah. Stop eating eggs.
*  OK. Good luck with that.
*  My favorite is when they're rabid, fucking vicious, nasty vegans.
*  And then like eight years later, they give up.
*  They start eating fish.
*  And the next thing you know, they get hard on again.
*  And it's like it's just it doesn't last.
*  You know, it's so fucking hard to just eat only plants.
*  It's it's not the healthiest move for most people.
*  I mean, everybody, everybody varies biologically.
*  But for most people, it's not the healthiest move.
*  But you know, I mean, you got to give respect.
*  I mean, a vegan like you, that's discipline. Yes.
*  That's discipline. 100 percent.
*  Well, I've and I've friends that are vegan.
*  My friend, John Joseph, he's legit as fuck.
*  And he's he's been plant based for more than 20 years.
*  I think more than that. Right.
*  Thirty, maybe even 30 years.
*  He's an animal.
*  But for him, like it's part of his discipline that helped him clean up.
*  He was addicted to drugs.
*  It helped him.
*  You know, he's done 10 Iron Man's, you know, so.
*  And then a bunch of half Iron Man's as well.
*  So, like, you know, it's part of who he is as a man, like his discipline.
*  And part of his discipline applies to his diet.
*  Yeah. Being a vegan, it's something like I couldn't do.
*  You could do it. No, I'm sure you could.
*  You don't want to do it.
*  Well, you've done you can probably do anything that people can do.
*  You know, the way I justify it is, is like I'm I'm, you know,
*  I'm vegetarian through secondhand source.
*  Right. You're eating vegetarians.
*  Well, yeah, exactly. Yeah.
*  So let's just do a secondhand source.
*  Yeah. I don't think they count that.
*  It doesn't.
*  No, I don't think so.
*  You know, it's I don't know, man.
*  It's it's one of those things where even when I drink, it's from corn.
*  Right. So Anthony Bourdain used to get really angry about this.
*  And one of the things that he said was this is a first world problem.
*  He's like, we are so fortunate that we have this problem.
*  And in other countries, they're just trying to get enough protein
*  to feed their family.
*  They're just trying to get enough food to feed people.
*  You know, and he was it wasn't like he was indifferent to animals,
*  but he was deeply concerned about people and about, you know,
*  because of all this is traveling.
*  He had like a great deal of empathy for all these different people
*  in these different cultures and their cuisine.
*  And he did a tremendous amount of respect for it.
*  Like he would talk about it like it was religious to him almost, you know.
*  Yeah, like, you know, when we would go into villages and eat,
*  I mean, if they if they had meat.
*  Like, that was a big deal.
*  Like if they if they brought meat out to you, then they, you know,
*  that was a huge deal. Yeah.
*  I mean, you look at it and it's just like, gosh, you know, we we, you know,
*  we're over here complaining about stuff that that most countries
*  wish they had those problems like most 90 percent of stuff
*  we're complaining about.
*  Most countries wish they had those problems. Right.
*  But I get it.
*  The people don't want those problems to exist, too.
*  They want those problems to go away.
*  They want a utopia.
*  And the only way to build towards a utopia is to improve upon the problems
*  that we have. And we do have problems across the board.
*  But in comparison, I mean, just I would just love some perspective from people.
*  I would just love some.
*  And I think that would go a long way to help people have more happiness.
*  Well, I mean, but I mean, how do you wake up when all you do is focus on problems?
*  Right. Like it's kind of like, you know,
*  when you're when you're working or you're at a job, right, or you own a company.
*  Like everybody's you're always just fixing.
*  I call it putting out fires. Yeah.
*  And if that's all you do is constantly put out fires, like at what point
*  do you become grateful?
*  Like like at what point?
*  At what point of the day do people stop and look around? Right.
*  And they're grateful for what they have.
*  And they are appreciative of.
*  I had a guy tell me, you know, when I was going through my divorce,
*  I mean, I was I was a train wreck.
*  Just call Tim Kennedy and he'll tell you,
*  you know, I'll never forget a guy set me down.
*  I was talking about all these problems and just I mean,
*  just nitpicking and fighting over the small stuff.
*  And I mean, literally just, well, she worded it this way
*  and she needs to do it this way, like literally just every little thing.
*  And a guy finally set me down. He looked at me and he goes, look, Dakota,
*  he said, if you can make choices or decisions to change it,
*  then it's not a problem. It's an inconvenience.
*  The day that you can't make a choice, you've got cancer,
*  you're kids sick or something like that.
*  He goes, that's a day you got problems until then.
*  You just got inconveniences.
*  That's a great way to look at it.
*  Until then, you just got inconveniences.
*  And I was like, you're right.
*  That's a great way to look at it because there's levels of problems, right?
*  There's insurmountable problems, cancer, injuries, things,
*  things of that nature. Car accidents, insurmountable.
*  And you know what? And the thing is, I think, you know,
*  I think I'm so fortunate to have gone through the experiences that I have
*  because I, you know, each one of them, it's all perspective.
*  It changes my perspective on the way I look at things.
*  It changes the things that are important to me. I call it.
*  I always call it. Everybody's got their lens of life and that lens of life.
*  You know, your lens of life looks different than mine.
*  Mine looks different than yours. And it all we all have our own lens of life.
*  And at the point, you know, we get so focused and get into autopilot
*  and it'll focus on, you know, it's kind of like your camera.
*  You pull it up and you got on autofocus.
*  It never focuses on what you want it focused on, right?
*  Until you go back to the manual focus and you push where it's at.
*  And I feel like all these problems that we have are just made to,
*  hey, we need to tighten our lens back up to focus on what really, really, really matters.
*  Yeah. Well, I think sometimes people need to hear it from someone like you,
*  you know, or someone like Jaco or, you know, the beautiful thing about these podcasts
*  is that you get to hear people's perspective and a lot of them are eye opening.
*  You know, they they're they literally can change the world
*  because they change the way you behave and you interact with people when you listen to it.
*  And that podcast that you did with Jaco when I was listening to it,
*  it changed my whole day.
*  It changed like how I was going to look at my day.
*  I was, you know, instead of like looking at my day like, oh, it's a normal day.
*  I was thinking, God damn, I'm lucky.
*  God damn, I'm lucky.
*  And God damn, imagine experiencing what you and how old were you at the time?
*  I was 21, 21 years old and experiencing what you experienced
*  in that insane firefight being locked down.
*  And I mean, how many guys did you wind up engaging with?
*  I don't know.
*  I, you know, I don't know.
*  I mean, every one day I got an opportunity with right.
*  And it just, you know, it was just a.
*  You know, it's so chaotic.
*  I mean, I, you know, I still I look, I think about all the time, obviously.
*  It's something I could have never experienced.
*  I mean, I trained for war every single day when I was in the Marine Corps.
*  I mean, it was what it was, what my job was.
*  And I still could have never imagined that day the way it was or anything to turn out.
*  I could have never pictured it. I could have never.
*  And I think every day it goes by, I think there's a reckoning of it, right?
*  The way that I seen it that day is not the way I see it today.
*  And I think that comes with, you know, just just sharpening and just your body.
*  You know, you change and you see different things in perspective.
*  But yeah, I mean.
*  You know, I, you know, that day, I mean, it's still I mean, it's still it's just,
*  you know, just it's just there's so many lessons that come from that day that
*  you know, I look at people complaining about stuff here in America and it's like.
*  You know, I seen him one day, the best of humans, the worst of humans.
*  And everybody, nobody thought they were wrong.
*  And it's possible, you know, it's just it's just one of those deals of, you know,
*  that that day was just.
*  That's an important point we just said, nobody thought they were wrong, not them, not you.
*  Yeah, you know, I but and it changed me that day, like I walked in there that day
*  and I was the guy who was cocky, who would tell you, you know, I love fighting.
*  Do you know what I mean? Like I.
*  Like I just want to go fight like, you know, but every fight I had before that,
*  it was like, you know, I always had airplanes sitting, you know,
*  or helicopters sitting sitting around.
*  I always had, you know, it was like, I'm going to go in there and start the fight
*  and then I'm going to call in all this other this other stuff to to to win. Right.
*  And that day it wasn't there.
*  And and and literally I walked out of there and I just think about all the time today.
*  I just think about all the time of how many generations just that day were changed,
*  how many generations of of people's lives were changed.
*  You know, all my teammates died.
*  So they'll never have kids, that generation stopped their families forever.
*  So many lives were changed that day by that, that that piece.
*  And guess what? And everybody in America had no clue what was going on.
*  Like right now, there are U.S. troops,
*  somebody wondering if they're going to be able to come home and see their family again.
*  That's reality.
*  Whether you want to ignore it or not, like that's reality.
*  And that was me September 8, 2009.
*  And it was just a gosh, it was a chaotic day.
*  It's amazing how you could have
*  thousands of days in your life in one day changes the way you look at everything.
*  One day changes the way you look at everything.
*  And, you know, and like the further I go on, I look at it different.
*  You know, I always talk about this story of.
*  You know, whenever this guy came up behind me and I ended up
*  I ended up killing him with the rock and.
*  I always remember just like I remember it, like I see it every night.
*  Like, I remember, like, I just see his face and I got just because there was a point.
*  There's a point that I feel like that anybody that when they whether they're injured
*  or anything, like they realize they're defeated, like they like it like,
*  I don't know. I just think there's a point when you look at somebody
*  and they know they're going to die.
*  And I'll never forget that.
*  And, you know, now I look at it and I see it.
*  And I always think that like.
*  This guy is a son to somebody.
*  His mother and father are going to miss him.
*  This guy.
*  He believes in his cause as much as I do.
*  He doesn't believe he's wrong.
*  This guy.
*  This guy, he.
*  He could have had a wife or kids that are never going to see their father again.
*  Just like, you know, my mom, my dad, my mom, my dad, my mom, my dad.
*  My dad might have never seen me again if it was switched.
*  And really, I don't even know.
*  I don't hate him.
*  I don't even know this guy.
*  We're just here at this place right now because we were born in two different countries.
*  Were you out of weapons? Were you out of out of ammo?
*  So my no, he came up and he started choking me.
*  I had shot him once before, and he I was trying to pick my buddy, Dada Lee, my my
*  one of my closest Afghans, Dali, had been shot.
*  He he got killed.
*  He had been killed.
*  And I came around this terrace to get him and I was on my knee and this guy came up
*  behind me. And so he didn't have a weapon either.
*  No, he did. He had a weapon and I ended up shooting him from the ground.
*  And I thought he was dead when he fell on the ground.
*  And I kind of moved down and got down with Dada Lee because I was still getting shot
*  at from this machine gun up on this hill.
*  And I was trying to make myself small as I could.
*  And this guy ends up coming up and choking me like I thought he was.
*  I thought he was dead.
*  And he ends up choking me out.
*  He starts trying to choke me out and eventually let up a little bit.
*  And I ended up getting around him.
*  And I just got we were fighting back and forth.
*  And I can remember all I was thinking about was like, don't let his legs get on me.
*  Like, you know, these guys, their legs are I mean, they've been crawling up
*  mountains their whole life. And he was he was a pretty big dude.
*  And I just remember getting on top of him, finally got on top of him.
*  And I was rolling on top of him.
*  He didn't have all the gear on. I did.
*  And I remember getting on top of him like, like I was straddling him.
*  And I'm just reaching up, trying to grab for anything I can.
*  I'm holding him and holding him down with my throat with my my forearm.
*  And I'm just grabbing anything I can.
*  And finally, I end up grabbing a rock and I just started beating this dude's face.
*  And and I start beating and beating and beating.
*  And I remember I remember just like finally, like after hitting him,
*  you know, I don't know, three or four times, four or five times, whatever.
*  I remember him like finally just kind of looking at me and like
*  just it's it's like he's like, just I'm just looking him in the eyes,
*  like obviously closer than me to you right now.
*  And you just see all the you can tell, like he knows where this is going.
*  And I always think about that, you know, obviously,
*  I would kill him a million times over again, right?
*  He was the enemy, like I don't feel bad about that part of it.
*  But I just think about like in that moment.
*  If I can find a way to relate to him in that moment,
*  a man I'm taking his life.
*  We all in America can find a way to connect with each other.
*  If we don't connect with each other, it's because we choose not to.
*  I don't care what your differences are.
*  Like, don't like find a reason of why we can get along,
*  not why we should not get along. Right.
*  And and I always think about that moment, you know, of this guy and.
*  You know, he obviously ended up dying.
*  And what it showed me was is that no cause that you have
*  that's built on hate will survive.
*  I didn't hate this guy. I didn't even know him.
*  But I was willing to to take his life.
*  Because of what I loved.
*  And that's what that's what we have to build our lives and our foundation on
*  is not not being angry and hating each other,
*  but because we love the cause that we believe in so much.
*  Does that make sense?
*  It doesn't make sense.
*  I understand what you're saying.
*  The way they look at it in Afghanistan, this.
*  So it's. Is it Al Qaeda or the Taliban?
*  So Al Qaeda is mainly in.
*  So Al Qaeda was in Iraq.
*  So Al Qaeda is the issue that's in Iraq and the Taliban.
*  How is that in Afghanistan?
*  And the Taliban, what are they trying to do?
*  Are they trying to run a religious caliphate?
*  Yeah, I mean, they just want they, you know, they want to run, you know,
*  it the way that they want to, right?
*  Like they want to they don't want they don't believe in, you know,
*  women being educated.
*  I mean, they don't believe in any like like they don't believe in, you know,
*  they go back to that their beliefs of, you know, it's driven by religion
*  of all that control they want to they want to control.
*  And how much support do they have from the general population?
*  I mean, I think it not not necessarily the support,
*  but because I think that it's not necessarily support,
*  it's the power that they have, right?
*  Like they come in and they lead with a heavy hand, right?
*  I mean, there's these they don't these these these the locals run the place.
*  But the Taliban is kind of like look at it like a gang, right?
*  Like kind of like like like a mob or or or or like
*  the Taliban is kind of like the cartel, right?
*  And so that's that's where they come from.
*  And they try to lead with violence and same thing that you would, you know,
*  you would see with the cartel.
*  Taliban is kind of like an over a big cartel.
*  And so the general the population, they would like that to not be the case.
*  Yeah, I mean, they want a system of democracy similar to what we have.
*  I mean, I don't know that they want that, but I don't want something better
*  than what they have, of course.
*  Like, I mean, I think they all see that they live in shitholes, right?
*  They all see, you know, I think that they they they know what could get,
*  you know, how it could be better and how life could be better, you know? Yeah.
*  The cool thing about America is, is that we know what freedom is.
*  And I promise you this, like you want to have all the differences stop.
*  If anybody ever invaded us, I mean, people don't want to give anything up.
*  So they would all start fighting.
*  Everybody would get on the same page and start fighting
*  if anybody tried to come to America, because nobody would want to give up their stuff.
*  Well, post 9-11, do you remember that?
*  Well, that was you were a younger guy.
*  How old were you at 9-11?
*  I was in eighth grade and I always say.
*  I would never wish for another 9-11, but I would give anything for a 9-12.
*  Mm hmm.
*  I would give anything for a 9-12.
*  It was crazy. Like people were friendly.
*  People were letting people in and traffic people had.
*  Like American flags were everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.
*  People were proud of America.
*  Like it was it was crazy.
*  It was crazy, like how on in sync everybody was.
*  It's hard for people who weren't there on those days to understand
*  the mood of the country.
*  It was a different world.
*  Like we people were patriotic.
*  Everybody was.
*  I don't necessarily remember what it was like before the day 9-11.
*  So I don't I don't have much perspective on that, but I do remember 9-12.
*  I remember, I mean, everybody was proud to be American.
*  I mean, I mean, it was everybody was everybody was proud of our country
*  and who we are. Switch had turned.
*  It was. And in that the way it goes, though, like when something tragic happens,
*  isn't that the way it goes?
*  Like like we refocus on what really matters.
*  Like all these differences go away.
*  Yeah. But we come back to what matters.
*  Well, that's something that a lot of people who experience war
*  have said that this is where they felt the most connected
*  because their life was literally in danger and because they knew
*  because they had lost loved ones to this thing.
*  They had lost brothers to this thing that this was real.
*  And that to this day, that is the most exciting and happiest time of their life,
*  because they were so connected.
*  Sebastian Younger wrote about this in a movie, the book Tribe.
*  Yeah. Have you read it? I haven't read it.
*  It's very good.
*  And it probably would speak to a lot of the exact same things that you say.
*  But, you know, like I.
*  I find the same thing, not the same thing, obviously,
*  because my life's not in danger, and I hope that I never have to go a day
*  where my life's in danger again.
*  And I find the same appreciation back here in a country that.
*  That I love, I can, you know, I narrowed it down
*  because I had to come up with a reason of like why, you know, I mean,
*  it's hard to sit here and watch the valleys that you fought for,
*  and then the government go and give those valleys back to the Taliban.
*  You know, there's this one video me and my buddy were laughing about
*  the other day, a base that that he had been on, and he shows me this video.
*  And it's like literally the treadmills that were in the gym there.
*  It's a Taliban guy running on our treadmills, right?
*  Like they left it there.
*  And we're just like, whoa, you know, and and and I always think about.
*  You know, because if you get down in the weeds of it, you start really getting
*  you'll get upset about, you know, that valley.
*  Did I really did?
*  Did did my teammates sacrifice really change your your life?
*  Like if they hadn't a sacrifice that day, would would your life be changed?
*  Like because that's what we're fighting for is America.
*  And so I just I always looked at it like this and I came to peace with it.
*  You know, all we were trying to do anywhere we went when I served and I wore
*  the nation's cloth, like I got the I got the best opportunity.
*  When people thank me for my service, I'm like, don't don't thank me.
*  Like, I appreciate you letting me represent America, be the away team
*  for the United States of America.
*  Like I got to wear the nation's cloth in so many countries.
*  But I always.
*  I justify it as all we tried to do, no matter whether we were passing out
*  soccer balls to kids or we were going in and providing security for a whale or
*  we were taking out an enemy combatant.
*  All we were trying to do was make that part of the world that
*  we were in a better place.
*  That's all we were trying to do.
*  We're trying to leave it better than we found it that moment.
*  And if we take that same concept and we apply it here and we all go over and do
*  it for the person on the left and the right of us, and if we use that same
*  concept, you can apply it here in America every day, every single day.
*  You can make this world just a little bit better.
*  There's a lot of people in this country that don't think we should be
*  nation building in other countries.
*  And, um, um, including people like Tulsi Gabbard who served, but then you
*  got people like Dan Crenshaw, who I've had on the podcast, who the, what
*  his perspective is you have to go over there like that.
*  You can't allow these groups to get more powerful and gain more control.
*  You just can't.
*  You can't, you can't.
*  And if not us, then who?
*  And, and the thing is, is America's a beacon of hope across the world.
*  America is a beacon of hope.
*  And, and you can notice when America's strong, everybody hates us.
*  When America's weak, the world suffers.
*  And I'm not saying we need to go in and fight everybody's battle, obviously.
*  Right.
*  Like, but on the backside of it, you know, we're not necessarily going
*  in and fighting for other countries, but we do have an obligation to go and help.
*  People like you take Syria when they are gassing, when they are gassing kids
*  and women, if nobody else is going to go send rockets in there, if nobody else
*  is going to go hold somebody accountable for it, I'm damn, there's nobody that's
*  serving, that's wearing the uniform that's not gladly doing that and going
*  to go hold them accountable for it.
*  It has nothing to do with anything other than good and evil.
*  And if we don't go fight the evil, then who's going to do it?
*  Who's going to do it?
*  And we don't want the evil to get bigger.
*  You don't want the evil to get bigger.
*  You don't want the evil to, to, to progress.
*  And you don't want the evil to, to think that they can, I mean, imagine you see
*  what they're doing right now.
*  And I think the world knows that America will come and show up and you see how,
*  how they're still going.
*  Imagine if they didn't have to worry about us doing it.
*  Imagine what they would look like.
*  You know,
*  I think you can imagine better than most.
*  That's part of the problem is that, you know, when you're in Catlub basis, you
*  know, going to the mall, you know, getting yourself a fucking smoothie, it doesn't
*  seem real, you know, and you can have all these opinions about what we should be
*  doing, you know, and that we need to stop these warmongers and we need to stop
*  this and stop that.
*  And I've, I've had those opinions myself in the past and gone back and forth.
*  And the only thing that's changed my mind is I'd listened to people that
*  actually know.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's one of the most important things you could ever do.
*  And don't try to form an opinion if you don't really have any facts and real,
*  any real understanding.
*  I've done that in the past too.
*  I've made those mistakes.
*  I can tell you this, like, you know, you look at nine 11, thousands of people
*  died and they, none of them volunteered to give their country for their life
*  that day, except obviously the first responders you look since nine 11,
*  besides a couple of attacks that's been in America, but you look since nine 11,
*  everybody that's given their life overseas has volunteered to do that.
*  They volunteered to go fight the evil and for us to go over there and do that
*  and keep it off the country, to keep it out of our country, to keep it to where,
*  you know, our kids and our families and our mothers and fathers and, and don't
*  have to worry about this.
*  I mean, obviously, obviously it could happen anywhere, but, but I can't think
*  that us being over there and giving them a place to fight us has not helped this
*  country keep from being attacked multiple times.
*  If we had not gone over there,
*  that's a hard pill for people to swallow.
*  Right?
*  They, they don't want to think that because I think the reason why they would
*  attack us is because we're over there.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you know what?
*  I mean, what, what do you, how, why did we get attacked on nine 11?
*  That's a good question.
*  You know, like these people hate us just because they hate us.
*  Like they, they, it's not, it's not about, you know, I, I, there was that one
*  worker that said that, oh, we should go over there and get them more jobs and
*  more opportunities.
*  No, these people don't care.
*  Like these people have, they wake up every day and try to think of a way to
*  kill us.
*  Like there's no negotiating with these people.
*  These people are evil.
*  These people will do nasty things to human beings that, that nasty things
*  that no, you couldn't even imagine.
*  You couldn't make a video game about.
*  I mean, you, you look at, you look at some of this ISIS stuff of what they're
*  doing.
*  I mean, putting somebody in a cage and burning them, you want to be
*  empathetic to that throwing people because, because of their sexual preference
*  off the tie in their hands and legs together and throw them off top of a
*  building, these are the type of people that this is the type of evil, like.
*  That, that, that we're going after.
*  And if we don't do it, who's going to do it, right?
*  Who's going to do it.
*  Do you think it's possible that this all could be resolved someday?
*  That maybe if it's not our children, our children's children, do you think
*  it's possible?
*  Nope.
*  That's that everybody says that there's, that's one of the most disheartening
*  things about any kind of conflict.
*  But I mean, if you look at any of the books that came before us, this is, this
*  is what you get.
*  This is, this is just part of any, at any point in time, there's, there's
*  conflict going on.
*  It will never be resolved.
*  It will never be resolved.
*  It will never be resolved.
*  So it's main, it's like a maintenance program.
*  That's hard.
*  That's hard for people to swallow, right?
*  Cause people want to think that the reason why it'll never be resolved is
*  because the military industrial complex wants to keep us at war.
*  And this is just a big money grab.
*  And that's all they're trying to do is the reason why they have us over there
*  is they're sending people over there to die so that they can make money.
*  This is, this is how people love to look at it.
*  I mean, everybody wants to, I think it's just because everybody wants to find a
*  reason, you know, everybody wants to.
*  Everybody wants a, a reason that they can touch, feel and blame.
*  Like they want something to blame.
*  Right.
*  And they, you know, there's nothing to blame except the people who are doing
*  this and it exists and it's real.
*  And these are real people.
*  And you know what?
*  We're just so lucky that we have an all volunteer military with some of the
*  greatest people that's ever walked the face of the planet who are willing to go
*  do this, who are willing to do it on, on mining your behalf.
*  I mean, how cool is that?
*  It's pretty wild when you think about it, right?
*  Cause it's a complete volunteer army, volunteer, complete volunteer military.
*  These people are willing to raise their right hand to a piece of paper, to an
*  idea of democracy, go over, they put their whole life on hold, their wives,
*  sacrifice.
*  I mean, you take military spouses and, and they sacrifice if not more than,
*  than the people, you know, then, then, then, then the veterans and the service
*  members and they're, they're willing to go over and fight for mining your freedom.
*  They've never met us, but they're willing to give their lives for it.
*  Like, think about this.
*  Like, like I, I challenge people who are, who are listening to this.
*  Like what are, can you name one thing right now that you're willing to give
*  your life for?
*  I think about that.
*  What would you give your life for right now?
*  Like, like, like somebody pulled a gun out, you know, you're going to die.
*  What would you give your life for?
*  I mean, these people are willing to go do it on an idea of democracy, on the idea
*  of me and you on the idea of, of good.
*  It's incredible.
*  It is incredible.
*  You, when you signed up, how old were you?
*  17.
*  You were 17.
*  Wow.
*  Had my 18th birthday in bootcamp.
*  No shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  So you can do that.
*  I didn't know.
*  I didn't know you.
*  I thought you had to be 18.
*  No, no, I graduated high school at 17 and my dad signed for me.
*  Oh, someone can sign for you.
*  Wow.
*  And did you have any other aspirations or was that something that you knew you
*  were going to do?
*  No, I like honestly, a Marine recruiter chat told me I'd never make it as a Marine.
*  And so like, yeah, yeah, like I was just walking.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I get, he told me I was walking through my lunch room.
*  Like I, I don't have any cool stories.
*  Like, oh, I woke up and knew I was going to be a Marine.
*  Like, you know, I was walking through the lunch room and this Marine recruiter was
*  there, I started asking him a lot of smart, like smart out questions and just, you
*  know, being a typical high school student.
*  And he's like, look, you're wasting my time.
*  You'd never make it as a Marine.
*  And, uh, you know, look, I was up for the challenge.
*  So I signed up that.
*  So him saying that was what really stirred it.
*  Yeah, that was it.
*  Wow.
*  I didn't even really know what the Marine Corps was before that.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  What did you think you were signing up for?
*  You know, I just told him I wanted to go fight.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Holy smokes.
*  You know, but you think about that, like our whole life is built off decisions,
*  you know, our decisions, our control.
*  We are, we are today where we're, where we deserve to be because we made the
*  decisions up to this point.
*  Hmm.
*  Like, and that's a hard pill to swallow too.
*  Yeah.
*  It's variable, right?
*  There's, there's some things that are out of your control.
*  There are, but, but a lot of it, but a lot of it, you, you can't control
*  situations and circumstances, but you can control how you take it.
*  You can control your response.
*  You can control your response.
*  Growing up like that.
*  I mean, you're growing up in combat.
*  I mean, you're growing up at 18 years old.
*  I mean, I was a fucking baby when I was 18.
*  Yeah.
*  You're growing up in combat.
*  I did.
*  Yeah.
*  I guess if you look at it like that, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And you are here now 10 years after what we were talking about.
*  Yeah.
*  And you said it still keeps you up.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I wake up, you know, a couple, a couple nights a month and just,
*  you know, an anxiety attack throwing up.
*  Um, I was actually speaking last week.
*  I was on the road.
*  It's the first time, you know, I always like, I'm always nervous.
*  Like if in the middle of night, my daughter gets scared or she, you know,
*  she comes down and gets in my bed.
*  Like I'm always really like nervous about that because like, I don't, I would
*  like, I was so, I was so nervous about it because I was just, gosh, I never
*  want them to see me in that, in that, that state, right.
*  And the other day we were on the road.
*  I was speaking out in North Carolina and, um, she was obviously, we're in a hotel.
*  So she was staying with me and I don't know, I didn't feel good that night.
*  So what I did is I put a, um, I put a pillow between us and gosh, I had, I had
*  one, I knocked my tooth off, knocked my veneer off, like it was so terrible.
*  And, uh, she just looked at me, she's three and she just looked at me and she said,
*  it's okay, daddy, you're not, you're not a bad dad.
*  Wow.
*  And, uh, three and I was like, gosh, you know, but yeah, I mean, you know, you
*  still, I mean, this is, that's, that's why you look at it and I see these people
*  who play these video games and they get nothing from, like there's no emotional
*  attachment to it and it's like, this stuff's real.
*  Like there's nobody who, I would go out on a limb and say, there's
*  nobody who sees this stuff and they don't, you don't come back and deal with it.
*  Like it's, it's a normal process to, to being part of not normal situations.
*  What kind of resources are available to you when you do come back?
*  Like how, how do they treat people that are suffering from PTSD?
*  And, well, you gotta be careful with it, right?
*  Because I mean, the last track you want to get on is, is all the, the
*  pharmaceutical drugs, right?
*  Like the pills and stuff.
*  Um, and you'll get on that real quick.
*  The VA is notorious for it.
*  So, you know, we, what do they try to give you?
*  Um, I mean, I have colotipin, Xanax.
*  I've been on tons of blood pressure medicine.
*  I mean, you go down the list, right?
*  And, uh, and I, like, I went down that, I went down that road and,
*  and it got me nowhere.
*  Um, but now, you know, like we're, you know, there's tons of nonprofits out
*  there who are doing a lot of great stuff, uh, trying, trying to help out.
*  Um, you know, we're, it was one thing that we found out and then actually
*  studies are starting to show that this helps is, uh, it's called Estella,
*  Estella ganglion block.
*  It's called SGB.
*  It's a Stella ganglion block.
*  And, um, you get a shot, it goes in your neck.
*  Um, and I'll tell you this, like, when I got that shot, it instantly, before
*  the needle came out of my neck, Dr.
*  Sean Mulvaney is the guy that's, that's, that's putting all this together.
*  When the needle came out of my neck, it instantly took me from being like, like
*  my whole life was downtown New York city and rush hour traffic 15 minutes late
*  to a meeting that my life depended on to instantly being driving down a quiet
*  country road with nowhere to be instantly.
*  What is it doing?
*  So basically what it does is, is, is this is how it was described to me.
*  And you have like two systems, you have like your, your, your automatic nervous
*  system, and then you have your manual, right?
*  So your automatic is like your eyes blinking, breathing, things like that.
*  Your manual is like, Hey, I need to reach over here and grab this bottle of water.
*  And what happens is this fight or flight gets stuck in your automated, like
*  it, there's no longer, do you say, I recognize this as a threat and
*  now I go into fight or flight.
*  So what it does is you've been in that so long that it gets put over
*  into the automatic side.
*  And so what this does is it's kind of like a restart, like it, it, there's
*  no nothing that lasts long in it.
*  It, it goes in and it basically, I think it gets on, it's called the sciatic nerve.
*  And it basically gives you a rest to heart.
*  And it just, it took away all my anxiety.
*  I mean, it, it, it just, it instantly.
*  Like just melted it away.
*  How long does it last?
*  So it comes down to, I mean, sometimes I get one, one a year, one every six months,
*  but it just comes down to, do you go back and expose yourself to these chaotic
*  situations, right?
*  Like, do you go keep making bad decisions?
*  Um, but for me, I look at it as like a, it's a, it's a solution to, to, I call
*  it the flash bang of anxiety.
*  So like, it's that flash bang that gives you the moment, the separation to where
*  now I can make decisions that I don't feel like I'm out of control.
*  Now I can, I can make decisions to get, get things back together.
*  What is the actual chemical that they're using?
*  I don't know.
*  I would have to look, he's got it.
*  That's crazy that it's so effective.
*  Using stellate ganglion block to treat post-traumatic stress disorder.
*  Okay.
*  Make that a little bigger, Jamie.
*  Post-traumatic stress disorder develops in response to being exposed to extreme
*  stress, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
*  Okay.
*  The sympathetic nervous system fight or flight has been known to play a part in PTSD.
*  It's believed that extra nerves of the system sprout or grow after extreme trauma.
*  Wow.
*  Leading to elevated levels, levels of norepinephrine and adrenaline like substance,
*  which in turn over-activates the amygdala, the fear center of the brain.
*  This chain of events results in PTSD symptoms that may be, that may persist for years.
*  So part of the sympathetic nervous system called the stellate ganglion, a collective
*  nerves in the neck seems to control the activation of the amygdala.
*  A recent innovation offers potential and rapidly treating symptoms of PTSD for a
*  prolonged period of time, placing an anesthetic agent on the stellate ganglion
*  in an anesthetic procedure called the stellate ganglion block can relieve the
*  symptoms of PTSD in as little as 30 minutes.
*  And for you, it's just a few seconds.
*  Before the needle was out.
*  And last for years, the SGB reboots a sympathetic nervous system to its pre-trauma
*  state, similar to a computer reboot in the brain.
*  Norepinephrine levels are rapidly reduced and the extra nerve growth is removed.
*  Wow.
*  SGB is anesthetic procedure that has been performed since 1925 and is considered a
*  low risk pain procedure done under X-ray guidance.
*  That's insane.
*  Yeah.
*  They use a, uh, so Dr.
*  Sean Mulvaney is the guy I've been to other doctors and he's Dr.
*  Mulvaney is the only guy I would go to who does it the way he's got the whole
*  procedure set up.
*  He was a Navy SEAL.
*  Um, he's a doctor and he does it out of DC and, and, um, but nobody, you
*  know, most people hadn't heard of this.
*  You know, I've never heard of this.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, and it's, um, I went in and he called me the next day and he was like,
*  so how do you feel?
*  I said, man, I caught myself singing in the shower this morning.
*  Like I caught myself singing in the shower.
*  I don't, I can't remember, but I was like, man, I caught myself singing
*  in the shower, like I actually, like I walked out there and I, and to me, you
*  know, I got to a point at that point.
*  Like I got to a low point and I just, there was nothing, like there's nothing
*  in my life I can complain about.
*  Like there's nothing I have.
*  This country has given me a life that I could have never dreamed to ever have.
*  Um, I have no problems, zero.
*  And I just woke up every day and I was just like, I just don't want to wake
*  up feeling like this.
*  And so he's like, come do this, come do this.
*  And I came out there and did it and it, it changed, it changed my whole life.
*  That sounds infinitely better than therapy or talking through it or any,
*  any of the other methods I've ever heard of.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I mean, I think all that, I think you, I think all that matters.
*  I think the therapy, like if you want to go do talk therapy, that's, that's good.
*  Like you, you, you should do that.
*  But I always tell people who go do talk therapy, like go in there with a plan of
*  where you want your life to be.
*  Like it's like going to a nutrition coach or a workout coach and not giving them
*  goals.
*  You know, don't go in there just to go in there, like go in there with a plan,
*  you know, Hey, how, how, and have them help you get to that plan.
*  But this, this is instantly just like that.
*  That's incredible.
*  Now, did they, did they try to do that in conjunction with medication?
*  Does it, does a standalone thing, standalone thing, standalone thing, you
*  know, the only thing I do to help mine and my anxiety is like, it can get bad.
*  Like I'm talking bad.
*  When, when, when you say that, like what happens, like what's, what's the
*  process?
*  You know, I usually feel it building up, um, over days.
*  Yeah.
*  Days.
*  Like, it's almost like a, like it'll come and it just builds up and then it's
*  like, it'll, you'll have like a little, little bit of an anxiety attack or
*  whatever, you'll start feeling anxiety or anxious and that becomes your new
*  baseline and then it keeps building and people don't recognize it.
*  And for a long time, I used to like, I used to drink a lot and I didn't, because
*  I didn't, I didn't know what anxiety was.
*  I mean, what do you mean?
*  Like, this is how I feel all the time.
*  And then, you know, then what usually happens is at night, you know, just when
*  I go to sleep, it'll just, it'll rock me.
*  It'll rock me.
*  I'll start throwing up.
*  I'll be sweating.
*  I'll be crying.
*  Like, I mean, I'll be in the floor.
*  Now, are you thinking things when this is happening or is it just an
*  overwhelming sense of anxiety?
*  Just, just all encompassing.
*  I just, I don't know where it comes from.
*  I mean, obviously I know where it comes from.
*  Are you thinking about war while this is happening?
*  No.
*  No, I think it just, in my subconscious, I think, you know, obviously your brain
*  is always trying to, like when you're asleep, trying to file things and process
*  things, and I think that's what happens is like consciously, you know, you know,
*  consciously, it doesn't bother me to talk about it.
*  Like I went back and I was in another gunfight four days later.
*  And I mean, literally I was packing up all my teammates' stuff and getting
*  ready to go back to fight again.
*  And I got into another gunfight and I think that, you know, coming home, your
*  brain is still trying to process all that stuff.
*  And I think it happens to anybody.
*  You don't have to go to war.
*  You could be in a car wreck.
*  I mean, you look at, you look at the October 1st shooting in Vegas, you know,
*  you could, you can go through anything, right?
*  Like whatever it, I think that's what people are dealing with.
*  And it's just, I think that's why you see so much anxiety across the world is
*  because of all this desensitization consciously and people are processing it
*  subconsciously.
*  That makes sense.
*  That really makes sense that it's, they're taking in all this information.
*  I think it's not affecting them at all, but it really is.
*  It is.
*  And I think that's why you see all these people feeling like their lives are out
*  of control and it's because consciously, like, we're not sitting here talking
*  about it, like, well, yeah, yeah, you know, I've seen a car wreck the other
*  day or, you know, so-and-so died or, you know what I mean?
*  And it's like, they're not ever processing it consciously, but their body
*  will subcon, like your body will, I always say you can either exercise your
*  demons or they're going to exercise you.
*  That's a great way to put it.
*  What do they recommend when, when, when you, I mean, do they check on you to
*  see if you are having anxiety or do you have to come to them and explain it?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you, you just, you go to them.
*  Does anybody get through it without anxiety?
*  I mean, I, I, like, I, I would worry about the people that got through it without it.
*  I mean, you know what I mean?
*  If you can go kill people and not get through it without nightmares or anything,
*  you know, um, but I think, I think some people do, uh, I mean, I think, I think
*  people just deal with it different ways.
*  Right.
*  Um, but me, you know, like I used to drink a lot and, and, but I was doing it, not
*  because I was an alcoholic.
*  I was doing it as a, I just, I had rather, I could regulate my drinking
*  better than I could the effects of what medicine would do to me.
*  Now, do the Marines have a system that they, will they check on you and make
*  sure you're okay or guide you into a specific type of treatment when they
*  know there's something wrong?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But you know, the promise for all these war fighters is like, they don't want to
*  go talk about it or tell the Marine Corps because then they're, you know,
*  you're, you're, or the military, I'll just say military wide, you know, they,
*  they look at you as, well, now this person can operate everybody.
*  Everybody's too worried to talk about this because they're afraid of not
*  being able to do their job because they're afraid that somebody will look at
*  them and say, Oh, well, you got PTSD.
*  So you don't need a gun.
*  And it's like, you know, most people that have PTSD are car wreck victims.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  That's the biggest source of PTSD.
*  You can, you can Google it.
*  See the biggest source of PTSD is car wreck victims.
*  Wow.
*  Well, it's probably a lot of those, right?
*  A tons of them.
*  Yeah.
*  So when you do have an issue, how, how do you go from having an
*  issue to getting treatment?
*  What's the process?
*  Oh, you mean if you, if you, if you tell your command, I mean, you know, there's,
*  there's all types of resources there.
*  I mean, you know,
*  But you have to speak out.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the problem.
*  Right.
*  That's the problem is nobody wants to talk out because, you know, you start
*  talking and you know, how quick your job going to be gone.
*  You know, I got out, I was out before, you know, I was out so fast after, after
*  all this happened, I was out, you know, seven or eight months afterwards.
*  And I didn't realize what was going on until I probably never started
*  dealing with my PTSD until 2016.
*  You know, I just, I thought this was just normal.
*  What made you change?
*  My daughters, my daughter, sailor.
*  Um, I can remember the day I was in a, I was actually in the floor, like just
*  having an anxiety attack, like crazy.
*  And I was like, I gotta do something.
*  I've had, I've got to do something because my daughters, they deserve
*  the best father possible, like they, like they had no choice in coming in this
*  world and you know, I might not want to, I might not want to deal with it and
*  face it for myself, but I, they deserve for me to wake up every single day and
*  give them the best father that they could possibly have.
*  And that, that is my responsibility to them.
*  Is that when you first got this shot?
*  Cause block.
*  So I ended up getting it in 2017.
*  Yeah.
*  2017, I think.
*  Uh, and I didn't know anything about it until, you know, once I found out about it,
*  I did.
*  How did you find out about it?
*  Just another, another warrior that had gotten it and it worked for them.
*  Wow.
*  And, um, I also use, so I use, I use three methods to maintain all of it.
*  I use the stellar ganglion block, which is, it's kind of, when it gets real bad,
*  I'll go get that.
*  That's like the whole reboot, right?
*  Um, for maintenance, I usually use, it's called an alpha stem.
*  And so it goes on your earlobes.
*  I've heard of that.
*  And people quit smoking with that, right?
*  I don't know about it.
*  I don't know about that.
*  It's for usually for pain, anxiety, depression.
*  Um, but I use, I use an alpha stem and it goes, I put it on clipping on my ears
*  and it like, I usually do it every day and it just, it melts, it melts it away as
*  well.
*  And then the last piece is, is, and this is not obviously in our community, it's
*  probably not the popular side of it is, is, um, is using a, a pen at night.
*  You know, before I go back.
*  Uh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you CBD?
*  So it's the, it's the, uh, I think it's an indica.
*  Yeah.
*  And that, like that pretty much eliminated all my drinking.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Why is that not popular?
*  I don't know.
*  I think it's kind of like still like the taboo, right?
*  Like the town I come from, they just made alcohol legal in it.
*  What?
*  A few years ago.
*  Can tell Columbia, Kentucky.
*  That's crazy.
*  They just made alcohol legal.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  That's a good place to study.
*  That's like an uncontacted tribe.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you know, you look, if you, if you do, if you, if you make it legal, the
*  bootleggers are out of business.
*  Right.
*  Oh, okay.
*  It's Duke's Hazard style.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  They just made alcohol legal.
*  Holy shit.
*  So yeah, vape pens are out of the question.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Show up with a pot leaf t-shirt.
*  They'll shoot you.
*  Oh, oh, listen.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  That's yeah.
*  It's a, it's a weird taboo, but that, that combination, particularly like
*  Indica, it helps a lot of veterans.
*  Yeah.
*  The Indica is like, it's, it's, you know, you, you, you take like two or three,
*  two or three puffs of that and man, it makes you conk out your sleep.
*  You don't wake up with a hangover.
*  Right.
*  That's the cool part of it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a different kind of sleep and CBD has, uh, some great benefits for people
*  as well and alleviating anxiety.
*  A lot of people like to use the two of them in conjunction, you know, but at least
*  it's good that that's available to you.
*  Yeah.
*  Where are you living these days?
*  I live in Austin.
*  Oh, okay.
*  So you can get it there.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  It's not, if it's legal, it's not legal, right?
*  It's not.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's still there.
*  Yeah.
*  It's still there.
*  Austin's filled with hippies.
*  It's the weirdest place in off Texas, right?
*  They are.
*  Um, they're keeping it weird.
*  They definitely keep it weird, but it's a weird combination cause it's like, uh,
*  hippies, but there's also a lot of guns.
*  Yeah.
*  Like it's like, you know what I mean?
*  It's like a hunting culture and a second amendment culture.
*  And there's like a lot going on there.
*  And then hippies.
*  It's like you want to, it's like, um, it's like people wearing
*  fanny packs with guns in them.
*  Yes.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Yeah.
*  You see a guy with a fanny pack in Texas assume, assume he's carrying.
*  It's a different animal.
*  And Arizona is even weird.
*  Like Arizona is one of the open carry States, right?
*  Yeah.
*  You could just have it on your hip and go to the supermarket.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  You know, that, you know, when you, when you carry it on your hip and go to the
*  supermarket, I mean, that's obviously the first person that, that they would
*  shoot, they should shoot, right?
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Like, okay, well, I know he's armed, so let's, let's go ahead and make sure we.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  I think people think of it as a deterrent, but sometimes deterrents
*  are also attractants.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, at least you can get a vape pen there, you know, while you're in
*  town, I suggest you stock up.
*  Yeah.
*  This place is ridiculous.
*  California's got it everywhere.
*  California's got too much, you know, Jamie, what was, what did you just read
*  about the company that's, that's got a bunch of f*****g pesticides and s**t
*  and their stuff.
*  Pesticides.
*  Yeah.
*  They just tested it.
*  They just tested some s**t that we used to have in the studio, but
*  Jamie went and threw it out.
*  That's the real problem with this is wild, wild west out here.
*  And you know, you're, unless you're testing things on a regular basis, you
*  might be selling something.
*  I had a guy named John Norris who wrote a book called the hidden war.
*  And the book is all about how he was game warden and during his normal
*  duties, like looking for, you know, making sure that people aren't over
*  fishing or hunting without a license, that kind of stuff.
*  They started finding these cartel grow ops and these cartel grow ops are
*  extremely the, the weed that they're putting out is extremely dangerous
*  because it's got these super toxic pesticides to keep animals away and to
*  keep bugs away.
*  And so they're putting this s**t on weed.
*  Then that stuff winds up getting to the hands of people, particularly in other
*  parts of the country where it's illegal and it's just filled with pesticides.
*  And you know, you can get sick from that stuff and people can get real sick from it.
*  That's terrible.
*  You find it, Jamie?
*  Yeah.
*  So they had a petrosolvent extraction or something.
*  Let me see.
*  I'll just let you read it.
*  Okay.
*  So California vape maker, cushy punch caught making illegal products.
*  Dun dun dun.
*  This is in what is the website here?
*  This is Leafly.
*  So it's like a weed website.
*  We have websites.
*  So what does it say?
*  The tip what?
*  Uh, consumer affairs served a warrant.
*  Prompted by a tip.
*  Investigators at the California department of consumer affairs served a search warrant
*  Thursday, October the third in a light industrial space, Northwest Los Angeles,
*  Canoga park district.
*  That's over here.
*  They found illegal cannabis product manufacturing operation apparently operated
*  by cushy punch, a legal state licensed company.
*  Authorities seized a number of finished products, including gummies in the cushy
*  punch packaging and disposable vaporizers in cushy vape packaging.
*  In photos obtained by Leafly, the facility appeared to be performing petrosolvent
*  extractions where a technician concentrates the active ingredients in cannabis THC.
*  Petrosolvent extracting is legal with a permit in California.
*  The extraction method can sometimes have the effect of concentrating pesticides
*  along with the THC, but it says it's legal.
*  Hold on.
*  Scroll back up, Jamie.
*  Yeah, that part did say it was legal.
*  So, so it said it's legal with a permit in California.
*  So the problem was that they didn't have a permit.
*  I think maybe this place that they went to didn't have a permit.
*  Edibles and vape cartridges seized.
*  Dun dun dun.
*  San Fernando Valley facility appeared to be in the business of putting those
*  extracts into professional looking THC foods, as well as disposable vape pen
*  cartridges, tall file cabinets held thousands of boxes of cushy vape pens
*  and cushy punch edibles.
*  I don't understand this because it says if it's legal, you can source familiar
*  with cushy punch, accuse the adult use licensee of maintaining two facilities,
*  one licensed and one black market.
*  Okay.
*  Leafly is granting the sources request for anonymity.
*  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  They could have actually been using the packaging maybe too, to package some stuff
*  that was black market.
*  Well, it seems like they have one license at one place and the other place not.
*  Source alleges that the cannabis that tested clean went through cushy punches
*  license facility and into the license supply chain.
*  The source also says the cannabis might fail the state stringent pesticide
*  standards went to the illicit extraction lab pen factory.
*  Okay.
*  So some of it, but it doesn't say it did fail.
*  It says they're using, uh, so they were using untested black market oil.
*  It is heavy and pesticide.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Something got tested and they didn't know what was up.
*  Federal legalization, solve all this shit.
*  That's what they should do.
*  Federal legalization and nationwide standards.
*  You know, make it, make it so it's, it's stupid to grow shit illegally.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, yeah, make it to where it's not up.
*  He was a great South park episode.
*  I was watching about this.
*  It's fucking hilarious.
*  The new one.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  With the Mexican joker.
*  Okay.
*  See that one.
*  I did not.
*  I heard their new episodes are really good this year.
*  It's fucking hilarious.
*  They, this guy gets pissed because other people are growing weed.
*  He's got a weed operation and, uh, he's giving people weed and everybody's happy
*  and selling weed and doing great, but then people start growing their own weed and he
*  gets furious.
*  He's like, you stole my fucking idea.
*  He's like, you can't grow weed.
*  He's like, what?
*  I thought I was gardening.
*  It's like, fuck you.
*  And he's like, yes.
*  It's like, but I mean, that is the problem, man.
*  It's fucking, it's easy to grow weed.
*  It's like, you can't grow weed.
*  Yeah.
*  There's the Mexican joker.
*  The problem is that was, that was a different part of the episode.
*  The, the, the, uh, B story was that, uh, Cartman called ice on, uh, on his friends
*  because he just, it's just like, he found out that you could just call ice and, and
*  like have people suspected.
*  So he called it on Kyle and had Kyle fucking arrested and his whole family
*  arrested.
*  It's such a fuck lying there mad at Cartman and then Cartman got arrested himself.
*  It was so ridiculous.
*  What they were worried about was one of the Mexican kids growing up to become the
*  Mexican joker taking like, and killing everybody.
*  So they had like, like an ice agent.
*  I'm giving away a lot of spoilers.
*  It's worth seeing though.
*  It's fucking hilarious.
*  It's so funny.
*  It's just so ridiculous.
*  That's funny.
*  Yeah.
*  What's it's just so ridiculous when you find out like, but you can grow your own
*  weed, that's the point, but you can't.
*  You can grow your own weed.
*  That's the point, but you can't legally, federally and you should be able to.
*  It's fucking stupid.
*  It's stupid.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, especially when it helps cops and firemen and first responders and soldiers.
*  And it helps a lot of people, man.
*  Look at how much money we spent trying to fight it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the problem though.
*  There's a business trying to fight it.
*  Yeah.
*  Particularly like the prison guard unions, they always fight against it.
*  There's a lot of people who actually fight against legalization, which is, it's
*  pretty un-American thing to do.
*  We got that restaurant that just opened up in Hollywood.
*  You can smoke weed at now.
*  That restaurant can go fuck itself.
*  I'm not going anywhere near that place.
*  Listen, smoke a little weed at home, go to a regular goddamn restaurant.
*  I don't want to go to a restaurant people zoned out of their fucking mind.
*  Take a gravity bump hits at the table.
*  Can you imagine?
*  I can.
*  Everybody's freaking out.
*  I can't imagine.
*  Conversations are probably real stupid.
*  Everybody forgets what they're talking about.
*  These are rookies.
*  You can't be smoking that much weed with rookies.
*  Showing up at these buildings where you got restaurants filled with people smoking
*  weed, that's a recipe for a disaster.
*  They have to make you order before you smoke too.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  No, not after you smoke, you're like, who the fuck ordered pizza?
*  Bitch, you ordered pizza.
*  It's so high you don't remember what you ordered 10 minutes ago.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all those public places.
*  Like people are used to getting drunk in public.
*  They're used to go to a bar.
*  You can have a couple of drinks.
*  You're fine.
*  Right.
*  Two, three drinks.
*  You're fine.
*  You're just you with a little tipsy.
*  You're fine.
*  But you could have a fucking psychotic spiral.
*  If you have a pot edible at some establishment, we've all seen people lose their
*  marbles, especially if you've got some rookie from out of town.
*  Like comes over from South Dakota.
*  I can't believe you guys have free weed.
*  What is that?
*  Was that a Chiba chew?
*  And they chew that thing.
*  And an hour later, you trying to peel them off the ceiling.
*  Like, what happened to Jake?
*  Oh, the fucking guy's still high.
*  It's 48 hours later.
*  I don't know what to do.
*  Just make a room for that in the back.
*  Yeah.
*  Big padded room.
*  Like the drunk tank at jail.
*  But you had like you had the same thing.
*  Just padded.
*  Yeah, padded.
*  With soft music.
*  They just play the Carpenters and they'll just burn incense for you and just try to
*  bring you down.
*  Slow down.
*  You're going to be fine.
*  But I'm not.
*  Yeah, it's too risky.
*  Like I want restaurants where people are straight.
*  Everybody's fine.
*  You just order a steak.
*  Regular restaurant.
*  People are getting loaded in those too, though.
*  Oh, before they go.
*  Getting drunk.
*  Yeah, getting wasted.
*  But for some reason, I feel like that doesn't bother me as much.
*  Because we're used to it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  Just used to it.
*  Right.
*  Like, do you remember when you were a kid, when you first got drunk?
*  Like how old were you when you first got drunk?
*  Were you in the military or when you got out?
*  I was young.
*  Long before.
*  Yeah.
*  But you remember when you first tried, you don't, first of all, no one's there with you.
*  It's not like your dad or your uncle's going here.
*  You have two shots.
*  That's it.
*  No, you're drinking with your friends and you don't know how far to go.
*  And so I remember throwing up in the cab.
*  I was drinking Jack Daniels with my friends.
*  We were listening to music and I remember I was laying, I was like in a bean bag.
*  I was 14.
*  I was laying in this bean bag looking up and the whole fucking world spinning.
*  Yep.
*  I was like, this is ridiculous.
*  I got to get out of here.
*  I called the cab to take me home and I threw up in the cab.
*  I was like, oh my God, I didn't know how to do it.
*  I didn't know how to do it.
*  Nobody taught you how to do it.
*  No.
*  You just wind up figuring out with your friend.
*  You're just lucky if you don't drink yourself to death.
*  It's just luck.
*  It's pure luck.
*  Yeah.
*  I was 14, probably weighed 134 pounds.
*  Drinking like a fish.
*  Had no idea what I was doing.
*  Probably had five, six drinks.
*  Plastered.
*  Plastered?
*  Yeah, it's terrible.
*  But we're used to that by the time we're,
*  you go out with someone in their 28 if they don't know how to drink, get rid of them.
*  Don't hang out with them.
*  You know, I remember when I first moved to LA, I was like 27.
*  I wanted a date with this gal.
*  First date was great.
*  Second date, I met her at a bar and when I met her there, she was shit faced.
*  Just shit faced.
*  Stumbling off the fucking like, off the stool.
*  Couldn't keep her shit together.
*  Dropped a glass, broke.
*  I was like, I'm out of here.
*  See ya.
*  I left her at the bar.
*  I was like, fuck this.
*  So you ghosted her?
*  Yes.
*  Hell yeah.
*  That was the glorious days when no one had cell phones.
*  Ah, beautiful time to be alive.
*  Yeah.
*  She had a call in my house.
*  Good luck, bitch.
*  She didn't have a cell phone.
*  Very few people had cell phones in 94.
*  You know, very few people.
*  There's nobody had.
*  I mean, I had one.
*  I had a Motorola StarTac.
*  It was like big fat boy.
*  It lasted like, you could talk on it for 13 minutes before it ran out of batteries.
*  It had an antenna.
*  You pulled the antenna up.
*  Click, click.
*  You remember those things?
*  You thought you were Captain Kirk with those bad boys.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I was six.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, man.
*  In 94, we were six.
*  I was six.
*  Yeah.
*  That's when I first moved here.
*  Click, click.
*  Hello.
*  You hold it up to your ear like the detachable battery.
*  You get the fat battery.
*  You get an extra 40 minutes of talking.
*  What did you keep it at?
*  How did you carry it around?
*  I don't remember.
*  I probably had one of them holsters on the side.
*  Because it's too thick for your pocket.
*  You can't keep that fucking fat bastard in your pocket.
*  I remember when the Razor phone came out, everybody was like, holy shit, we're in the future.
*  It's a credit card.
*  You're talking on a credit card.
*  That was the shit.
*  That little thing was so small.
*  But then that was like six minutes of talking.
*  Yeah, the Razor.
*  Yeah, that thing.
*  And nobody had a cord.
*  It wasn't like today.
*  Like, hey, you got a charger.
*  Most people have iPhones or Androids.
*  It's either USB-C or it's lightning.
*  Most people have chargers somewhere, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Especially iPhones in America.
*  Back then, if you didn't have a charge, you're fucked.
*  You can go to a restaurant.
*  Nobody has a goddamn cable at a restaurant for your fucked up cell phone.
*  It didn't exist.
*  It didn't exist.
*  Most people didn't even have cell phones until like 2000.
*  When did you get a cell phone for the first time?
*  I was 17 or 18.
*  My senior year of high school was like 2000.
*  Yeah, like 2000-ish.
*  Somewhere around there.
*  Yeah.
*  I had one in 94.
*  I actually had one in 88.
*  I had one that was attached to my car.
*  It was like the box?
*  Like the little box that had the cord on it?
*  Yeah, well, sort.
*  It was actually bolted into the car.
*  It was in the center.
*  Like, it looked dope.
*  Like a pimp.
*  He drove around.
*  I lived at Honda CRX and it was like right there in the middle of the seats, like the phone.
*  But it helped me because I used to get gigs because like booking agents,
*  if someone couldn't make a gig or somebody fell out or got sick, they would call me.
*  I actually had a phone.
*  So I was in my car.
*  They'd call me up and I got a number of gigs because I had this fucking cell phone.
*  Were you in the right age where you had pager codes?
*  You know that pager was Joey Diaz forever, deep into the 2000s.
*  And if he owed people money or if he didn't like talking to them,
*  just throw his pager away.
*  Hey, I got a new pager dog.
*  You just lose that pager.
*  You can never get a hold of him.
*  Because he had to call you back.
*  So he would call you back from just random phone numbers.
*  You know, I'm going to the pager.
*  The pager was the shit.
*  But then what happened was some people got pagers that could send text messages.
*  I was going to say at first they expanded it to like you could get sports updates for
*  something like everyone needed to get sports scores all day long.
*  And like they had to pay an extra five bucks a month.
*  But I remember I was at the comedy store in the back kitchen area.
*  And one of the people that worked there had a page.
*  Maybe it was a comic.
*  I don't remember.
*  But they had a pager with a keyboard.
*  I was like, what the fuck is that?
*  And like you could send people messages.
*  I'm like, no.
*  Like, yeah, like if you're at a club, you can send them a message
*  and they can know where you are.
*  I was like, that is crazy.
*  Like that's great.
*  You're sending messages.
*  And I remember thinking I should probably get one of those.
*  But then I never got around to doing it.
*  But people were they had pagers.
*  This is before everybody had cell phones.
*  They had pagers that you could type messages on.
*  That blood Venn diagram bleed over into the next tail.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Walkie talkie to any Bravo.
*  I had one of those very close time period.
*  I would always give him shit.
*  I'm like, you have a phone.
*  Why the fuck would you put a walkie talkie on a phone?
*  A phone's better than a walkie talkie.
*  Like why not put smoke screens on?
*  Well, how about, you know, have a drum signals.
*  This is a stupid smoke signals on your phone.
*  You hear this.
*  It's a fucking fire.
*  It's a phone.
*  We everywhere.
*  Do do do do do.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't have to say over a phone's better.
*  You don't have to say over.
*  You know, I told things like you're going to have one person
*  to talk at a time.
*  And the other thing about the walkie talkie was I was like,
*  OK, can someone listen?
*  Like, do you have to press the button or could someone just listen?
*  That was the concern.
*  Like, you know, like your girl could call you and just listen.
*  You're talking shit with your friends.
*  I had a thought the other day, too.
*  This is a 90s thing.
*  Maybe you might remember this, too.
*  When you would turn on your home cell wireless phone,
*  sometimes you just hear your neighbors talking.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And like they couldn't hear you.
*  Yeah.
*  You just listen to a half an hour conversation, like,
*  yeah.
*  So I lived that we didn't have neighbors close enough.
*  OK.
*  I remember that clearly when I was living in an apartment.
*  I heard the neighbor talking to like a sock,
*  but I would hear their whole conversation.
*  That was like you picked up on their frequency.
*  Yeah, the wireless thing just got.
*  Yeah, that was what bad.
*  There was no encryption back there.
*  Yeah.
*  You didn't have to be a hacker.
*  You just had to have a fucking antenna.
*  Yeah.
*  Those days, simpler days.
*  But at least people, for the most part, were talking to each other face to face.
*  Face to face.
*  That was the vast majority of communication was face to face.
*  Now, I would venture to say it's flipped on its head.
*  And the vast majority of communication is probably through text messages.
*  Well, 100%.
*  I mean, text messages, emails.
*  People can build their own reality now, right?
*  Like I can never, you never have to look at me,
*  and I can build my own reality through Instagram, Facebook,
*  through all the social media.
*  I mean, literally, I can build my own filter.
*  Yes.
*  My life can be filtered.
*  Sure.
*  And people don't want to look in the mirror of unfiltered realness.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, they just want to be in a bubble,
*  communicate with people that have like-minded views.
*  Make their own reality.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  It is an extremely strange time when it comes to the way people communicate with each other.
*  And there's no accountability, right?
*  Like you communicate through those things.
*  Like you can say whatever you want, and there's no accountability.
*  There's no accountability for what you say to people,
*  for the shit you talk to people.
*  There's no accountability, because I can just hide behind a computer screen.
*  I can hide behind a screen.
*  I can hide behind my Instagram profile.
*  You can't find me.
*  You can't see me.
*  You know how people can like your posts?
*  Like put a little heart, they like your post.
*  Imagine if they give you an electric shock.
*  Oh.
*  If people thought you were cunts, there's like a little lightning bolt next to the heart.
*  Like this guy's a dick.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm glad they don't, because in that I'd probably get more of those.
*  We all would.
*  I'd probably be dead.
*  I'd probably be shocked to death.
*  I mean imagine if someone could just reach out and shock you anytime they want.
*  Oh, that'd be terrible.
*  It'd be fucking terrible.
*  That'd be terrible.
*  The emotional pain that people cause anytime they want, where they could just reach out
*  and say something terrible to people, especially people doing it through anonymous accounts.
*  That's the worst.
*  You know what?
*  It's like people you're saying this to, like they're real people.
*  Yes.
*  They're real people.
*  The people that you're judging, the people that you're criticizing their lives,
*  that the media chooses to put out there, like they're real people going through real problems too.
*  Do you think that you have, and this is going to be a crazy question,
*  but do you think you have more of an appreciation for life because you've taken life?
*  I think that I have more appreciation for people in life because I have seen,
*  I have seen what suffering looks like.
*  I have felt suffering.
*  Like when I look at people and people have their problems and they come to me or they say,
*  you know, hey, they tell me their experience.
*  I don't try to compare the experiences.
*  Like it's not a game.
*  It's not a, you know, it's not a, it's not a contest.
*  I try to look at them and when they tell me their experience, I just instantly go to,
*  well, gosh, like I know this person's suffering.
*  How can I help them get through it?
*  Because I know what that feels like.
*  And that's where I can, you know, I try to relate to people on that level of,
*  not to experience because look, I look at people.
*  Yeah, my day, it sucked.
*  People gone through way, way worse, million times worse.
*  You know, you look at, you know, sexual assault victims, you look at, you know,
*  you look at domestic violence victims.
*  I feel like they've gone through way worse than I could ever experience, right?
*  Like they've gone through just this stuff and their PTSD is astronomical,
*  but it's like, we can all find a way to relate on that empathetic side of,
*  gosh, you're going through something.
*  Like, let me help you get through that.
*  Like if I can help you get through that, I want to help you get through that.
*  And I think that I've, I know what it's like to suffer and I've seen suffering at such
*  extreme levels that I appreciate.
*  I just want to help people.
*  I just want to change the world.
*  What do you do with your days most of the time these days?
*  So I do a lot of public speaking.
*  I work with, I work with Hiring Our Heroes, with Helping Veterans Transition Back,
*  getting jobs in Toyota.
*  And, you know, I'm also, I'm launching a website on Own the Dash.
*  So Own the Dash is kind of like, it's kind of like my, it's my brand of,
*  of what I believe in, of owning your dash, you know?
*  Dash?
*  Dash.
*  What do you mean by dash?
*  So Linda Ellis wrote a poem, it's called The Dash.
*  And so she talks about, you know, on your tombstone, you have the day you're born
*  and the day you die, which are two of the most insignificant days of your life.
*  They're both the only two days in your life that aren't 24 hours.
*  But what matters is that dash in between.
*  And you don't have control of the day you're born or the day you die,
*  but you have control of what that dash looks like and how you made people feel
*  and how they're going to remember you the day that you're gone.
*  You have that control every day.
*  And so I'm all about owning your dash.
*  Own your dash.
*  Be the best you.
*  Don't try to be the best somebody else.
*  Be the best you.
*  Wake up every day and, and put it all on the table.
*  And put it into making people's lives better.
*  And so I'm, I'm, I have, I'm launching this site to where it's like, it's helping people,
*  empowering people to owning their dash, to being okay with being the best them.
*  I think people want to be the best them.
*  I think people want to be positive.
*  I just don't think people have anybody showing them how to do it.
*  I think there's a lot of truth to that.
*  I think there's a lot of people that are frustrated because they really don't know
*  how to live life in a positive way.
*  And they're spinning their wheels.
*  Too many people are out there.
*  People are out there.
*  They're out there surviving instead of succeeding.
*  They're just surviving.
*  And you said Toyota with Hire for Heroes, the Toyota part.
*  Hire Heroes?
*  Is that?
*  Yeah, so I teamed up with Toyota when I got out.
*  I mean Toyota has been, they, they, you know, everybody at Toyota has just been so incredible.
*  But we, I teamed up with Toyota in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
*  And so we built this platform.
*  It's a resume engine.
*  So basically it helps veterans translate what they did in the military to what corporate,
*  you know, what corporations are looking for.
*  And so Toyota just sponsors this.
*  That's awesome.
*  And so that's most of your time is these speaking engagements.
*  Yeah. And then I have a canvas company, Flipside Canvas.
*  So we, we basically do digital art.
*  So that's why you're asking about the images that we have.
*  So we have Flipside Canvas.
*  So we do digital art and we put it up on different media types.
*  So we do infused metal.
*  We do canvas and we also do floated paper.
*  Did we order those things already?
*  I was going to, that's why I was asking.
*  Oh, perfect.
*  Let's talk about that.
*  We'll do it through you.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. We're getting a bunch of shit made, right?
*  We were about to just now.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah, that'd be awesome.
*  Yeah, we'll do it through you.
*  100%.
*  I love it.
*  So we love it.
*  So I do that.
*  And then also, you know, we just, I was telling you earlier, you know, we just launched
*  Discipline Go with Jaco, right?
*  I've got the, I've got a signature flavor coming out called Dax Savage.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So this is Jaco's energy drink.
*  Yeah.
*  We were just talking about this.
*  Jaco should not have a goddamn energy drink.
*  Keep that in mind.
*  Dude, dude, so he drinks tea.
*  He drinks like herb tea.
*  If you could just bottle up Jaco's energy.
*  Runs through walls.
*  Right. If you could just bottle up Jaco's energy and pass it out.
*  Yeah.
*  He's an interesting dude, but the world's better that he's alive.
*  100%.
*  People like that, first of all, they, there are tremendous sources of him from
*  inspiration and information.
*  But inspiration, particularly important because he leads by example.
*  And what he does with his life, what he does with his days, you know, like he took an image
*  the other day on his Instagram of the sunset.
*  And it's like, this is finite.
*  You know, go get it.
*  Go get it.
*  You know, a few of these, you know, you don't get many.
*  And he does it so simple too, right?
*  Yep.
*  Like everything, like it ain't complicated.
*  Yeah.
*  It's simple.
*  It's to the point.
*  We played his video, uh, good.
*  I played it probably 50 fucking times in this podcast because I love it so much.
*  It's a video where he's talking about his response to anything that goes wrong.
*  Good.
*  There's a, here's a chance to grow.
*  Good.
*  Good.
*  Learned, you know, and there's like this, this video and it's so intense because it's so,
*  there's, there's great music and animation to it.
*  And the video is on YouTube.
*  I've literally watched it a hundred times.
*  Yeah.
*  And when I got, you know, when I get my hardest times out, I guess what I watch,
*  I watch that good video.
*  Like it's done so much for me.
*  That video is amazing.
*  It's amazing.
*  Like it just, it just puts it in perspective.
*  It's like, I don't know.
*  What is it?
*  Two minutes long.
*  Yeah.
*  And it like that two minutes, like you just, if you're driving down the road,
*  like you just want to, like afterwards, you just want to kick your windshield out.
*  Like, let's do it.
*  Right.
*  It's like, let's do this.
*  It's fuel.
*  It's inspiration.
*  I mean, it makes your fucking hackles raise up.
*  It makes you, gives you goosebumps.
*  Yeah.
*  It makes you want to go.
*  It makes you want to go.
*  Yeah.
*  It makes you just want to, it's, it's, it's just makes you want to go.
*  That's why guys like Jaco and Tim Kennedy and David Goggins and these,
*  these fucking dudes that are out there that provide so much inspiration.
*  Yeah.
*  I heard Goggins, he said that he did the one the other day.
*  He's out there running and he said, I don't know how I'll slaughter it, but he goes,
*  you know, he goes, it's hot out here.
*  And he goes, this guy pulled up to me and he said, I don't know.
*  He said something to me about, you know, why are you running?
*  It's so hot.
*  And he's like, you know, we need doctors.
*  We need lawyers and we also need hard motherfuckers.
*  We need fucking savages.
*  We did.
*  He sends me random text messages out of nowhere.
*  Cause they're so ridiculous.
*  He's so fucking savage, man.
*  But he, he means it.
*  Like he sends you these, these text messages and I get them just randomly.
*  Like here's one.
*  No need to respond.
*  Hope all's well, brother.
*  Continue to live in the grip of life.
*  As you know, nothing gets done by being a bitch.
*  Stay hard, brother.
*  It's a random David Goggins text message.
*  I'm like, it's Tuesday.
*  I'm at home just watching TV or something.
*  I get this message like, what the fuck?
*  Jesus Christ.
*  And you know, he's out there.
*  It's probably 115 degrees outside.
*  He's been running for 18 hours.
*  Stay hard.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Those guys are a massive source of inspiration.
*  They are.
*  They are.
*  Then you know what?
*  And like, I just love them all so much because they're real.
*  Yes.
*  Like they're just, they're real.
*  Like it's not an act.
*  It's not a performance.
*  Right.
*  It's not a, it's not a show.
*  It's not, you know, they're just, they wake up every day, like, especially, you know,
*  Jocko like wakes up every day, Tim Kennedy.
*  I mean, these guys just wake up every day and live everything that they say.
*  And Jocko wakes up every day and takes a picture of his fucking watch.
*  He does.
*  Like it's 430 bitch.
*  Here we go.
*  That's not, that's not the way that, you know, somebody like me would do it is like I would
*  take like 10 of them, 10 of them in one day and then I would put them on HootSuite and
*  they would come out, they would come out on the top.
*  One day you wake up at 430.
*  Yeah.
*  That's just not, that's just not, you know, but they, they crush it and that's why, you
*  know, the world needs, the world needs them.
*  They, the world does.
*  And also people with the kind of experiences that they've had,
*  they're, they're, their inspiration means more.
*  You know, there's a lot of people out there giving inspiration, but they haven't done shit.
*  When you get inspiration from someone that you know is living it every goddamn day,
*  yeah, you know, pushing it every goddamn day, pushing every day and like finding like,
*  you know, they got every reason to not do it, but they always find the reason to do it.
*  Yeah.
*  Jaco's recently gotten into bow hunting now, which is pretty exciting.
*  How was that, how was that bow hunting with him?
*  It was great.
*  Well, I wasn't hunting with him.
*  I was in camp with him.
*  He was hunting with my friend, John Dudley, who's, who coached me and has helped me and
*  he's coaching, he coached Jaco to his first elk and you know, so, but we all got to share
*  camp and talk.
*  We did a podcast together.
*  It's available on Knock On Archery and it's also available on my brother Andy Stump's
*  podcast, which is Cleared Hot.
*  I love Andy.
*  I love Andy too.
*  He's a shit.
*  He was in camp as well and we were there for five days in Utah.
*  We had a great fucking time.
*  It was awesome.
*  That's awesome.
*  It's gorgeous up there, man.
*  God, it's so beautiful.
*  Andy's an awesome dude too.
*  He's crazy.
*  He's legitimately crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Anybody who has the world record for the longest flight suit in one of them flying squirrel
*  fucking suits, that guy's out of his fucking mind, but he doesn't do the flying squirrel
*  suit anymore.
*  He doesn't?
*  Nope.
*  No, he had a buddy die.
*  Well, he's had several, but one too many, I believe.
*  And then base jumping.
*  He's had a bunch of friends die.
*  Did he quit base jumping?
*  Yes.
*  He's still skydiving.
*  Yeah.
*  No more base jumping.
*  We're supposed to skydive together.
*  I skydive a lot too.
*  So I love it.
*  I don't skydive.
*  I mean, I'm nowhere near Andy Stump.
*  Dude, that looks like a ridiculous thing to do.
*  I don't get it, but I was just in a hot air balloon recently.
*  That was as close as I get to skydiving.
*  Yeah.
*  You wouldn't do it?
*  Come on.
*  I definitely would do it, but I don't want to.
*  I don't want to jump out of a goddamn plane.
*  I would do it.
*  If I had to do it, I would do it.
*  But I don't want to do it.
*  You wouldn't volunteer to do it?
*  No.
*  It's just some crazy thrill.
*  Look, we're almost going to die.
*  And then we landed.
*  Woo.
*  Don't you feel better that you didn't die?
*  I can imagine that.
*  I'll lie in bed and close my eyes and pretend I'm jumping out of a plane.
*  I'm good.
*  You're good?
*  Yeah.
*  But Andy, that's not enough.
*  He's got to get in that goddamn squirrel suit.
*  And then fly close to all those...
*  Yeah, and you can calculate that shit wrong if you don't know every goddamn nuance of
*  the surface of the earth.
*  Or just like the wind.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Well, how about that?
*  I mean, there was one that we played on this podcast that's horrendous where a guy was
*  trying to bridge the gap through the Golden Gate Bridge and he slams into the bridge
*  while these people are watching.
*  Oh.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  And the sound when it hits the bridge is like a car accident.
*  That sounds terrible.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's so terrible because you realize that people are realizing this guy's going to hit
*  the bridge because he just...
*  You know, you're floating.
*  It's not like you have like controls.
*  You're just kind of guessing and it's like you guess wrong.
*  Slam right into the side of the bridge.
*  It's horrific.
*  Yeah, if it's all about guessing, then I'm not usually good at guessing.
*  No.
*  Not interested, man.
*  The one of the greatest jujitsu guys of all time,
*  Hols Gracie, he died skydiving.
*  Not skydiving.
*  Really?
*  What's that called?
*  What's it called when you're on the...
*  Paragliding.
*  Paragliding, yeah.
*  You know, the triangle thing and flying around those things.
*  That's how he died?
*  Yeah, he died slamming into a mountain.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  That would suck.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But again, he's goddamn savages.
*  He can't get enough adrenaline.
*  I like Andy.
*  I love it.
*  I love Andy.
*  Andy's like...
*  I blame him for me getting into it.
*  You know, he got...
*  I was interested in it and I did it.
*  I love it though.
*  I love it.
*  He's gotten a couple of friends of mine into it.
*  Goddamn psycho.
*  Yeah.
*  I keep...
*  He told me though that I can't...
*  He said no base jumping.
*  He did tell me that.
*  He's like, no base jumping.
*  He's like, don't be base jumping.
*  Yeah, that one doesn't work out all the time.
*  It doesn't, does it?
*  No.
*  No, there's times it doesn't work out.
*  And when it doesn't work out, it's terrible.
*  Yeah.
*  It's...
*  I just...
*  I get it.
*  But those things...
*  Those cheap thrills, you know?
*  It seems like a cheap thrill.
*  I get it.
*  I get it.
*  I mean, I'm not telling anybody they shouldn't do it.
*  It definitely should be legal.
*  I'm not saying it should be illegal.
*  You should be able to do it for sure.
*  You should do it.
*  Fuck that.
*  So you're not even on the fence.
*  Fuck that.
*  Not interested.
*  Come on.
*  What else are you doing with your time these days?
*  That's it.
*  Raising my daughters.
*  You know, I got two and three year old.
*  They're awesome.
*  That's always fun.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Flying my helicopter.
*  You got a helicopter?
*  Yeah.
*  Holy shit.
*  My buddy...
*  Tim's introduced me to a guy named Shane Steiner.
*  And he got me into flying.
*  So I love it.
*  I'm addicted to it.
*  I love it.
*  It makes my life a lot easier.
*  Also, if I go to Dallas or Houston, it's a difference in me getting home that day
*  versus me staying another night and not being able to wake up in the same house as my kids.
*  I love it.
*  I love it.
*  That's pretty cool, man.
*  I've been up in them before.
*  I was in them in Hawaii.
*  I've flown them in them when you do the tour of the volcanoes.
*  And then recently, my friend Bill Burr, he's gotten really into flying helicopters.
*  And he took me up when we flew around downtown LA.
*  It was crazy.
*  We went around Malibu after the fires, too.
*  Oh, wow.
*  We see it from the surface, from the sky rather.
*  You get a totally different perspective of how bad the damage was.
*  But yeah, he loves it.
*  He flies all over the place.
*  I love it.
*  I love it.
*  It seems like a lot of fun.
*  Yeah, you come to Austin, we'll go fly around.
*  Fuck that.
*  No, I'll fly with you for sure.
*  How long have you been doing it for?
*  A couple weeks.
*  A few weeks.
*  No, I should be taking my...
*  I should be taking my...
*  So if I do anything...
*  Is this you?
*  Yeah, that's me right here.
*  Oh.
*  So did you buy this thing?
*  You bought a plane?
*  Holy shit.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, a helicopter?
*  That's ultimate freedom, though, right?
*  Oh my gosh.
*  You can go wherever the hell you want and you can land in a small area.
*  Yeah, sometimes you're flying over the Lake Travis and just like eight to 10 feet off the water.
*  Oh, wow.
*  It's like, yeah, there's Shane right there.
*  Today's his birthday, actually.
*  Happy birthday, Shane.
*  Happy birthday, Shane.
*  That's pretty dope.
*  That was the day I did my first solo.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Yeah, the first...
*  How far did you fly?
*  So basically, you just go up and you do three takeoffs and landings.
*  So that's his helicopter over there.
*  Oh, okay.
*  The red one in the background?
*  Yeah, we're starting our...
*  We're starting a helicopter club, you know?
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  Hell, he's angels.
*  Have you ever been hella hunting?
*  I have.
*  I have pigs.
*  Have you?
*  Yeah.
*  I've watched Ted Nugent.
*  There's a show that they did called Apocalypse Now.
*  The Porkalips.
*  Where he's hanging...
*  Ted Nugent hanging out of a helicopter gunning down these wild pigs.
*  People who don't know, it's really actually a necessary evil because these wild pigs,
*  in Texas in particular, they've overrun the state.
*  There it is.
*  Yeah.
*  There's Uncle Ted Apocalypse.
*  Oh, God.
*  This is so ridiculous.
*  And he's just taking them out.
*  Tink, tink, tink.
*  There's so many of them.
*  Yeah.
*  It has to be done.
*  It does have to be done.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  The video is goddamn crazy.
*  You got to see him doing reload.
*  And they're just gunning these pigs down from the sky.
*  And that's...
*  They're doing a talk.
*  Brian Kwakos, Pigman.
*  He's got a show called Pigman.
*  Yeah, that's in the same type of helicopter.
*  I think it's R44.
*  Yeah.
*  This is a fucking crazy video, man.
*  It's so crazy.
*  That is so awesome.
*  They shot, I think, something like 250 hogs in a day.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Just flying around, gunning them down.
*  That's a lot of bacon, a lot of barbecue.
*  That is.
*  Yeah, they just round them up.
*  And they actually feed the homeless with them.
*  The thing about pigs is they're destructive and they're terrible,
*  and they're terrible for the ranches,
*  and they're terrible for these farms.
*  But they're damn delicious.
*  They are.
*  So if you...
*  Especially those...
*  The wild ones actually taste better than domestic pigs.
*  It's far superior meat.
*  But it's...
*  You gotta...
*  A lot of times, though, you get to them and they're all nasty.
*  They all eat up with stuff.
*  That can happen, too.
*  Yeah.
*  You gotta watch them be infected.
*  And like, you know, because they eat everything.
*  But they'll come in like a pig will tear up.
*  And it's crazy how fast they reproduce, right?
*  Like, I think it's like a pig's gestation.
*  So I think after a pig is born, I don't know how long it is when they...
*  After they have their first litter,
*  like it's like every, I don't know, six months or if it's six weeks,
*  I don't know what the...
*  I think they can have their first litter at six months.
*  Yeah, six months.
*  And then I think it only takes them like...
*  I don't know how it is,
*  but like usually after they have their litter, they're pregnant the next day.
*  That's crazy.
*  Like, it's like there's this whole gestation period of why they reproduce so much.
*  Right.
*  And that's the problem with them.
*  They're everywhere in Texas.
*  They're everywhere in California now, too.
*  They're in San Jose and people's front yards chewing up their grass and stuff.
*  They're all over the place, man.
*  What do they do?
*  What do they do about them out here in their front yards?
*  Well, you can hunt them.
*  The place where I'm hunting elk, you can hunt pigs.
*  That's Tahoe and Ranch.
*  And there's, you know, in Northern California, I mean,
*  it's a famous place where Hunter Thompson used to hunt them with AK-47s.
*  He used to go out and hunt pigs.
*  That's awesome.
*  A famous picture of him with a pig hanging from a rope that he's quartering, you know, gutting.
*  That's so awesome.
*  Yeah, they were brought to California by William Randolph Hearst, believe it or not.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. He had Hearst Palace up there, or Hearst Castle, and he wanted to bring a bunch of wild
*  animals up there. So he had all these wild animals running around on his lawn and some of them were
*  Russian boars. So he brought over these Russian boars and sows and they bred.
*  And now they're all over the place.
*  And here they are.
*  Particularly Northern California.
*  They get about as far south as Bakersfield, the Bakersfield area.
*  Eventually they're probably going to make their way to the San Fernando Valley.
*  They'll probably link up. They'll probably just keep going and link up in Texas.
*  Probably.
*  You know?
*  Well, they're fucking everywhere, man. People don't know. If you've never seen it before,
*  people on the outside are like, oh, why would you want to shoot pigs?
*  But if you just saw the kind of devastation and millions and millions of dollars worth
*  of property damage every year from these farmers. And for farmers, like, they're on a tight margin
*  as it is. You know, if you're a farmer or rancher, you're trying to grow crops,
*  it's tough to make a living.
*  And you got to worry about weather and everything else, much less pigs.
*  Millions of pigs, too.
*  Millions.
*  Yeah. I mean, people are like, wait a minute, millions? Exaggerating? No. Millions. I think
*  they estimate. What is, find out this, what's the number of wild hogs estimated in Texas?
*  Just in Texas alone, I would bet, let's take a guess. I'm going to say four million.
*  Yeah. I'd go higher. I'd go five.
*  Five. What does it say, Jamie?
*  1.5.
*  No, they don't know shit, liberals.
*  Yeah.
*  God damn hippies. Is that real? That's what it says?
*  Texas government website.
*  Texas government. They're corrupt.
*  Yeah. It's the government. You can't believe it.
*  Can't believe the government.
*  Well, we were a little off on that one.
*  Also, Ted Nugent's out there. He's probably, probably be 15 million if it wasn't for him.
*  Yeah. Ted Nugent. He's awesome.
*  He's fucking, he's an interesting cat. I enjoyed talking to him. I had him on the podcast and
*  a lot of people, he's a polarizing character, you know? But then I don't think people understand
*  him. He talked to him. He's actually a very good man. Like he's a good guy. He's got this
*  outrageous side to him and he says a bunch of outrageous shit, but that's also part of the way
*  he gets attention for some of the things that he believes in, you know? I don't think he's a bad
*  guy at all.
*  Yeah. I mean, you got to make a statement to get people to pay attention, right?
*  Yeah. And also you got to realize like this guy has been fighting the same fight for a long time
*  in regards to hunting rights for a long, long time. Back when people didn't really have the
*  same information that they have today. Like now today people can understand like, oh,
*  conservation is actually very important and it's important to remove certain numbers of the
*  population of these animals. And also the money that you spend on these tags and on hunting
*  licenses and even on gear, a percentage of that goes towards protecting habitat and hiring game
*  wardens. And it's a very efficient system and it's a system that's actually managed by wildlife
*  biologists.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's a system that's very managed, you know, like just like in Alaska,
*  like they're game wardens up there. I mean, it seems like if you killed a moose or you fished
*  with the wrong thing, you know, the wrong hook, it's more important than if somebody got killed
*  or something.
*  You know what somebody told me though, which is interesting, you know, they have that game
*  wardens TV show. You know, there's like a show about game wardens. And somebody was telling me
*  that game wardens are like some unscrupulous game wardens are actually setting guys up just so they
*  could be on these shows.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah. They're trying to set up stings and set up these things just so they could be on the
*  shows. They might even be entrapping people.
*  They, I know like where I was from, like they would put this deer out. It's like that, you know,
*  if you get in trouble, shoot, you know, if you can't shoot from the road and they put that
*  robot, they put the robot with a camera on it. I could film people trying to kill it.
*  Yeah.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Get you. Yeah. I just had to watch out.
*  Watch out for robo deer.
*  Yeah.
*  Make sure it's a real deer.
*  Yeah.
*  It actually moves its head and shit. It does. I've seen that thing.
*  It'll move and stuff. And they put it out in the field, like where like people drive by and they
*  see it in the field. And, um.
*  Well, you know, on one hand, I'm like, that's hilarious. And the other hand, fuck poachers.
*  Yeah.
*  So good.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, good for out there doing that.
*  If you're out there doing that, it's not fair, right?
*  Yeah. Well, it's crazy too. And you know, there's so many people out there that don't
*  follow the rules that are out there shooting animals are not supposed to shoot. And,
*  you know, there's a reason why we have so many animals. It's because they,
*  they have the stringent set of rules that they want you to follow.
*  Yeah.
*  And if you can get a tag for two animals, great. That's what you're allowed to get. You get two
*  animals. That's it. And if you get four or five and you're storing them in your freezer and not
*  letting anybody know you're a criminal and you're part of the problem. And if everybody did that,
*  there would be no animals left. And that's really what this country had at the turn of the century
*  when market hunting was in full swing. They mean almost wiped out black bears, almost wiped out
*  white tail deer, almost wiped out elk. To this day, elk in this country are only in a small
*  percentage of the population that they use, including grizzly bears, small percentage of
*  the place where they used to be. California has a goddamn grizzly bear as its state flag.
*  There's a grizzly bear on the flag. There's no fucking grizzlies here. They whacked them all.
*  They killed every one of them. But they did that because they were killing people.
*  The last guy that get killed by a grizzly bear was in, I think his name is Steven Leveque.
*  There's a town named after him. When you're headed up north, if you're on the way to Bakersfield,
*  there's a town called Leveque and that's where that guy got whacked.
*  So they named a town after him?
*  Yeah. That's the last place where a person get killed by a grizzly bear in California.
*  They just gunned them all down like, eee, enough.
*  Got rid of all of them. That's awesome.
*  Have you ever been around a grizzly bear in real life?
*  Not a grizzly bear. I've seen brown bears, black bears.
*  Well, brown bear is a grizzly. It's the same thing. Unless it's a color fairy's black bear.
*  There's a little difference between them.
*  The difference is really their diet. Grizzly bears are more aggressive because
*  they're out there fucking up moose and deer and shit. It's a hard knock life for a grizzly bear.
*  The brown bears, they're out there crushing moose too, right?
*  They are. But they're also eating a shitload of fish. Brown bears are coastal bears.
*  Like Alaska.
*  That's where I was at, Alaska. That's where I was around them, in Alaska.
*  There's a crazy picture that went viral a couple days ago. This couple guys are fly fishing and
*  they don't even realize that a bear is right behind them. They're standing there in the river
*  and this fucking huge bear. See if you can find the picture. These guys are on the river. A viral
*  image. Men don't know bears behind them. They're fishing around this river. This fucking huge bear
*  is just right behind them looking at them. They don't even know it's there.
*  That's awesome. I'm glad bears are something else.
*  There's something else.
*  I thought you were, there's another video I was looking for.
*  Look at that. They don't even know. They're fishing. Like, hey guys.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  They had no idea. There's a fucking 900 pound bear right behind them.
*  Yeah, I mean, and then you're kind of screwed right there.
*  Well, like, like, like, do you think the guy's yelling at him as he's taking the photo or do
*  you think he took the photo and then told him? The guy probably stayed there for hours taking
*  pictures. Never told him. He probably was hoping that the bear ate him and he'd get the best picture.
*  There's one, there's one crazy video of these people riding these bikes down this trail.
*  And, um, oh, the men in the photo were barely bothered when they realized the bear. Oh,
*  well, they must be Alaskan natives. Yeah. Goddamn savages up there. Crazy.
*  People don't give a fuck. Those are different. That's a different breed of human up there.
*  Yeah, that's like, they're, they're hard people in Alaska.
*  Hard people. Hard people.
*  Yeah. Looked over his shoulder and continued fishing.
*  The bears in the park regularly walk up and down the river bank,
*  searching for food and will dive into the water dozens of times per day.
*  See, the thing is those bears have so much salmon, they get so much meat that they,
*  they just think of salmon as food. Like people are just a pain in the ass that might,
*  might shoot them and kill them. They're not interested in that as much.
*  Yeah. They probably would have jumped right over me or walked right past me to get the salmon.
*  Yeah. There's, I mean, that's why they're so big. They get so much protein. There's an insane amount
*  of fish that come up that river and that's, that's where the salmon are there. There's a great video
*  of this guy. He's got a camera set up and a bear walks right next to him and just sits down.
*  And it's like, as close as where Jamie is and it's fucking huge. It's so big. This guy's got
*  a lawn chair there. He's like, Hey bear, come on, man, get out of here. Bear is like 900 pounds or
*  something. It sits down right next to where, like right where Jamie is just chilling, looking at,
*  and he look out onto the river itself and it's filled with bears, like 40 bears in view,
*  because they're all just going through the salmon run. That's insane. It is insane. That is insane.
*  Yeah. I lived up in Alaska for a year and it was a whole different world. It's a different world.
*  There's a whole different world. It's barely America. Yeah. It's like, it's a really nice
*  place to visit. I love Anchorage. I've only been once, but man, I really enjoy the shit out of it.
*  When did you go up there? I guess it was two, three years ago. My friend Ari Shafir and I,
*  we did some salmon fishing. Then we did a couple shows up there. Yeah. Yeah. We had a great time,
*  man. Yeah. Like during, I think like April to, you know, probably September is really,
*  it's awesome. It's hard to sleep though. Yeah. I mean, cause it's, you gotta cover your eyes.
*  Like it's weird. Yeah. Like you're tired and it's looks like it's two o'clock in the afternoon. Like
*  this is fucking strange. That's pretty cool though. Yeah. And it doesn't get too warm up there.
*  Obviously, but those mosquitoes are gangster. They're like, they should be like the state bird.
*  Those mosquitoes are so big. They're terrible. They're so big and so aggressive. They don't even
*  make sense. Yeah. Yeah. We, uh, we got out of the car. We got to the river and you know, you pull
*  up the trailhead and we, uh, we got out of the car and we hadn't sprayed the bug spray on. We opened
*  up the door. I was thinking, well, we'll get out, you know, I'll put my clothes on. Then I'll spray
*  myself a bug spray. The moment we opened the door, the car was filled with a hundred mosquitoes.
*  Like how the fuck did they even know we're here? They just found us. Fresh blood, fresh blood.
*  Just open the door and it's like, what the fuck man? We're both swatting and we're inside the,
*  we're spraying bug spray inside the truck. It's ridiculous. That's so awesome. Yeah. It's a,
*  it's a crazy place to live, but it's also like when you're up there, you, you recognize like,
*  oh, like this is a, these people have a way closer relationship with the natural world than we do.
*  It gets cold as fuck in the winter. They're surrounded by grizzly bears, moose are everywhere,
*  deer everywhere. It's just a different, different relationship with wildlife. Yeah. It's, it's like,
*  you know, and everything up there, like the one thing I noticed is if whether you're going out to,
*  there was a cabin, um, there was a cabin at mountain Denali. And so what we would do is we'd
*  ride snow machines. You'd have to park and then you'd have to ride snow machines out to it. And
*  it's like everything you do up there is it's, it's like serious. You know what I mean? It's not,
*  you better take it serious or you could die. Yeah. Everything, everything, everything.
*  Everything. You know, if you want to go fishing or, you know, on the, on the river or whatever,
*  like it's all, it's all serious, but it seems like the people have a different attitude. What
*  is this? The mosquitoes there? Oh my God, that's an Alaska. Yeah. They, they can kill baby caribou,
*  caribou calves. Literally mosquitoes will like sting them around their eyeballs, their assholes
*  until they die. Swarm engulfed scientists recorded God awful phenomenon. That's crazy.
*  Man, that's, that's nature, right? That's what happens when you only get to live for a couple
*  of months. Yeah. You just got to go all out. Yeah. That's why in LA there's fucking zero mosquitoes.
*  They're like, they're just like chill. Oh my God, look at this legs are just covered.
*  They'll bite you right through your fucking pants. They don't give a shit about your pants.
*  Look at that guy's foot. Oh my God. Look at, click on the foot covered in mosquitoes.
*  That is crazy. Oh, that is crazy. Oh my God. That gives me the heebie-jeebies. Just looking at it.
*  Why is that guy letting that happen? Backpack monster skeeters. Yeah. They're doing it for the
*  gram. Get your feet lit up just for Instagram. It's not worth it. Keep your feet protected, bro.
*  It's too crazy. They'll, they'll go right through your socks and they're terrible. They don't give
*  a shit about clothes. They're not going to protect you clothes. Nope. Not up there.
*  Do you get a chance to do much hunting these days? You know, I haven't, I haven't hunted much.
*  I haven't. It's not since I've been home. I used to, I grew up hunting. I grew up hunting and
*  you know, we've got a farm in Kentucky. And so I grew up there hunting with my, you know,
*  my whole life and I haven't hunted the tons since I've been home. I've hunted, I killed a,
*  a Neil guy down on the King Ranch. Oh wow. That's a big animal. Yeah. That's an elk size animal.
*  It's like a horse with horns. Yeah. Right. Yeah. It's a beautiful, apparently,
*  unbelievably delicious. That's what I hear. Yeah. Beautiful. It's a beautiful animal. I killed a
*  bear up in Alaska. I've killed, I've killed some deer since I've been home, you know, on the farm,
*  but you killed a black bear. I killed a black bear. Yeah. They're delicious too. Oddly enough,
*  right? Yeah. People don't know. Yeah. They're, they, they taste good. Yeah. Yeah. That King
*  Ranch is crazy. How many acres is that thing? It's, I think it's almost a million, right? It's almost,
*  I think, I think that's what it is, right? I think it's almost a million. Texas is so strange. I
*  think it's like, I think it's almost a million acres. I think it's like the largest land.
*  1.225. Yeah. Yeah. And the crazy thing is, is like, you're talking, you're talking about,
*  I got so fired up because, you know, I mean, I come from a farm and, and, and, you know, the deer
*  there, it's not like they're, they're, you know, they're not, we don't feed them. You know, we
*  don't, we don't, we don't grow deer there. Right. Right. And so you're driving out and literally
*  you're getting out to open the gate, leaving the King Ranch and you look over to your right,
*  you know, 10 feet off the road and there's a, you know, a non-typical huge deer right there. And
*  you're like, I'd give anything to have that on my wall. Yeah. But it's a weird thing, right? Because
*  they do feed them. So it's almost like agriculture. Yeah. They, I mean, you know, they put out food
*  plots and stuff like that. And, you know, the food plots make sense. That's just plants that the
*  animals eat, but feeders. Oh, feeders. Yeah. That's where I draw the line. I'm like, okay,
*  what are we doing here? Is this agriculture or is this hunting? Is it killing or hunting?
*  Even if it's a million acres, if it's a million acres in every, you know,
*  800, 900 yards, you have a feeder and all the animals gather on the feeders. You got a blind
*  you hang out by the feeder. Yeah. That's the King Ranch. That's a Neil guy. Yeah. How good
*  with those things. They're good. I hear they're better than elk. It was really good. I hear it's
*  insanely delicious. Oh, it is so good. I've never had elk, but. Oh, I can take care of that. How
*  long are you in town for? I leave out tonight. Oh, I'll give you some in a freezer bag. You can
*  bring it home with you. They were, you know, so the thing about them is when you see them,
*  they're running. Uh huh. Like as soon as. Well, they used to be in around lions. That's what's
*  so crazy about Texas. Like they, they take all these African animals. Like you can, you can
*  hunt a fucking zebra in Texas. Yeah. Zebra. What? Yeah. Zebra. What? Why is there a zebra here?
*  And the zebras get out too. That's what's really fucked up. They keep them in these high fence
*  ranches, but those fences break. And then you got zebras just running around. Running around. Yeah.
*  I got a buddy who has a farm who has elk, you know, down in Texas. He's got elk. Yeah. On this farm
*  because they got out. You know, they just came down the river. Well, that's a real common thing in
*  West Texas now is elk. There's quite a few of them. And you know, you look at some of the ranges where
*  they, um, where, where they hunt them and you, it looks like you're, you might as well be in Colorado
*  or something like that. That's weird. Yeah. And I got a buddy who, um, he has giraffes on his farm.
*  Two giraffes. What is he doing with them? They're just there for just to go, you can go feed the
*  giraffes. I had a bit of my act a couple of years ago and my, uh, triggered Netflix special triggered
*  about Texas and about how there's more tigers in captivity in Texas than in all of the wild of the
*  world. Really? Yep. More tigers in dudes backyards in private collections. It's crazy. There's more
*  tigers in Texas than all of the wild of the world. So these giraffes, I think, uh, I think the story
*  behind them was is, and I'm, don't quote me on it, but I think the story behind them was, is like
*  this, the zoos couldn't afford to feed them anymore. And so they brought them in and let them run.
*  And so they feed them like it wasn't, you know, that makes sense. Yes. Like the zoos, I guess,
*  they couldn't afford to keep up with them or something. That makes sense. Yeah. This is
*  something, it's something oddly perverse about bringing animals that are not supposed to be
*  at a certain place to a certain place. You got something, Jamie? What do you got? In Texas,
*  it's easier to own a tiger than a dog. That a dog has been labeled dangerous. It's estimated there
*  could be from 2000 to 5,000 tigers living in the Southern state of the United States, meaning Texas
*  could have more tigers than roughly the 3,800 tigers living in the wild globally. The, um,
*  the, yeah, if you have a dog that's dangerous, people think you're an asshole. If you got a
*  tiger like, Oh, you're just in the wildlife. That's crazy. That's crazy. That's such a
*  fucked up thing to have in your yard. You got a fucking tiger. How, how much do you trust your
*  fences? I mean, what kind of fence control they have? They have fence regulations. That surely
*  they have to, right? I don't know, man. It's pretty nuts, but there's a lot of them, a lot of them
*  there. And again, there's in so many people's backyard, no one really knows how many tigers
*  there are. Some people put the United States tiger population around 7,000. Others say it's inflated
*  by animal welfare activists to raise money. Oh, of course. That's what it is. Of course. That's what
*  it is. That's what they would think. Making money. There's a lot of them there though, man. I know a
*  bunch of people that have seen tigers in people's yards in Texas. And in fact, there was a crazy
*  story about these kids were smoking weed and they went into this abandoned house and they go into
*  the abandoned house and inside the abandoned house is a tiger in a cage. And they're like, wait, what?
*  What? So they walk into this fucking abandoned house to try and get high and they find a tiger.
*  That's almost like a, the hangover, right? Yes. Really similar. Yeah. I mean, do you find that
*  story? Yeah. It's a fucking crazy story. These kids are just trying to smoke a little weed,
*  escape from life. Tiger found an abandoned house by person who just wanted to smoke pot.
*  That's crazy. Yeah. That's tiger baby. That's tigers in Texas. That's so awesome. So listen, man.
*  It's been an honor having you on. I really, I'm glad we finally got a chance to do it. And let's
*  get you out. I want to get you out with John Dudley, take you out on one of these hunts that we do.
*  It'd be great. I'd love to do some. Let everybody know if you have social media. I do. I do.
*  I'm on Instagram, Dakota Meyer, 0317. I'm on Facebook, Dakota Meyer. So yeah. And all the
*  information about all these things you're involved with is all there. Absolutely. All of it's there.
*  Beautiful. Thank you, brother. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks so much, man. Appreciate it. Bye everybody.
