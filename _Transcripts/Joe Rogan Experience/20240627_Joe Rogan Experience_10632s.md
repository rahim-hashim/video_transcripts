# JRE MMA Show #134 with Belal Muhammad
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6.0s)]
*  What's happening brother? How you doing? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10.0s)]
*  Good man, how you been? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=15.0s)]
*  Very good to see you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=16.0s)]
*  Excited man. It's one of those milestones that you achieve. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=17.0s)]
*  Oh, coming on here? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=21.0s)]
*  I get to talk to Joe Rogan. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=22.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. That's hilarious man. It's an honor to have you on. I appreciate you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=23.0s)]
*  I appreciate you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=28.0s)]
*  I'm a big fan. You're in a great spot right now man. You're on the run. You're there. You're at the fucking door. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=29.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's been a long road. When I look back at it, where I've been, where I'm at right now, I still don't even believe it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=37.0s)]
*  But I still need to get over that hurdle where people still don't believe in you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=44.0s)]
*  People are still looking for excuses of why you beat this guy, why you beat that guy, why you don't deserve the title shot. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=49.0s)]
*  But isn't that always the case and then all of a sudden you're the fucking man? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=54.0s)]
*  That was Charles Olivera. For the longest time people thought he falls apart, he falls apart. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=58.0s)]
*  Then all of a sudden everybody had to go, you know what, he's the fucking man. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=63.0s)]
*  Until Islam got a hold of him, he was a completely different entity than he was back when Cubs Swanson knocked him out. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=66.0s)]
*  Yeah, when you look at the way his career is, the way, people don't give him enough credit for that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=75.0s)]
*  And the way he dominated some of the best guys once he was in his title reign. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=79.0s)]
*  When he beat Gagey, the way he beat Chandler, my god. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=83.0s)]
*  But now people know how good Islam is. People are respecting him the same way I feel like. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=87.0s)]
*  I'm not getting respected. And then now when he plays with him like that, beats him on the feet and then finishes him on the ground. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=92.0s)]
*  I think that now people are realizing, alright well, Islam isn't all talk. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=98.0s)]
*  Like when DC and all of them are saying that, like he's going to be better than Habib, now they're realizing it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=102.0s)]
*  Anybody said it was all talk is a fool. If you watch the way he submitted Drew Dober, he just smooshed him. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=107.0s)]
*  I'm like there was no getting up there. It was just a matter of time before he put the smoosh down on him. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=113.0s)]
*  Training with those guys, I tell people, I'm like if you never train with the guys from Dagestan, from somebody on their team, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=119.0s)]
*  you don't know what it feels like. It's not regular jiu-jitsu. It's like quicksand where you're in there, you think you're moving, you're looking for a way out. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=125.0s)]
*  You know, I'm really good at flow rolling and everything and I'm training with them at my last camp and I'm like, I cannot move with these guys. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=133.0s)]
*  None of them. Like everybody on their team has that same style, same pressure on top and I'm feeling it and I'm like, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=140.0s)]
*  I need to change what I do in Chicago. I need to change what I'm doing because these guys are so dominant with the way they play, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=147.0s)]
*  the way they grapple. It's like they're going to beat everybody. Nobody's going to mess with them. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=152.0s)]
*  What is the difference? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=156.0s)]
*  Well, for the mentality I think is the big thing too. You know, when you're rolling with somebody new, you'll get a flow roll with them, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=158.0s)]
*  you'll play around to see how they're feeling. With them, they don't have that at all. I'm not going to lose a round, I'm not going to lose a minute when I'm going against you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=166.0s)]
*  If this is our first time rolling with each other, I'm going to my back, starting on my back and I'm like, alright, let's move. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=173.0s)]
*  So I'm trying to play like guard, trying to go for iron bar or anything like that and then Khabib is just yelling, get up! We're not playing jiu-jitsu. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=180.0s)]
*  This is get up. This is MMA. We're not playing jiu-jitsu. You're on your back, you're losing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=186.0s)]
*  And their mentality is, let me hold you down because I'm not going to lose this round. I'm going to stay on top of you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=191.0s)]
*  I don't care if I'm in your guard the whole time and I'm just staying on top of you with pressure. You just lost. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=196.0s)]
*  Even though the round's over, I'm sitting there like, man, we haven't done anything. It's like I'm just laying on my back. You haven't done any pressure, no ground upon or anything. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=201.0s)]
*  But I just lost because I'm on my back. And I figured that's their mentality. They don't want to lose any round in practice. They don't want to lose any minute in grappling. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=207.0s)]
*  If they get taken down, they're popping right back up. Let me get taken down. Let me play on my back a little bit. Let me flow a little bit like that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=216.0s)]
*  Nons. Rough, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard. And I think that's what transfers their mentality into the cage when there's no, let me warm up here. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=222.0s)]
*  It's like right into it. Khabib goes in there, he grabs you, he holds you down. You never felt it before because his strength is another level. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=232.0s)]
*  And that's why I feel like a lot of these guys break once they feel it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=238.0s)]
*  I would be really interested to see. I mean, the best guy off his back, arguably in the lightweight division, is Olivera. And Olivera really couldn't do anything with Islam. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=242.0s)]
*  I mean, he really, he gave some difficulties. He made it, he got into the second round. It was like, it was work. But he didn't really threaten. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=253.0s)]
*  Where he threatens everybody off his back. That's the thing about Olivera is like, he'll catch you on the feet and he'll trade with you on the feet because if you drop him, he like gladly goes to his back to invite you into his guard. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=264.0s)]
*  But with Islam, he couldn't do a damn thing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=275.0s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of those guys before Islam were afraid to go to the ground with him. Like, Gachey dropped him a couple of times, Chandler dropped him and like they stood up because you had that fear with Islam. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=278.0s)]
*  It was like, I don't care. He's going to feel what it is on the ground. Like they always say, Sambo is better than Jiu Jitsu. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=287.0s)]
*  And he just has that mentality. Like, I want to beat you at your own game. And the way he tapped him out from half guard with that arm trying. I'm like, nobody's ever treated Olivera like that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=292.0s)]
*  That squeeze must be another level. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=302.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was rolling with, I would roll with them. And that first week, he's catching me with like an Anaconda choke every time I'm going with him. And it's just squeezing, squeezing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=304.0s)]
*  I'm like tapping and then Islam is nice. So like he'll tell you like you need to do it. You need to do it this way. And he'll show me the technique with it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=312.0s)]
*  When Habib is on top of you, he's like breaking me at every single point. I'm asking him for it. No, brother, you just got to keep going. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=319.0s)]
*  And I was like, all right, cool. So the next time he does it, he's just on top of me again. He's like mounting me. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=325.0s)]
*  Then I'm turning, giving him my back. And then he's like just laughing as he's talking to the guys outside of the cage as he's on top of me. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=331.0s)]
*  And I'm feeling like disrespected. But it's like this is not Habib. But at least like Islam, he'll be like, brother, do this way. Do this. This is the way you get out of it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=335.0s)]
*  He's giving you some tips. Yeah. So by the third week, he wasn't catching me with any more. But his squeeze is a different type of squeeze. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=344.0s)]
*  They have a very, very disciplined camp, right? Like you have to have your hair cut a certain way. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=351.0s)]
*  Like you can't be fucking around showing up with blue mohawks or nothing crazy. Like it's very disciplined, right? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=356.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's one of the reasons why they're all successful. I feel like when Habib walks into the room, it's like an army. We all get up. We all stand in line. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=363.0s)]
*  He'll stand in line. He'll point to who's sparring hard in the cage because it's a different type of sparring too. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=373.0s)]
*  Where normally for us, we have a sparring day in Chicago or most teams I've trained at will have a sparring day like Monday or Wednesday. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=379.0s)]
*  Whereas for them, they're doing everything every day. It's small gloves sparring every day. Then right after that, you're taking off the gloves and you're grappling every day. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=385.0s)]
*  Then right after that, you're going in the cage and you're wrestling on the cage every single day. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=391.0s)]
*  Small gloves sparring every day. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=395.0s)]
*  But it's light. So it's where you're not trying to knock each other out. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=397.0s)]
*  But then if he points to you that you're going to your hard sparring, hard sparring, then you're going in the cage with big gloves on. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=403.0s)]
*  And those guys are going hard and he's cornering and then Javier Mendez is in there cornering. So you're getting that real fight feel. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=408.0s)]
*  For me, I was down there with him for five weeks. So Javier would corner his guy and my coach Louis Taylor was down there with me in Dubai and he would corner me. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=415.0s)]
*  So it's like it's a real fight feel. The guys outside of the cage will sit their peak in. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=424.0s)]
*  So you get those little nerves that you would get in a fight. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=429.0s)]
*  And I'm sparring with somebody, his cousin Abou Becker, who's also in the UFC welterweight. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=432.0s)]
*  You're sparring with somebody really not used to. So you also still have that tension that you feel like, I don't know what this guy's going to do. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=437.0s)]
*  He's not one of my normal training partners where I know, well, he's got a good left kick or he got a good cross. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=443.0s)]
*  I know what he's going to bring to the table. It's like, no, it's a real fight feel every single time because I don't know what he's going to bring to the table. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=448.0s)]
*  He doesn't know what I'm going to bring to the table. And we have two corners cornering each other in there. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=454.0s)]
*  So when it's your hard sparring, you're in the cage. When it's not hard sparring, you're outside of the cage. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=459.0s)]
*  You're doing a little bit of technique, then it's light sparring going. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=463.0s)]
*  So was this camp going there and training there for five weeks? Is that just a big change in the way you look at things and like an eye opening experience? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=468.0s)]
*  Yeah, because, you know, I'm a guy that I like to cross train a lot. I'll go to a bunch of different gyms. I've been to San Fernando, I've been to Fortis. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=477.0s)]
*  I've been to Canada before to train with Fros hobby. And I want to get bring that knowledge back to my team and back to my coaches. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=485.0s)]
*  Yo, these teams are successful. This is what they're doing. This is what we got to start doing too, because we're a small gym in Chicago. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=492.0s)]
*  And, you know, we had a real champion, Juliana Pena with us. But still, you have to keep evolving. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=498.0s)]
*  You have to keep trying to do what the best teams are doing and seeing how their team is, how disciplined they are. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=504.0s)]
*  It's like none of the guys are going to show up late to practice. You're not going to show up late and smile and laugh. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=509.0s)]
*  It's like once he lines everybody up, you better sprint there in that line because it's going to tell you what your duties are for that day. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=513.0s)]
*  And then when it's grappling, every single one of those guys is an amazing grappler. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=519.0s)]
*  There's guys in there that you don't even know their name. They're still young, 19 years old, 18 years old. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=524.0s)]
*  They're just starting, but they still had the same type of grappling as could be. They still feel super strong. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=529.0s)]
*  And I'm like, who the heck is this guy? So I'll look up his name and I'll be like, oh, 12 and 0, 15 and 0, 16 and 0. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=534.0s)]
*  And the whole team is full of killers. But I just want to bring their mentality, I think, is a different type of mentality that a lot of gyms don't have of, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=540.0s)]
*  being more disciplined. And I think that comes from being Muslim. I think a lot of it comes from that is it just being religious. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=548.0s)]
*  You're bringing a different type of discipline where you have to pray five times a day and every single one of the guys is doing that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=555.0s)]
*  None of their guys are drinking. None of their guys are going out and partying. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=560.0s)]
*  If there's guys that come to practice and they look a little bit tired, could be able to take their phone away from them. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=563.0s)]
*  And he won't give it to them until the next day, tomorrow morning. So he'll take their phone at night, 9 p.m. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=569.0s)]
*  And then you have to go to sleep, get a good night's sleep. And then next practice, he'll give you your phone back because you're probably on your phone all night playing games or something stupid. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=574.0s)]
*  And he pays attention to those things. And the fact that he wants you to win that bad because he doesn't need to be there. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=581.0s)]
*  He doesn't need to give you the knowledge. He doesn't need to care that much about you if you don't care about yourself. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=588.0s)]
*  But it just shows you how much of a great person he is, too. And it just makes you want to work that much harder for him. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=592.0s)]
*  Well, just being around someone who is if he's not the goat, I mean, is there a goat? I don't know. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=599.0s)]
*  It might be Mighty Mouse. It might be John Jones. It could be Khabib. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=605.0s)]
*  It's in the car. There's a conversation to be had for many fighters when they're in their prime. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=609.0s)]
*  Like, but Khabib is the first one to really retire completely undefeated, where you can make the argument that even the rounds he lost, if he lost like one round against Connor, maybe one round, another point in his career, there were barely. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=615.0s)]
*  Barely. There were like coasting rounds where he just like was refreshing himself and then comes back and dominates. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=627.0s)]
*  Yeah. So if you're training with a guy like that, like, fuck, man. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=633.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that that's a big thing, too, is, you know, one time we were training in Vegas and I have a Moroccan kickboxer that I trained with and we were down there training with Khabib's team. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=638.0s)]
*  And he's sparring one of their guys and, you know, he's a great kickboxer and their guy's obviously a great grappler, but he has striking. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=648.0s)]
*  So the first round, he's taking my guy down, beating him on the ground. And the second and third round, he's like, gonna be striking with him a little bit because the ground is kind of like too easy. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=656.0s)]
*  So he's striking with him. My guy's landing hard kicks, hard punches, hard knees. And it could be just like stops him and like snaps at him. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=663.0s)]
*  Like, you took him down, you treated him like a baby. Like, why are you going to sit there and kickbox with a kickboxer? I don't care if this is practice. I don't care if this is sparring. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=669.0s)]
*  The goal is to win. If you want to look stupid, you want to be dumb, then go against the plan. Go against the route that's going to help you win. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=676.0s)]
*  He's like, and that like open your eyes to it's like he knows the path to victory. All the guys know the path to victory. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=682.0s)]
*  It's hard grappling, heavy grappling and strength on the ground. It's like, why are you going to be dumb and spar with the Moroccan kickboxer for and take that damage? Yeah, ego. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=689.0s)]
*  Yeah, he knows a motherfucker. Yeah, it really is. So many guys just decided trade with people for no reason and they wind up getting lit up when they really should be taking the guy down. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=698.0s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like that's what a lot of these newer guys coming up. I was training with Ohio State wrestler. He was in Vegas visiting and he was like going to transition into MMA. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=707.0s)]
*  And he was telling me like, yeah, you know, I like this gym, but you know, in wrestling, I'm killing the guys. But then I don't know nothing about sparring. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=717.0s)]
*  So on sparring day, I'm telling you guys, you know, it's I'm still learning. And then he said, everybody trying to throw hard at me because I'm killing them in wrestling. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=725.0s)]
*  And I'm like, you got to find a gym where the guys don't have egos, where they're going to try to help you build yourself. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=731.0s)]
*  Because if you're sparring hard and you don't really know how to take a punch or anything, you're only going to hurt yourself. Right. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=736.0s)]
*  And you're going to get your ticket punched too many times. And then by the time you get into fights, I mean, there's quite a few guys that I know that by the time they have their first or second pro fight, they've already had six, seven concussions in the gym. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=740.0s)]
*  You know, and like, man, like you already had a deficit. Yeah. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=751.0s)]
*  I look at when I go to gyms and I see guys like they're laughing about it. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=755.0s)]
*  Like, oh, I gave I knocked Chris out yesterday, man. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=758.0s)]
*  And I'm I'm looking at it like, like, why is that what you guys do? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=761.0s)]
*  And it's it changes my mentality because when I'm first coming up, I used to like, would spar like 15 minute rounds, just not stop boxing. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=765.0s)]
*  And I'm now when I think back to it, I'm like, it was so stupid because I know how to take a punch. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=774.0s)]
*  Why am I going to take a punch at practice when I'm not getting paid for it? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=779.0s)]
*  Like build the skills. And if you find the right training partners, I feel like I have like the perfect training partners where we spar super light and we're still getting that same movement, that same fluidity with the striking, with the speed, with everything. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=782.0s)]
*  But we're not putting an extra on it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=795.0s)]
*  And if you can't, if you don't have any guys like that in your gym, I think a lot of these guys are going to have shorter careers or they're going to get broken a lot earlier than they should have. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=797.0s)]
*  It makes a big difference with timing, too. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=806.0s)]
*  Like you really develop timing when you get a guy who's willing to spar light with you, because then you're not thinking about the consequences of missing or getting countered. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=808.0s)]
*  And you could really just develop that ingrained timing and occasionally hard sparring. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=816.0s)]
*  Yeah, but hard sparring all the time. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=821.0s)]
*  I mean, the early days of the UFC guys would just fight. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=824.0s)]
*  They would go into the ring and in their their whatever their gym was and they would beat the fucking shit out of each other. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=827.0s)]
*  And somewhere along the line, people realize like, hey, this is you can only sustain this for so long. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=833.0s)]
*  You're not going to have a long career doing this and you're not going to reach the best of your potential. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=838.0s)]
*  Like when you look at all the variables that take place in a person reaching their full potential, I think one of the things you're doing that's really good is going to different places. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=843.0s)]
*  I think that has a big factor that make that's a big factor. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=852.0s)]
*  And being exposed yourself to the guys like for us, a hobby or Khabib or all these other different minds that can give you a different approach and you can take a little bit here and a little bit there. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=855.0s)]
*  But also it's like being smart in your training and knowing when when to push and when not when you're being a bitch and when you're actually being a meathead because you're just going too hard and you're fucking your body up. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=865.0s)]
*  Yeah. And a lot of guys had to learn that the hard way where it takes them like, you know, when you're coming up, you're fighting for pennies. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=876.0s)]
*  You're not you're not fighting for anything. I used to fight for one hundred fifty dollars and I'll tell my family, no, I'm making like fifteen thousand. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=885.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was there and lied to them. But it's because you had that dream. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=891.0s)]
*  You had that push and I had to end goal where I knew I was going to make it or I felt like I could have made it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=896.0s)]
*  So when I had you got to have, I think, leaders in the gym room that are going to teach you the right things, because if you have those guys in those bigger gyms, I feel like there's so many UFC fighters in their 20, 30, 40 guys. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=901.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's great training partners, great things. But if it's a guy like trying to come up on the come up or anything like that, they're going to use you as a body for them. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=914.0s)]
*  And they're going to beat you up. And who are you going to talk to? You're going to talk to the coach. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=922.0s)]
*  But the coach is like, well, this guy pays me more. So I'm going to stick with him. So you just go in there, give him some rounds. Keep it quiet. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=925.0s)]
*  Like nobody, nobody really cares what you have to say. So I think smaller gyms are better for that. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=932.0s)]
*  And for me, I had my coach, Louis Taylor. He was a fighter. And when I when he when I came in, I was 23 years old when I first started fighting and he was already a veteran in the game. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=938.0s)]
*  He was in it. So like he I was following his footsteps and he was teaching me all the small things. Don't go to that boxing gym. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=949.0s)]
*  What are you going to go to that boxing gym for? Boxers hate MMA fighters. They're going to just try to knock you out. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=954.0s)]
*  And I would sit there, go on my own a little bit like, you know, let me just see how it is because ego. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=959.0s)]
*  Then you go over there and they're just trying to knock you out. And it's like, what did I gain from that? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=964.0s)]
*  It's just it's hard sparring, but it was like I didn't really gain any skill level. I gained toughness, but it's not really going to help me when I need better footwork. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=968.0s)]
*  I need better defense. I need better. They are still on the come up learning. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=977.0s)]
*  So just getting beat up is not going to help me. Yeah. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=980.0s)]
*  The small gym versus the large gym. That's the big debate because some people think a place like American Top Team, they have dormitories. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=982.0s)]
*  You got all these guys coming in from Russia and Morocco and all these all these places, all parts of the world. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=989.0s)]
*  They're coming to American Top Team. And, you know, you might get some sparring with some fucking killers. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=995.0s)]
*  But how many coaches are really paying attention to you when you're just a guy who just started out there? Is this a good place to develop? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1000.0s)]
*  Are you running the risk of being injured because you're just going to war every day versus a small gym where you get individualized attention and people are really paying attention to you? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1007.0s)]
*  But then it's like, which small gym? Like every small gym is different. Some small gyms are really good. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1017.0s)]
*  Some small gyms, the guys are on point. They have a deep well of knowledge and they can really coach you. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1022.0s)]
*  Some small gyms, the guys kind of out of his league and, you know, he's bringing guys to the UFC and giving them shitty advice. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1027.0s)]
*  I mean, you've you've seen guys in the corner give shit advice and you hear this guy like he's not giving any technical advice at all. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1033.0s)]
*  This dude is like he's doing things. He's making mistakes and he's not getting any coaching. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1039.0s)]
*  He's getting like, go out there and fucking win. Go out there and kick his ass. Like, what? He doesn't. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1044.0s)]
*  Don't you think he already knows that? He knows that already. So that's a bad small gym. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1048.0s)]
*  You know, it's really finding the right place and finding the right place is so crucial. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1052.0s)]
*  It's so crucial and finding the right training partner. So crucial. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1056.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the key honestly is training partners. You have to have the right guys that really care for you because I've been at gyms where guys really don't care if you win or lose. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1060.0s)]
*  But if you have that family feel where they're going to be in the gym for you no matter what and they're going to push for you and they're going to watch your opponent and give you that opponent's look like in bigger gyms. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1068.0s)]
*  In bigger gyms, if I'm a UFC fighter and you're a UFC fighter and you're telling me I'm fighting Wonderboy and in my smaller gym, I had every single one of my five guys that I've trained with, all of them try to give me that Wonderboy look. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1077.0s)]
*  They're all paying attention to the way he does. Hey, I think he does this extra. In a bigger gym, they're like, I'm not a karate guy. I'm going to give you what I got. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1087.0s)]
*  Like you want this or not. I got to get paid too unless you're going to pay me for it. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1093.0s)]
*  But that's what I love about the smaller gyms is because I fought Damian Maia. I didn't have one black belt in my gym. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1098.0s)]
*  I didn't have one black belt that was helping me push or grapple. So I had the mindset of I have great wrestlers that I'm training with. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1104.0s)]
*  Every single one of my guys is a great wrestler. So I will let's just not hit the ground. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1111.0s)]
*  Let's just push my wrestling so hard that he's going to tire himself out trying to take me down. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1114.0s)]
*  So I don't have to overthink it, the situation. When I fought Wonderboy, I was I've been in camp with Anthony Pettis when he fought Wonderboy. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1120.0s)]
*  I've been in camp with Woodley when he fought Wonderboy and Woodley brought in Sage Northcutt. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1127.0s)]
*  Anthony Pettis was using Mike Bigger Rhodes and they have that karate style. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1132.0s)]
*  But for me, I asked Anthony like, so you think I should bring somebody in? He's like, honestly, just watch this tape. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1136.0s)]
*  It was, I forgot who it was. It was kickboxer that fought Raymond Daniels. And he's like, lit him up. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1142.0s)]
*  And he's like, watch this. Nicky Holtskin. Yeah. And he was like, watch this. And he's like, lit him up. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  And he's like, just follow that routine. Because it was Valtellini. It might have been Valtellini. Yeah. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1154.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was Valtellini. Yeah. Yeah. Because he showed me the tape and I was watching. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1159.0s)]
*  I was just rewatching it. Just the pressure he gave and everything like that. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1162.0s)]
*  And I just wanted to mimic that because he's like, yeah, I had a karate style guy, but Wonderboy is different, man. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1165.0s)]
*  His kicks are a lot snappier than you think. His spinning kick is a lot snappier than you think. His angles are a lot different. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1170.0s)]
*  So he said, don't try to overthink mimicking him. Just stick with what you got and do what you're good at. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1175.0s)]
*  Was he the most puzzling guy that you fought? Yeah, I think so. I like I never even wanted that fight. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1181.0s)]
*  I was telling my manager, I was like, bro, give me Tchumayev. I was like, because also just that Wonderboy is a guy you can't hate. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1186.0s)]
*  I always love watching Wonderboy fight. He's the nicest guy in the world. The nicest guy in the world. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1195.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you got to find a reason to hit him and dislike him. And just like his highlight reel. And I'm looking at it. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1199.0s)]
*  Like I said, I was in two camps watching these guys and they're telling me like, he's nothing like these other guys. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1206.0s)]
*  His like kicks are snappier. It hurts so much. And you're seeing him. I'm like, man, I do not want to be on his highlight reel. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1211.0s)]
*  I do not want to get hit with a spinning heel kick. And he was coming off of a loss. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1216.0s)]
*  And I feel like guys coming off of one loss is their mentality is different. They're that much hungrier. Yeah. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1220.0s)]
*  Where they want to get it right back. I was so impressed with him and Kevin Holland fight. That Kevin Holland fight was amazing. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1225.0s)]
*  Yeah, but mentality like I said, Kevin Holland, I'm like, bro, you took him to the ground. Right. Why are you going to stand up for? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1231.0s)]
*  They made an agreement apparently to not go to the ground. Like Kevin, you're a black belt in jujitsu and you're like in the top 10 of the division. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1237.0s)]
*  Like what are you doing, man? Like you really could be a contender, a top contender. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1248.0s)]
*  Literally. And beating a guy like Wonderboy, that name value right there. You see where he wants to push you. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1253.0s)]
*  You have a good push behind you with Holland. So I'm like, you beat Wonderboy. You could probably be right there in the next line for the title shot. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1258.0s)]
*  Actually, I don't know if he's top 10 at welterweight, but the fight was supposedly scheduled at that was a welterweight fight, right? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1266.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was a welterweight. But Wonderboy is ranked top 10. So he probably took his number if he beat him. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1273.0s)]
*  Yeah, that fight was crazy because I just I just couldn't imagine why he wouldn't want to vary his approach when you're fighting with a 57 and oh kickboxer. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1277.0s)]
*  I had so many people have messaged me after my fight with him like, bro, you're all you did was hump him. All you did was bro. He's 57 and oh kickboxer. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1290.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then after the job, yeah, they're like, he's old. He's this. He's this. And I'm like, whoa, look, he beat Holland and striking. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1299.0s)]
*  So I guess he's still got some fight left in him. He's not done. I'm like that old and he doesn't take a lot of damage himself. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1308.0s)]
*  He's been knocked out once by that was it. Well, he got dropped really bad by Woodley Tyron heard him bad. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1314.0s)]
*  And, you know, that was that's the way you have to fight him. If you're a guy like Tyron, like everybody's like that fight was boring. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1321.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, that's smart. Yeah. You have to fight him smart. You can't just charge at that, dude. You're crazy. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1327.0s)]
*  He's so good at countering and he moves like a snake. Yeah, he moves back and forth like a snake the way pops back and then pops back in when he's beating guys like Lukey and he's being Jeff Neal. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1332.0s)]
*  And he's like making them look like amateurs. They all wanted to play that. Let me I'm going to strike with you. I'm going to strike with you doing that game. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1343.0s)]
*  And you can't beat him at that game. There's that karate stance is so different. Everything is movement. Yeah. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1349.0s)]
*  I mean, his his sideways stance and then attacking you with that front leg. Everything's different. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1355.0s)]
*  And it's from it's like so sophisticated. Like we can hit you with this and bring it over the top. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1360.0s)]
*  And he's like when I first came out, I threw one spinning heel kick at me. I'm like, I'm shooting. I'm not. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1365.0s)]
*  I'm not going to play this game. I'm like, and then when I took him down, they just started giving me building the confidence, building the confidence, building the confidence. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1370.0s)]
*  So like, all right. Well, my wrestling is up there where people beforehand were like, Johnny Hendrix couldn't take him down. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1376.0s)]
*  Johnny Hendrix, the national champion, Woodley couldn't take him down. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1383.0s)]
*  Johnny Hendrix when he fought Wonder Boy was on the slide. Yeah. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1386.0s)]
*  Like there was a big slide with Johnny Hendrix was Johnny Hendrix versus GSP, who was a motherfucker. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1391.0s)]
*  There was the Johnny Hendrix that knocked out John Fitch and Marvin Camp Martin Campman. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1398.0s)]
*  Like that Johnny Hendrix was a bad motherfucker. He was a beast. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1403.0s)]
*  But by the time Johnny Hendrix got to like Paul Ocosta, that Johnny Hendrix was done. Yeah, he was done. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1407.0s)]
*  I don't know what was going on in his personal life. I don't know how hard he was training. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1414.0s)]
*  I don't know if you saw it. It got to him. I don't know what happened, but he was not the same guy. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1418.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's one of the main guys where that you saw it comes in here like, do you remember he's how do you fall off that much? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1423.0s)]
*  Yeah, guys senseless. Yeah, go flying that guy's like Wood Fitch. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1428.0s)]
*  He cracked him and Fitch goes flying. Everybody goes flying. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1433.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden the power goes away. Yeah, wild. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1437.0s)]
*  And then you're thinking back to the GSP fight where it's like, how could somebody be that good? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1440.0s)]
*  Right. And like somebody who almost beat the goat. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1445.0s)]
*  A lot of people say they go in all of a sudden you fall off that much and it's only like two years, three years later. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1448.0s)]
*  Right. Real close to beating him. Yeah. Maybe you could have given it to him. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1453.0s)]
*  Like if I mean, that wouldn't have been the most egregious decision. Yeah. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1456.0s)]
*  Yeah, Crosby would have for sure gave it to him. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1460.0s)]
*  Ha! Who knows? He might have given George every round. Who fucking knows? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1462.0s)]
*  Yeah, man, there's some bad judging, right? There's so some of those fights were like, what in the fuck are you guys watching? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1467.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Thinking back to the Patty fight. I'm like, I'm getting tagged in all the videos with you and her like, we're looking at each other. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1474.0s)]
*  We're both looking at each other. I said to you right before I go, he got it. I go, Jared got him. Yeah. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1482.0s)]
*  And we both agreed. And then I looked at you like, what the fuck? That didn't make any sense. I thought it was two to one. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1486.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. And I'm rewatching it. I'm like, I'll go back and I rewatch it. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1492.0s)]
*  And I'm sitting there like, I still give it to Jared. And it's like no bias involved. Obviously there may be, but I'm like, just stats. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1495.0s)]
*  Yeah. Just stats. Like you're looking at the stats. He outstruck him 21 to like 16 in the first round. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1503.0s)]
*  And he took him down and all the judges gave still the first round to Patty. I'm like, how? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1507.0s)]
*  It didn't make any sense. And he caught him clean with that left hook. He was landing that left hook on a regular basis. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1511.0s)]
*  All day. Very clean. Yeah. Yeah. He got fucked. And that's unfortunate. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1516.0s)]
*  You know, I don't like when someone gets by just because they're famous and they have this big personality and everybody loves them. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1520.0s)]
*  The problem with that is people are going to be rooting against him now in the next fight. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1527.0s)]
*  And so now he's going to go in there against someone and maybe he's going to go in against someone who's on another level, like one more level up. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1531.0s)]
*  And he's going to be in trouble. Yeah. And for a guy like him, I just don't think that he really wants it that bad. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1538.0s)]
*  If you're going out of camp and you're getting up to 200 pounds to 210 and you're getting that big, you're not in the training room. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1544.0s)]
*  For me, I'm in the pecs room all day. I don't care if I have a fight or not a fight. And it's just building skills in between fights. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1551.0s)]
*  Him, I'm looking at it. I was watching the fight for Jared because I knew I was going to be in his corner. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1557.0s)]
*  So I'm watching tape and I'm like, he's going to be the same exact fighter that left hook is going to land all day. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1561.0s)]
*  His coach, very smart, was like that left hook, that left hook, that left hook. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1565.0s)]
*  And it landed the whole fight because he didn't evolve from his second fight, his third fight, his first fight. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1569.0s)]
*  Because yeah, someone said that too, that his fights are like fat camps. Yeah. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1574.0s)]
*  They're really not like training camps where you're going over skills as much as he's just he's got very good skills. Yeah. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1579.0s)]
*  But now he's just trying to lose weight. Yeah, you just got to lose it. He gets so big. He gets so big, his big pie face. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1585.0s)]
*  I mean, you can make a show about it and play that whole game. It gets a fad for you. But in general, it's not good for your health. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1590.0s)]
*  And if you're training with that much extra weight on you, that's when little injuries happen. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1599.0s)]
*  He's going into surgery now. So I'm wondering if that played a part into it. What's he going to surgery for? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1603.0s)]
*  I don't know. They said he's not going to be on the March card because he has surgery, the London card. Oh, no shit. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1608.0s)]
*  Yeah. See what the Patty Pimblitt is getting surgery on. He's a fun dude, though, man. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1612.0s)]
*  His fucking personality and the way he dances when he gets inside the octagon and everything. It's very fun. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1617.0s)]
*  But sometimes ankle surgery. But sometimes you can be more famous than you are good. Yeah. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1622.0s)]
*  And that's a real problem when you run up against a Justin Gaethje or some fucking assassin. Yeah. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1629.0s)]
*  And that's what I feel like he has to level up from Jared. So yeah, leveling up from Jared, I think is probably like top 15. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1636.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. A partial tear of his ligaments in his ankle. Hmm. Something like that. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1643.0s)]
*  It says a grade two injury to the ankle rehabilitation. Pemblitz doctor disagree with the UFC lightweight, continues to deal with swelling and soreness more than a month removed from his most recent fight. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1649.0s)]
*  I wonder if he looked into stem cells at all. Well, who knows? Either way, he's getting surgery. Yeah. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1660.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I hope he heals up. But I hope he realizes that. I mean, he's openly talked about having an eating disorder. Yeah. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1666.0s)]
*  You know, and some guys do get that when they cut a ton of weight and it really fucks with them. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1674.0s)]
*  And you always have that mentality. Like when you're in camp and it's about to be like two or three weeks out and you feel so good because you're eating healthy for six to eight weeks. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1679.0s)]
*  Like your body feels good. Your energy feels good. I always tell myself like after this fight, I'm not eating bad. I'm not going to go on any bad binges or anything. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1688.0s)]
*  But it's like right after you win, you're like, I don't care no more. I'm eating whatever I want. Yeah. You're like, I'll make up for it. But it only has to be for me. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1694.0s)]
*  I only give myself a week. If you go one week. Yeah. You go to two to three to four weeks and week must be glorious though. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1701.0s)]
*  It's like heaven. And especially if you're winning. And for me, I was like, I was flying back from Dubai from Abu Dhabi and I was like, I'm upgrading the business class. I'm going to do business class. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1708.0s)]
*  I got me like a big bag of M&Ms. I'm just sitting there front row. My brother was able to sneak up there with me in business class. It was like empty seats and they never asked him. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1718.0s)]
*  So he sat up there the whole time with me. So me and my coach are just sitting up there eating M&Ms. Yeah. Oh, let me get some French toast. Let me get this. It was like the best ride ever. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1727.0s)]
*  What's your binge food? The one binge food that you like to go to after a fight? I love nachos. Yeah, I'm a nacho guy. I'm chips and cheese. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1735.0s)]
*  Like when I'm in Vegas one time, I was on the same, me and Anthony Pettis, we were training together and we both won that on a card together. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1743.0s)]
*  And he comes up to me and he's like, Hey, we're going to go to the club at, I don't know what even name of the club was. And he was like, all right, we're going to get a table over there. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1750.0s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, I'm going to go get a nacho daddy. I'm going to go get some nachos. And he's like, looked at me like I was such a loser. And my coach, my coach is like, bro, you're such a lame. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1758.0s)]
*  And I was like, cause I don't drink or party or anything, but my family's always had all the fights with me. So my best time is celebrating with them, going to eat with them. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1766.0s)]
*  So he's looking at me like, you're a lame man. And I was like, bro, let's go eat. And he's like, all right, man, let's go. Let's go together. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1773.0s)]
*  Well, it's probably adding time to your career by not drinking. You're probably adding time to your career. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1779.0s)]
*  Yeah. So it's like drinking's fun. There's a reason why people like to do it. There's a reason why bars are everywhere. It's fun. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1785.0s)]
*  But the reality is it's fucking terrible for you. And if you're a professional athlete and you're in this world of professional athleticism that has very little room for error, which is what you're in. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1792.0s)]
*  I mean, you're in the hardest fucking sport, I think, in the world. And if you can maximize your recovery and maximize your health and maximize your vitality by not drinking alcohol, I would tell people to do it. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1805.0s)]
*  Maybe a glass of wine here and there, a little glass of whiskey, no big deal. But guys who get drunk, guys who really like to party and drink, you are fucking chipping away at your health. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1820.0s)]
*  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Yeah. I mean, I know a lot of guys that do it. And then they'll come into the practice room on Monday or hungover or something. You're not really getting as much out of the session. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1831.0s)]
*  And you get hurt. Yeah. And I've seen it happen to a lot of guys. And I tell them, like, how bad do you want it? How serious you want it? These younger fighters. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1841.0s)]
*  And I tell them, like, it's not an easy road. Everybody always asks me for advice. How do you get to the UFC? And I'm like, there's no easy road to the UFC. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1848.0s)]
*  There's some people that will skyrocket right in there. Like you said, they're famous. They got a following behind them and they're going to blow up right away. Or there's guys that have to inch their way in. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1857.0s)]
*  Guys like you that grind. Yeah. You've worked your way through contender after contender after contender. You've been grinding, dude. Yeah. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1866.0s)]
*  I appreciate that, though, man. That's a mentality that I really appreciate because it's hard to do. And no one has to tell you that. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1875.0s)]
*  When you're not making these monumental leaps in terms of like public consciousness and being celebrated, you're steady up that fucking ladder. That's what you're doing. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1881.0s)]
*  And that, to me, is some of the most impressive shit. Like that Sean Brady fight. That was a big fight, man. Yeah. That dude's a killer. He's a fucking killer. And you put it on him, man. You put it on him and you pressure the shit out of him. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1891.0s)]
*  That was a big fight. It was a big fight. Yeah. That was one of those fights where obviously I wanted to fight upward. I thought that I fought Luke A, who was on a seven fight on his streak, and he was number five in the world. And I beat him. And then I beat Wonderboy before that, who was number five. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1904.0s)]
*  And then you're going to offer me number eight. And I was sitting there like, this doesn't make any sense. Like Hamza's still out there. Gilbert Burns is still out there. Give me those guys. And they just weren't pushing. And they're like, well, we'll give you him. We'll give you Brady. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1918.0s)]
*  And I was like, honestly, I don't care. Why do you think they weren't? I mean, Gilbert, who's Gilbert fighting this weekend? He's fighting Magni. That's right. That's a good fight. But it's a good showcase for Gilbert in Brazil. Not that Magni's an easy fight. He's a very good fighter. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1930.0s)]
*  But it's like, neither one of those, like beating Magni is not going to move him into a title shot. Yeah. You know, because Magni hasn't really won enough fights as of late to warrant that. But beating you would. Yeah. You know, like if you beat him, that moves you closer. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1945.0s)]
*  Like it's like that's a consequential fight. Yeah. And sometimes they do consequential fights and sometimes they do fights where they like give a guy a good opponent, but give it to them in their hometown. And, you know, they have it set up. So it's nice. They offer you a fight that makes sense financially. And it looks good. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1962.0s)]
*  Just to build you up in that area. But for you, a Gilbert fight or more, more importantly, a Hamzah fight. Hamzah, you versus Hamzah would be gigantic. Yeah. And that's, I didn't get why they were undoing that one. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1979.0s)]
*  I was sitting there like, I'm asking for it. There's a million guys. He says, oh, these guys are all turning me down. I'm like, I'm not asking for extra money. I'm not telling me I need to have this, this and this. I'm like, give me that fight. And I'm showing people, I'm texting my manager. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=1991.0s)]
*  Like they don't want to do it. And I was like, Hamzah doesn't want to do it. The UFC didn't want to do it. And they were like, well, he's going to do Nate Diaz. And I was like, like, why are you going to do Nate Diaz instead of me? It doesn't make, obviously to build his name, whatever. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2004.0s)]
*  Yeah. But I was like, this has to be a joke. And then I was like, well, give me Gilbert. And they were like, well, Gilbert is going to fight Masvidal. And then I was there like, there's nobody else for you but Sean Brady. So then you're like, all right. Well, as long as it's in Abu Dhabi. I always just wanted to fight in Abu Dhabi because the first time I fought there was the crowd there was amazing. The people there were amazing. So I was like, just give me him. If you guys think that he could beat me, if you guys want to push him, he's 15 and 0 and everybody's hyping him up to be the strongest man in the world. And if he touches you, you fall. I was like, I'm going to fight him. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2017.0s)]
*  Let's do it. And I felt like after beating him and the way I beat him in that crowd, I thought for sure I'm going to get a Hamza fight after that. But they still didn't do it. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2047.0s)]
*  Well, Hamza is not scheduled to fight anybody, is he? No. Yeah. But now they're saying he could be going up to middleweight. Yeah. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2057.0s)]
*  Well, the thing about the middleweight thing is like, yeah, he could go up to middleweight and he would be a top flight middleweight. But he has fought at welterweight. Could he make the weight though? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2064.0s)]
*  That was a big problem after that fight with Kevin Holland. Like, you know, what? Why are you weighing so much? Like, why did you weigh eight pounds over? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2075.0s)]
*  And he said that they stopped him. He could have made the weight. And it's like you never know. Like, maybe they did stop him. Maybe they maybe it was the commission. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2084.0s)]
*  They looked at him and, you know, those commission guys, they don't cut weight. They don't know. You look like shit. Yeah, you always look like you look like death. You look like death. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2092.0s)]
*  Nobody's ever going to be smiling, cutting weight. Nobody's going to go. He's great. Is that eight pounds to go? Yeah, let him go. Yeah. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2101.0s)]
*  Eight pounds is a lot of fucking weight, man. But yeah, that's a lot. That's a lot. For me, I think it's just the mentality for that fight is like you're fighting Nate Diaz. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2107.0s)]
*  It's not like you have to do the extra running, the extra jogging while you're in camp. It's not like somebody that's making me want to work harder. When I fight a wonder boy, I'm working twice as hard. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2114.0s)]
*  I'm doing five practices, three practices a day, do whatever I can do because I'm so afraid of what he could do to me. Nate Diaz, you're like pretty much pretty sure you're probably going to beat him pretty easily in the first round if your ham's up. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2123.0s)]
*  So I just think that his motivation factor wasn't there. That might be it. Maybe he didn't work hard enough. Yeah. Or, you know, maybe he's just fake. It also could be he's getting close to the top of the food chain. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2136.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of pressure involved in that. And sometimes when people have a lot of pressure, they self-sabotage. There's that possibility. Yeah. You know, you really don't know. It's so hard to tell. That's why experience is so important. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2149.0s)]
*  And that's why your resume is very impressive because you fought so many top guys. You've been around for so long. You're a proven entity. Yeah. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2160.0s)]
*  And with a guy like Hamza, you go, OK, well, he looked real good up until that Gilbert Burns fight. And the Gilbert Burns fight was a fucking war. That was a war. But man showed he could take it. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2169.0s)]
*  Man showed he can bounce back from diversity, gets dropped and still drive forward and gets a takedown. I mean, he showed he's a dog. He showed he's a fucking mad dog. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2180.0s)]
*  But how many times can you do that? How many different fighters? How many? Who's going to figure you out? Who's going to find your chin? Who's going to catch you? Who's going to get your number? Who's who's going to get it? We need to know. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2190.0s)]
*  And then maybe he's thinking that after the Gilbert Burns fight. You have a fight like that where you're steamrolling everybody. You only get hit four times in your first four fights. He was just ragdolling people, man. Yeah. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2200.0s)]
*  Runs through Lee Jinglian, fucks up Gerald Merchardt, fucks up everybody. Right. And then all of a sudden he's getting tagged and Gilbert's a savage. Gilbert is a bad motherfucker. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2211.0s)]
*  And that dude was just throwing bombs at him and clipped him and hurt him and rocked him. And maybe he's thinking like, you know, who knows, man? You never know. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2221.0s)]
*  So that's why being a proven entity is so important. You get a guy like yourself that's just had so many tough fights against top contenders. Like then you could see what a guy's made of. Yeah. That's why betting lines are hard. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2229.0s)]
*  Yeah. But also with Hamza, where you're looking at that Kevin Holland fight where he just came out so hard. Oh my God. I wish we would have seen the second round. Yes. He was going for Darces, all the scrambling. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2244.0s)]
*  I'm like, nobody could keep up that pace. I don't care who you are. And how you recover in the second. Yeah. And you're not going to do that for five rounds. If you do that for a five round fight, man, and you don't get him in the first, you're fucked. Yeah. You're really fucked. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2256.0s)]
*  That fight, the extra two rounds, I tell people it's a difference. But meanwhile he was right. Yeah. See the thing is like we can second guess him all day, but Hamza was right. He knew he could do that. Yeah. He knew he could do that and he was right. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2269.0s)]
*  He ragdolled the shit out of Kevin Holland. I was impressed. I mean, I was really impressed when you see what he's capable of when he puts the fucking pedal to the gas and really just stomps it to the floor. Like that motherfucker's scary. Yeah. He's very good. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2280.0s)]
*  But that's those type of fighters are the ones that like, I want to figure out. Those are the ones that were everybody's telling me I'm going to get walked through. All right. Let me figure him out. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2295.0s)]
*  Kobe Covince is another one where Dana Wayava, if Ushman wasn't here, Kobe would be the champion. I'm like, I don't think so. Like I think Kobe sucks. I don't think that he's at as good as everybody thinks he is. You think he sucks? I think that compared to me, I think I'll be able to walk through him. I think that he's the lesser version of Sean Brady, I think. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2303.0s)]
*  Because if you look at the guys he's fought, he's being Woodley coming off of two losses, he being Mazvodil coming off of two losses, Robbie Lawler coming off of two losses. He hasn't fought one of the guys that's in the top 10 right now. He's getting so much credit for losing close fights to Ushman. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2322.0s)]
*  Like you're a good loser? Is that what people are trying to say to him? I'm like, bro, why does he get all that credit for? Because him and Ushman stood toe to toe with each other. Neither one of them went for a takedown. Neither one of them tried to shoot at each other. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2337.0s)]
*  There were just two wrestlers kickboxing. So because he made it a close kickboxing match with a wrestler makes him that much of a monster, a pomp and frown guy. I just don't think so. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2349.0s)]
*  Really interesting. I'd like to see that fight. Yeah. Does he have a scheduled fight, Kobe? He doesn't have anything yet, but he's been missing. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2359.0s)]
*  Well, he got sucker punched by Mazvodil and apparently he really got hurt from that. Yeah, I mean, I think it's hurt for court. You think so? Yeah, because I'm like, I don't know. I know people who know him. He said he actually got hurt. He was fucked up. He was fucked up for a while after that fight apparently. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2367.0s)]
*  Or after that punch. Like nerves? I don't know. I'd be talking out of my ass, but my friend who knows him well said, dude, he got really fucked up from that punch because he didn't see it coming. And Jorge just ran up to him and sucker punched him in the face. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2383.0s)]
*  But when you're that person, you have to have security with them. I'm like, all the trash talk you say, all the dumb stuff, all the people that want to kill you, I'm sure American top team, all the Brazilians you talk trash about, you don't think that somebody sees you on the street is going to hurt you. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2397.0s)]
*  And that's what I feel like a lot of these guys need to start realizing is like you could say whatever you want to build a fight. But when you're talking about a guy's family, his kids, he deserved that. I know that it was a sucker punch. It was dirty on Mazvodil's end. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2411.0s)]
*  Be a street fighter, go street fight him in the streets, hit him with something, but don't hit him and like run off. But I thought he deserved it. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2423.0s)]
*  I'm never going to kick a man when he's down, but I always kick Kobe Covins when he's down. I don't care about Kobe Covins. I've had hate for Sean Strickland. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2433.0s)]
*  And I've called him out before and I was at the fight when he fought Pereira. Pereira knocked him out. And I got up to go to the bathroom and he said, brother, stop, don't go anywhere. Don't say anything to him. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2441.0s)]
*  I was like, bro, I'm just going to the bathroom. I hate him, but I wouldn't laugh at somebody that they just got knocked out. I wouldn't go up to, oh, you just got knocked out LOL or anything like that. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2451.0s)]
*  Because I know what it is to get knocked out of the cage. I know what it is to want it that bad and be that close to achieving something and then you lose, fall flat on your face. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2460.0s)]
*  So I would never talk trash about him. But if it was Kobe, I'd probably laugh and point and everything. I don't care about Kobe. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2469.0s)]
*  So he's your number one dude that you hate. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2474.0s)]
*  Kobe, yeah. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2476.0s)]
*  Well, that's a real possibility for you. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2477.0s)]
*  If he comes back, like people just don't know. I ask, when is he fighting? Oh, he's not fighting for a year. He's going to be. He's not going to be fighting for a while. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2479.0s)]
*  And then I'm looking at it like they say why I'm assuming because he's claiming brain damage with the court case. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2486.0s)]
*  And I know like some lawyers like injury lawyers and he's like, yeah, when somebody comes in claiming brain damage, like all I hear is cha-ching. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2493.0s)]
*  I know that I'm going to get paid for it because you could claim like future injuries or anything like that, like stuff that's going to happen in the future. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2500.0s)]
*  So and the court can't do anything like, well, we'll wait 10 years before you let you get paid or anything. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2507.0s)]
*  And if you're suing Masvidal, who's worth millions of dollars and you're claiming brain damage and they see you take a fight, they're probably going to be like, why are you going to take a fight if you have brain damage? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2512.0s)]
*  That's a good point. And that's really interesting, too, is like, has there ever been a fighter that sued another fighter for a sucker punch? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2520.0s)]
*  Has that ever happened? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2527.0s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2528.0s)]
*  I don't think so either. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2529.0s)]
*  I'm thinking about it. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2530.0s)]
*  I don't think in the UFC it's ever happened before. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2531.0s)]
*  And I feel like they should be like guy code. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2533.0s)]
*  Like, right. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2535.0s)]
*  I'm not going to call the cops or anything like that. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2536.0s)]
*  Like, I'm not going to sue you off of that. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2538.0s)]
*  And for especially for them to because they had a relationship before. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2540.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2543.0s)]
*  So you were roommates for that long and you're going to sit there and go to court and sue them like that. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2544.0s)]
*  To me, that's soft. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2548.0s)]
*  Like, I'm not going to if it's if it's if I'm Kobe, I'm going to get revenge. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2550.0s)]
*  If I'm Kobe, I'm going to you already embarrassed me. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2554.0s)]
*  I'm going to go to the cage. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2556.0s)]
*  I will hire somebody on the street to jump mad. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2557.0s)]
*  But I do the same thing. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2559.0s)]
*  So but when you're getting to that level, it's like it's three guys. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2560.0s)]
*  Like, I'm not a guy that's going to go to court or snitch or do anything like that. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2564.0s)]
*  It's just I just don't like that mentality. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2567.0s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2569.0s)]
*  We'll see what happens because if he gets a million dollars out of the settlement, you're like, OK, you know, I mean, maybe not for chip tooth. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2570.0s)]
*  It might. I don't know. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2578.0s)]
*  I mean, if you really can prove brain damage, if he can prove that something really went wrong. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2580.0s)]
*  I mean, we don't know. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2585.0s)]
*  We mean, his career might be over. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2586.0s)]
*  Who fucking knows? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2587.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2588.0s)]
*  I don't know what happened to him. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2589.0s)]
*  You know, sometimes guys get hit and they're fucked up. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2590.0s)]
*  Yeah, especially if you don't see it coming. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2593.0s)]
*  And especially like we've seen it with guys that get knocked out and they've never been the same. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2595.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2599.0s)]
*  From it. Yeah. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2600.0s)]
*  And you're like, how the heck did this guy just change so much off of that? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2601.0s)]
*  And you're like, they took that much damage in a fight. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2604.0s)]
*  You don't know which fight is going to be. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2606.0s)]
*  And that's why I tell guys, don't spy hard because you don't want to lose those years, lose those that toughness from your chin. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2608.0s)]
*  Because you can't you can't gain muscles on your chin. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2614.0s)]
*  Right. And I think Tony Ferguson was a big one of that. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2617.0s)]
*  Like after that Gagey fight, he was never the same. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2619.0s)]
*  And it's like a prime example of like, bro, people get hurt and something changes in their their body or mind or something. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2622.0s)]
*  That was a beating, man. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2629.0s)]
*  That was a beating, that Gagey fight. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2630.0s)]
*  That was a beating. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2633.0s)]
*  And Tony caught him, caught him with a big uppercut early in the fight. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2634.0s)]
*  Remember? Oh, yeah. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2637.0s)]
*  He had him rocked. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2638.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2639.0s)]
*  He just decided to stand and Gagey instead of loading up, he started Trevor Whitman in the corner, told them like, settle down. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2640.0s)]
*  Don't fucking try to take his head off with every shot. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2649.0s)]
*  Pick your shots. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2651.0s)]
*  Be technical. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2652.0s)]
*  And then he started tuning them up. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2653.0s)]
*  And when he started tuning them up at the end of it, it was like it was bad. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2655.0s)]
*  And when I believe it was Herb Dean, when Herb Dean stopped, I was like, oh, good stoppage, because this is not this is ugly. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2659.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2665.0s)]
*  I mean, he was like moving away funny. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2666.0s)]
*  It's like he's he got too many shots. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2668.0s)]
*  Some guys are just too tough for their own good. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2670.0s)]
*  That's Tony. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2672.0s)]
*  He's so tough. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2673.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2674.0s)]
*  That motherfucker is so tough. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2675.0s)]
*  But you think back to those like how you said, he almost dropped him at the end there first. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2676.0s)]
*  Looking back at Pereira and Atasanya, where he almost dropped him at the beginning of the first. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2680.0s)]
*  You're like, how many of those fights are there where it's like one more second. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2684.0s)]
*  This guy would have won and the whole thing would have changed. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2687.0s)]
*  Yeah. If Izzy caught him with that punch two minutes to go instead of two seconds to go, who fucking knows, man? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2689.0s)]
*  He couldn't have stopped him in the first round. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2695.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2697.0s)]
*  That was right. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2698.0s)]
*  And it changes everything in the whole division. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2699.0s)]
*  You know, Izzy almost stopped him in the second kickboxing fight they had to. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2701.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2704.0s)]
*  Or, yeah, the second kickboxing fight, because then the second kickboxing fight, the first one, I thought Izzy should have won a decision. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2705.0s)]
*  It was very close, but I thought Izzy should have won. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2711.0s)]
*  And the second one, Izzy had him rocked like he had him wobbling. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2713.0s)]
*  And then they came in and gave him a standing eight count. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2718.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2720.0s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2721.0s)]
*  And I felt like he should have let him drop first before giving him the standing eight count. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2722.0s)]
*  Standing eight counts are weird. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2726.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2727.0s)]
*  They're so weird. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2728.0s)]
*  It's like you're in trouble, I'm going to give you a break versus you're in trouble and then the guy stops you. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2729.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2733.0s)]
*  Why? I don't agree with standing eight counts. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2734.0s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2736.0s)]
*  But it's like I think MMA rules are superior in that there's no, like you get dropped and you come back up. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2737.0s)]
*  Because of the fact that there's ground fighting and ground and pound, when someone gets hurt and someone can put that person away, that's the end of the fight. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2748.0s)]
*  There's a thing that happens in boxing when a guy gets dropped where you're like, one, two, and you get up and then no one's hitting you. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2755.0s)]
*  And they brush your gloves off and they go, come to me. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2762.0s)]
*  And there's all this time and you have time to sort of get your equilibrium back and move around. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2765.0s)]
*  That's probably worse for you. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2770.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2771.0s)]
*  It's probably worse for you. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2772.0s)]
*  Unless you're Tyson Fury and you get dropped by Wilder and you get up and you're like, how the heck did he come up so hard? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2773.0s)]
*  Came up and won the remainder of the round. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2778.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2781.0s)]
*  But you're looking at that too. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2782.0s)]
*  And you ever seen those videos of like the guy, the ref counting and somebody's like, dude, it was like 20 seconds, the ref's counting. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2783.0s)]
*  Because he goes one, two, and it's like, what if it's like a bad ref who's like counting a lot faster? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2788.0s)]
*  That does happen. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2793.0s)]
*  It changes everything too. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2794.0s)]
*  That happened with Mike Tyson and Buster Douglas. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2795.0s)]
*  When Tyson dropped Douglas, that was more than a 10 count. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2797.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2800.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2801.0s)]
*  And if you go back, there's people that have taken that video and superimposed it with a camera that shows you an actual count of 10. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2802.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2808.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it goes to like 11 or 12 before Buster Douglas actually gets up. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2809.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2812.0s)]
*  Let's just, when you got someone going like this, one, two, like you should have a fucking clock. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2813.0s)]
*  Like if this is 10 seconds, there should be a giant digital clock. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2821.0s)]
*  And the moment someone gets dropped, that clock goes and has nothing to do with the referee. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2825.0s)]
*  The referee should be reading that shit off the clock. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2829.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2831.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why they don't do that. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2832.0s)]
*  Like just point to it. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2833.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2834.0s)]
*  He's down. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2835.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2836.0s)]
*  Look at the clock. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2837.0s)]
*  You got seven, eight. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2838.0s)]
*  Like it's on the clock. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2839.0s)]
*  It does. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2840.0s)]
*  Because guys can do a slow count and they can do a quick count too. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2841.0s)]
*  Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2844.0s)]
*  You're like, hey, hey, hey, that's not 10. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2847.0s)]
*  That was seven. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2849.0s)]
*  That was seven seconds, bitch. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2850.0s)]
*  And then when you're looking at it too, like you said, when it comes to famous guys or like if Patty Pimla was boxing and the ref liked him more, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2852.0s)]
*  I'm not going to count faster for you. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2858.0s)]
*  Like, we're all humans, right? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2860.0s)]
*  Like we all like somebody more than another person, regardless of what you say. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2861.0s)]
*  Did you see the video of Dana and I think it was Hunter Campbell. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2865.0s)]
*  I'm not sure who it was celebrating when Patty got the win. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2869.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2873.0s)]
*  They're like, fuck yeah. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2874.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, no, no, you can't do that. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2875.0s)]
*  For me, I hate like losing in general. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2879.0s)]
*  And it hurts me more when I'm like, Jerry's like my best friend. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2881.0s)]
*  He's like my boy. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2884.0s)]
*  So seeing him lose. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2885.0s)]
*  And because I know how hard he works. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2886.0s)]
*  He's one of those guys where I know that he puts the real time and he puts the world work in his like life story. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2887.0s)]
*  So crazy is crazy. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2893.0s)]
*  So it was like that was his moment. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2894.0s)]
*  That was his moment to shine. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2896.0s)]
*  You know, the whole crowd's booing him before the fight. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2897.0s)]
*  And they're all like that could have turned into a star. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2899.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2901.0s)]
*  And I'm like, that could have changed everything. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2902.0s)]
*  So for it to be like snatched out of his hand because three stupid judges like piss you off so much. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2903.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, most people did not agree with that decision. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2909.0s)]
*  There's there's controversial decisions. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2912.0s)]
*  Like I went back and rewatched Yon Blahovitch on Koli. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2914.0s)]
*  That's a very interesting decision because like the first round you go, who won that fight? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2918.0s)]
*  Who won that round? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2924.0s)]
*  Because the first round on Koli was pushing the pace. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2925.0s)]
*  But Yon Blahovitch landed some very good leg kicks, you know, and that motherfucker goes shin to shin with people. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2928.0s)]
*  I'm looking at like I want to see how he's walking afterward because I'd walk fine. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2934.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like, what does he have? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2939.0s)]
*  He's made out of metal, dude. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2942.0s)]
*  Yon Blahovitch is made out of metal. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2944.0s)]
*  But it makes sense if you think about the power that dude carries. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2946.0s)]
*  You must have some dense ass bones. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2949.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm like, you never like Ankle Isle. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2951.0s)]
*  I've seen him training before and this dude's a monster everywhere. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2954.0s)]
*  And then you're like, wait, so his weaknesses, his lower shin. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2957.0s)]
*  All right, so we have the weakness now. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2960.0s)]
*  Other guys are looking at it like I'm not going to do that, though. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2961.0s)]
*  I'm not going to come out there low kick at his lower shin because I just think Blahovitch has like ultimate confidence [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2963.0s)]
*  in his ability to if guys want to get in a firefight with him, his ultimate confidence. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2970.0s)]
*  He could blast them out. Yeah. You know, I think he just has ultimate confidence in his durability, too. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2976.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's tough. He's kind of like a glover. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2981.0s)]
*  Both of them just have that like crazy, just like old power and old toughness. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2983.0s)]
*  And they just have the discipline of just keeping their hands up. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2988.0s)]
*  A lot of not that new fancy footwork or moving back or matrix style stuff. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2990.0s)]
*  Like they just keep it simple. Keep your hands up. Go underneath. Shuck it off. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2995.0s)]
*  Yeah, Glover, man. Forty two years old fighting for the title again. Again. Amazing. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=2998.0s)]
*  What do you think of that fight this weekend? I'm excited for it. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3006.0s)]
*  Glover is one of those guys where I felt like I felt bad for him because I thought it was going to be one of his last fights for them to take the title fight away from him. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3009.0s)]
*  Like, ah, and then like every time I see him in the P.I., he's like the nicest guy. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3016.0s)]
*  And I saw him there that weekend for the ankle eye of fight. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3019.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, man, that sucks, man. It should be you in there. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3023.0s)]
*  And he's like, sorry, man. Nice guys like us, man. It'll come back to us later, man. It takes us to long road because we're both nice guys. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3025.0s)]
*  That's interesting. Yeah. He was like the nicest guy in the world. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3032.0s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, you know what? You're right. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3034.0s)]
*  And he just made you feel good. They're like, I feel bad for you. But like, he's like, no, I'll accept it. It's OK. It'll come back to me. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3037.0s)]
*  So the way it just happened. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3043.0s)]
*  What's interesting is he he said he would fight on alive, but he said he wanted to fight him in Brazil. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3045.0s)]
*  He said, I have to adjust my game because I'm fighting a different guy now. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3050.0s)]
*  Give me some more time to like train for this guy, especially at 42 years old and especially coming off of being a champion. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3053.0s)]
*  He's supposed to be fighting Yuri Prohazka, who's this like bizarre style. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3061.0s)]
*  Yuri just moves around funny, throwing crazy shots. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3066.0s)]
*  He's got a very odd style, very specific. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3070.0s)]
*  So to go from that to Anko Lyev and Anko Lyev is like standing tall and he moves really good and he's he's very fast and super technical, totally different style. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3073.0s)]
*  Well, you got to prepare for different looks. Yeah. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3083.0s)]
*  But I mean, I understand the UFC's take on it. Like you need a title fight for the pay per view. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3086.0s)]
*  You got to sell it for that one that they had to at 42. Like you got to make your choices count. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3090.0s)]
*  Yeah. You got to make it. I like what Glover did. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3095.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. He was right. Yeah. To help him. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3097.0s)]
*  It worked out perfectly for him. Jamal's a dog though. Jamal's a dog. Jamal's a dog. Jamal's got crazy power, man. He's got crazy power. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3099.0s)]
*  Yeah, he got that. There it is. Jamal, he has an intelligence, like a fine chin intelligence. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3107.0s)]
*  He finds your chin. He like sorts through all the shit you're doing. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3113.0s)]
*  He's like, now's my time and just drops bombs. And he's so calm in there. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3118.0s)]
*  Even on the way that we when I fought Dave Amaya, he was in the car with me on the way to the fight because he fought Paul Craig that day. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3124.0s)]
*  Interesting. He's the favorite. Oh, Jamal is? Yeah. Interesting. That's interesting. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3130.0s)]
*  I guess it's just the power. Glover's age is the power. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3135.0s)]
*  And you know, it's like when you see him the way he knocked out Johnny Walker, you're like, dude, kind of glancing off the forehead. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3139.0s)]
*  Good shot, but wasn't even like his best shot. And Johnny Walker goes stiff. Jamal's got crazy power. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3145.0s)]
*  And he like switched stances right before he knocked him out with that shot. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3153.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, a bigger guy that knows how to switch stances. So smooth. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3156.0s)]
*  He's very clever in there. And that power is undeniable, man. His power is undeniable. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3160.0s)]
*  Davison Figueiredo, he made me eat my words. That motherfucker got down to flyweight. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3166.0s)]
*  I was like, last time I saw him, he was 300 pounds. I was like, dude, you're never going to be a flyweight again. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3170.0s)]
*  He came in the octagon. I'm like, you're heavier than me. Like, how are you going to get down to 125? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3176.0s)]
*  But he did, man. He looks go to his Instagram. He posted a photo today. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3181.0s)]
*  Damn, he looks good. So Davison, sir, made me eat my words. I was like, whenever you got a couple more days, Friday, we'll see. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3186.0s)]
*  He made it. I think he made it. I was saying he's probably going to go up to Bantamweight. But no, look at him. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3193.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. Damn, son. That dude shredded. Look at him. Look at him. You can't get more shredded than that. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3199.0s)]
*  That's not possible. It is literally like he's got veins everywhere in his body. You can't get more shredded than that, dude. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3207.0s)]
*  That's fucking shredded. That's their fourth fight, right? That's nuts. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3214.0s)]
*  I saw the stat today. It was like this Davison Figueredo hasn't fought anybody not named Brandon Moreno in the last four years. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3221.0s)]
*  He fought him in the last four years. It's only been Brandon Moreno. That's the only person Figueredo has fought. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3229.0s)]
*  The last guy he stopped. Yeah. Well, he fought Alex Perez. Yeah. And that was 2020. Yeah. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3234.0s)]
*  And then before that, he fought Benavides. He stopped Benavides twice. He beat him twice. And then Brandon Moreno. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3244.0s)]
*  And then the rematch, the last one, I thought Moreno won, man. Yeah. I was shocked at that decision. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3251.0s)]
*  But I was real happy that Moreno got that fight with Kai Carafranz, got the interim title, and now they're fighting for Undisputed. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3258.0s)]
*  I like that fight. I like that fight a lot. Those two guys match up really well. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3265.0s)]
*  This is going to be, I mean, we could watch them fight five or six times. I think he's going to keep switching back and forth. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3269.0s)]
*  But now Moreno doesn't have his coach with him. He switched. Right. Cross. And I'm wondering how that's going to play a factor into it. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3274.0s)]
*  What is your take on that whole thing? I don't know enough about what happened. Do you know enough about what happened? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3280.0s)]
*  I don't know enough. But it's doesn't sound good. When I watch that fight, when I look at that fight, I'm like, this guy said he had an injury. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3285.0s)]
*  Then he just felt that literally just fell down. Like it looked like he threw the fight. The one who was cornering that day. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3291.0s)]
*  And then he came out afterward and said, oh, you know, I had an injury. But it was like, at least act a little bit more if you're going to go in there and throw a fight. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3297.0s)]
*  Well, if you have an injury and you go and fight, it says UFC's Jeff Molina suspended for alleged substantial involvement in ongoing James Krause investigation. Substantial. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3304.0s)]
*  Yeah. He was on. I've heard a thing that he was on his Discord. And he said that like Jeff Molina said that like, you know, I paid my mortgage, my house, my phone bill, everything with this Discord right here. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3314.0s)]
*  Make sure you guys join it. So he was pushing it hard. So I'm sure he was under Krause. So his Discord, was that something that they were using for gambling? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3326.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think somebody or somebody that they had. You know, you're aware of this, right? What do you know? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3336.0s)]
*  What I heard, this is what I heard. There was up to 2000 people using that Discord for gambling information. And most of it was probably MMA stuff. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3341.0s)]
*  Probably all sorts of sports are being talked about. But one fight in particular, the line changed right before the fight from like, I think the favorite was like maybe minus 220 or something like that to then like negative 450, which is a four to one favorite. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3350.0s)]
*  And more specifically, it was like of a KO in the first round and it happened in like 48 seconds. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3364.0s)]
*  Oh, or something too, is what I was hearing. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3370.0s)]
*  So people knew that there was an injury and they were letting people know that there was an injury so that affected the gambling line. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3374.0s)]
*  And then they traced that shit back to find out. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3381.0s)]
*  Oh, they fucked everybody because now you can't bet on yourself. Like if you want, if you fought Hamza and you're like, fuck, I'm putting 100 grand on myself. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3382.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3388.0s)]
*  That's, that's cool. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3389.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of fighters that do that. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3390.0s)]
*  You should be able to gamble on yourself. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3392.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, if you're going to gamble. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3394.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3395.0s)]
*  But now I don't think fighters are able to gamble even on like football or basketball or anything. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3396.0s)]
*  Like DraftKens or something. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3400.0s)]
*  We haven't tweeted out. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3402.0s)]
*  That's terrible. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3403.0s)]
*  That's terrible. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3405.0s)]
*  You guys fucked us. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3406.0s)]
*  Freaking Krauss, man. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3407.0s)]
*  I was, he was on Eri Hwani before and he said he makes more money gambling than he did fighting. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3408.0s)]
*  And I think that like triggered everybody. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3414.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. Let me check what you do. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3416.0s)]
*  And I met a couple of guys in Vegas and they were like talking about the situation. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3418.0s)]
*  And he was telling me like one guy was like, oh yeah, you know, I make like $500,000 each UFC fight. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3423.0s)]
*  And I'm like, really? He's like, yeah. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3429.0s)]
*  What? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3430.0s)]
*  He's like, there's fights that are the lines still out there even after the fights done. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3431.0s)]
*  So the fight will happen. He knows who won and how they won. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3435.0s)]
*  And then some of the casinos will still have the lineup. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3438.0s)]
*  What? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3440.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he's like, I'm going to bet the house on it. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3441.0s)]
*  And I'm like, you're lying. He's like, bro, I'll show you my bank account. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3443.0s)]
*  Like this is what I do. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3446.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3447.0s)]
*  He's gambling after the fight is concluded? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3448.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3451.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3452.0s)]
*  That's what I was like, that can't be true. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3453.0s)]
*  He's like, bro, there's casinos. I'll look for the casino that has it. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3454.0s)]
*  He said, all I do is gamble. That's what I do. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3456.0s)]
*  And I'll wait for the fight to be finished and they'll still have the lineup. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3458.0s)]
*  And I'll go into the casino, put the bet on there. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3461.0s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3464.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3465.0s)]
*  That seems like the casino should be able to get their money back. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3466.0s)]
*  Like it's already concluded. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3468.0s)]
*  I don't know if I'm snitching on them or not, but yeah, that's crazy. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3470.0s)]
*  I think you might be snitching. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3472.0s)]
*  No names were said, right? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3474.0s)]
*  I didn't hear any names. I heard no names. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3475.0s)]
*  Yeah. But I feel like you should be able to gamble. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3478.0s)]
*  You definitely should be able to gamble on your fighter. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3481.0s)]
*  You definitely should be able to gamble on yourself. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3483.0s)]
*  As long as you're not gambling for someone to lose. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3485.0s)]
*  And if there's a situation like this where it shows that someone is either taking a dive [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3488.0s)]
*  or the coach lets everybody know, hey, this guy's injured, you know, bet on the other dude. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3492.0s)]
*  That kind of shit you really should be banned for. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3497.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3500.0s)]
*  You shouldn't. I mean, I don't know what Krauss actually did [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3501.0s)]
*  and what actually is going to happen to him, but that makes me upset. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3503.0s)]
*  That's terrible shit. That's terrible. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3507.0s)]
*  Especially, you ruined it for all these guys that like, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3510.0s)]
*  if you wanted to fight Hamza and you wanted to bet a hundred grand on yourself [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3513.0s)]
*  or you wanted to bet on yourself against Kolbe, you should be able to do that. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3517.0s)]
*  That's a fun storyline. I want to talk about that. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3520.0s)]
*  Exactly. You have confidence in yourself that much. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3523.0s)]
*  And doing commentary, I want to be able to bring it up. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3525.0s)]
*  This is how much he believes in himself. He put a hundred grand on himself. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3527.0s)]
*  Yeah, but now you can't even do that. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3531.0s)]
*  Check this out. The company that found this is called US Integrity. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3533.0s)]
*  They found it. I think this would be the PFL event. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3538.0s)]
*  It says they showed fights that were taped a month ahead of time [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3541.0s)]
*  and aired them as though they were live. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3545.0s)]
*  No! [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3547.0s)]
*  And people gambled on them? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3548.0s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3550.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that's so stupid. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3551.0s)]
*  This was one of the ones that he was telling me about too. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3554.0s)]
*  He said that Krauss put out his Discord that they knew all the results from this fight. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3556.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3561.0s)]
*  That is so dumb. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3562.0s)]
*  Yeah, they had all the results. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3564.0s)]
*  That's so pushy. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3565.0s)]
*  I made like 200,000, but I know guys that made like 800,000 off of that. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3566.0s)]
*  Oh my God, you're going to jail, bitch. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3569.0s)]
*  It was a professional fighter to leave challenge series. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3571.0s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3573.0s)]
*  It is like... [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3574.0s)]
*  That's so dumb. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3575.0s)]
*  They didn't play the results, but people that were in the crowd, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3577.0s)]
*  they were like, we were going to Texas, like, hey, I was in the crowd, I know who won one. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3579.0s)]
*  You won all these things. You get 50 grand. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3582.0s)]
*  And I was like... [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3584.0s)]
*  That's insane. I can't believe that's real. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3585.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was crazy. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3588.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that's so unsophisticated. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3589.0s)]
*  How the fuck did they not know that the fights already took place [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3591.0s)]
*  when they have a line on it? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3594.0s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3596.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, I think that's another issue too with like the UFCPI, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3598.0s)]
*  where you see guys fight week, random guys are walking in, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3602.0s)]
*  and if they see somebody getting worked on who's fighting, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3606.0s)]
*  and they see, oh, he's getting his ankle worked on. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3608.0s)]
*  So you're like, go back. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3610.0s)]
*  Oh, I think something's wrong with his ankle or something's wrong with... [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3611.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'd heard about T.J. Dillshaw's shoulder before that fight. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3613.0s)]
*  Oh, did you? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3616.0s)]
*  Yeah, before he fought Al Jermain. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3617.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'd heard about his shoulder. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3619.0s)]
*  I knew his shoulder was fucked already [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3621.0s)]
*  because I knew that he had been getting stem cells. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3623.0s)]
*  He had gone down to Dr. Neil Reardon, who's a stem cell guy. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3625.0s)]
*  He has a clinic down in Panama, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3630.0s)]
*  and he was going down to Panama to get shoulder stem cells. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3633.0s)]
*  During camp? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3636.0s)]
*  Yeah, this was quite a while ago though. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3637.0s)]
*  This was before he got popped for EPO, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3639.0s)]
*  before he fought Henry, Henry Cejudo. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3641.0s)]
*  And so he has like some pretty substantial tears to his shoulders. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3645.0s)]
*  His shoulders are pretty fucked. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3650.0s)]
*  I think his supraspinatus is completely torn off on both shoulders. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3652.0s)]
*  It's not good. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3657.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3658.0s)]
*  And stem cells could fix that? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3659.0s)]
*  Not really. No. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3660.0s)]
*  I don't even know if anything could fix it at this point [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3662.0s)]
*  because it's like when you... [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3664.0s)]
*  If you have something that's torn off, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3666.0s)]
*  and I'm completely speaking out of line here. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3668.0s)]
*  I don't know the actual full extent of his injuries. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3670.0s)]
*  I'm not a doctor. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3673.0s)]
*  I haven't even seen his MRIs. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3674.0s)]
*  But what he was explaining to me is that he tore it early in his career [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3676.0s)]
*  and that he had just been using bands and all these things [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3680.0s)]
*  to keep all the other muscles strong and keep the stabilizers strong. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3683.0s)]
*  But eventually that shit just gives out. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3686.0s)]
*  And then it just popped out of socket during the fight. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3688.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was... [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3691.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3692.0s)]
*  Anyway, we've seen a couple of shoulder injuries now. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3693.0s)]
*  It's like crazy how it happens to one person and it starts happening. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3695.0s)]
*  Aaron Pico had his shoulder popped out. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3698.0s)]
*  Brian Ortega. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3700.0s)]
*  With Yuri Prochaska. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3701.0s)]
*  Oh, Prochaska. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3702.0s)]
*  Yuri Prochaska's shoulder popped out and his guy tried to put it back in [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3703.0s)]
*  and tore his shit. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3707.0s)]
*  Oh, no way. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3708.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were trying to manipulate it and put it back in. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3709.0s)]
*  It fucked it up even worse. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3712.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3714.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3715.0s)]
*  Get a bunch of guys yanking on your shoulder. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3716.0s)]
*  Oh, we got it. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3718.0s)]
*  We got this. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3719.0s)]
*  We got this, buddy. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3720.0s)]
*  Fucking... [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3721.0s)]
*  That's the fighter mentality. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3722.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's all right. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3723.0s)]
*  Rub some dirt in it. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3724.0s)]
*  I won't go to that doctor or hospital unless I'm unconscious [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3725.0s)]
*  or I really, really need it. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3728.0s)]
*  I'm trying to avoid that at all costs. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3730.0s)]
*  Just seeing a doctor. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3732.0s)]
*  I don't care what's going on with me. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3733.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm afraid. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3735.0s)]
*  If there's any chance you're going to tell me I can't fight [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3736.0s)]
*  or don't train anymore, I'm going to be like, no, F you. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3739.0s)]
*  It's all right. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3742.0s)]
*  What's your worst injury you've ever had so far? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3743.0s)]
*  For me, honestly, I've had two detached retinas. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3745.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3749.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3750.0s)]
*  Was one of them for the Leon fight? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3751.0s)]
*  No, I had one before that fight. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3753.0s)]
*  It was, I think it was after... [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3755.0s)]
*  It was from training. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3758.0s)]
*  I was training one day and I'm sparring [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3760.0s)]
*  and then all of a sudden I see black at the top of my eye [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3763.0s)]
*  and I'm like, rub it, whatever. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3766.0s)]
*  So I go back to sparring, light sparring, removing, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3769.0s)]
*  and rippling and then it just becomes literally all black. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3771.0s)]
*  You can see it, but it's like a film of black over your eye. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3775.0s)]
*  I'm like, what the fudge is going on? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3778.0s)]
*  Then I'm like, all right, well, let me go to the doctor. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3780.0s)]
*  Then the doctor just gives me a look and I'm like, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3783.0s)]
*  yeah, we got to go to surgery immediately. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3787.0s)]
*  I'm like, what do you mean? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3790.0s)]
*  What's going on? What's wrong? Blah, blah, blah. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3792.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, you have a detached retina. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3794.0s)]
*  You can go blind. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3797.0s)]
*  You're thinking of Michael Bisbing and what happened to him? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3799.0s)]
*  You don't know what to do. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3802.0s)]
*  So then we go to the... [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3804.0s)]
*  I had to go to the surgery right away because the longer you wait, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3806.0s)]
*  you're going to lose vision more and more. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3809.0s)]
*  So they had to put a bubble in my eye. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3812.0s)]
*  I still didn't know what it was. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3815.0s)]
*  I'm assuming once he takes the band-aids off, I'm going to be able to see. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3818.0s)]
*  So he takes the... [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3821.0s)]
*  I go in there, get the surgery done, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3823.0s)]
*  and then the next Monday I go in there and takes the band-aids off. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3825.0s)]
*  I'm like, bro, I still can't see. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3828.0s)]
*  He's like, no, it's going to be... [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3830.0s)]
*  We have to see what it's going to be like in eight to 12 weeks. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3832.0s)]
*  You're going to have a bubble in your eye. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3836.0s)]
*  And you have to hold your head on a tilt like this. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3838.0s)]
*  For 12 weeks? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3843.0s)]
*  So you have to tilt your head sideways for 12 weeks? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3845.0s)]
*  Yeah, you have to keep the bubble in its place. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3847.0s)]
*  So it lines up the retina or seals it back in. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3849.0s)]
*  And then I couldn't watch... [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3853.0s)]
*  You know the massage tables where you have to put your head down? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3856.0s)]
*  I had to sit on one of those to watch TV with a mirror that was downward, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3859.0s)]
*  and it was pointing up to the TV because I couldn't look up like this. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3863.0s)]
*  I had to keep my head down so the pressure's on there. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3866.0s)]
*  So I had to watch TV like this. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3869.0s)]
*  You had to watch TV through a hole in the massage table? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3871.0s)]
*  Dude, honestly, it was the most depressing thing that I've ever gone through in my life. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3873.0s)]
*  It was the hardest thing. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3877.0s)]
*  It was one of those things too where I'm not one of those guys that cries wolf or anything. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3879.0s)]
*  So I kept it to myself. I didn't even tell my parents or my family. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3883.0s)]
*  I would just go to the house with sunglasses on and see them, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3886.0s)]
*  and then just avoid seeing them, type thing like that. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3889.0s)]
*  So they didn't even know you had a touch right now? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3892.0s)]
*  No. Well, now they know now from here. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3894.0s)]
*  But yeah, it was rough because you can't do any working out. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3897.0s)]
*  I'm a guy that works out constantly, two to three times a day. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3901.0s)]
*  So for 12 weeks you couldn't do shit? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3905.0s)]
*  12 weeks couldn't do nothing. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3906.0s)]
*  Could you even go walk around the block? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3907.0s)]
*  I could go walk, but not a lot. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3909.0s)]
*  Yeah, not a lot. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3912.0s)]
*  And for the first four weeks, I had to stay in this specific position the whole time. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3914.0s)]
*  And then you had to sleep with your head down. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3921.0s)]
*  I'm a back sleeper too, so I had to sleep with my head down on a massage table too. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3923.0s)]
*  I had to stay in that position the whole time. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3928.0s)]
*  12 weeks period goings, and the bubble starts shrinking and shrinking and shrinking. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3932.0s)]
*  So you're always seeing a little bubble in your eye. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3936.0s)]
*  And then finally, by the 12 weeks, it was done. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3938.0s)]
*  But then he was just like, yeah, I wouldn't fight anymore. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3940.0s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3943.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then you're like, no, I'm going to fight. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3944.0s)]
*  I don't care what you say, type thing. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3946.0s)]
*  And so then I go back to regular training, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3948.0s)]
*  and I start wearing one of those catcher's face masks to spar and train. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3950.0s)]
*  And I'm wearing goggles to train and roll in. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3954.0s)]
*  And I just don't know how it's going to react once I go back to sparring and hitting hard again. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3957.0s)]
*  How long did it take before you felt confident? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3961.0s)]
*  Confident? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3964.0s)]
*  The 12 week period was when the bubble was gone. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3965.0s)]
*  And then probably like eight weeks into it. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3968.0s)]
*  After that, where I was trying to get back into shape, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3972.0s)]
*  getting back to the thing and finally trying to go hard sparring without the goggles on. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3975.0s)]
*  Yeah, so it was rough. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3979.0s)]
*  Do you remember what you got hit with? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3981.0s)]
*  No, that was the thing. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3983.0s)]
*  I don't remember what specific thing happened to it. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3984.0s)]
*  So it didn't make any sense. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3987.0s)]
*  It didn't make any sense. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3989.0s)]
*  But you get poked in the eye sometime during training or anything, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3990.0s)]
*  but you just don't think nothing of it. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3993.0s)]
*  So you don't really go to your check. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3995.0s)]
*  But I never wondered. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3997.0s)]
*  So then it was just constant wearing tear on it. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=3999.0s)]
*  So after you got the surgery done, was there a point in time where you're like, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4003.0s)]
*  hey, I don't know if my career is going to be over here? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4008.0s)]
*  That point was during the Leon fight when he poked it. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4012.0s)]
*  And I couldn't see nothing. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4017.0s)]
*  And I was like, this is what the doctor said. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4019.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm blind. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4022.0s)]
*  And I was like, and then you're like, you waited this long to get a main event. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4024.0s)]
*  You waited this moment and it just got taken away from you. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4028.0s)]
*  And you're like, I'm done fighting. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4031.0s)]
*  And it was just like, even worse, maybe you can't see. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4034.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, in that moment, you're just thinking like, dang. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4038.0s)]
*  Because fighting is my life for me. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4042.0s)]
*  This is what I want. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4045.0s)]
*  My goal is to be right here at the top to be a champion. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4046.0s)]
*  So just get it taken away from me. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4049.0s)]
*  I was like, not seeing a second nature. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4051.0s)]
*  I'm like, man, I can't train. I can't fight. I can't do this. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4053.0s)]
*  So that was the most heartbreaking thing. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4055.0s)]
*  And knowing that, probably have to go through it again. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4057.0s)]
*  Not knowing what type of surgery it is. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4059.0s)]
*  The doctor told me not to do it. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4060.0s)]
*  You should have stopped. What's wrong with you? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4061.0s)]
*  And you're like, fudge it. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4063.0s)]
*  How long did it take? I like how you won't even say fuck. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4065.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4068.0s)]
*  How long did it take before your vision came back after that poke? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4071.0s)]
*  And the Leon fight, it was like 40 minutes after that. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4075.0s)]
*  Then I realized that my eye would just like, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4079.0s)]
*  I had to get like three stitches under the bottom eyelid. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4082.0s)]
*  And that's when I realized that my eye was just closed. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4085.0s)]
*  It wasn't blind. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4089.0s)]
*  Because I didn't realize my eye was closed. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4091.0s)]
*  I was like, bro, I'm blind. I'm like done. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4093.0s)]
*  But then they're like, the guy's like trying to open like this. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4095.0s)]
*  And he's like, you see any light? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4098.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I see light. I see light. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4099.0s)]
*  And then, yeah, so then probably when I got back to the hospital, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4101.0s)]
*  they had to do like stitches in the bottom eyelid. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4105.0s)]
*  And he was like, don't blink. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4109.0s)]
*  And I'm like, having a stitcher with my eye getting stitched. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4112.0s)]
*  Don't blink. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4115.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I was like, fuck the fudge. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4116.0s)]
*  And I was like, it was like the worst thing ever. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4118.0s)]
*  So then thankfully, I was just like, it wasn't detached right now again. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4120.0s)]
*  I was like, I felt blessed. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4125.0s)]
*  But you have two detached right now? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4127.0s)]
*  And it had in the other eye as well. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4129.0s)]
*  When did that one happen? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4131.0s)]
*  It was after that one. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4132.0s)]
*  Really? After the Leon fight? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4133.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4136.0s)]
*  So after that one, it was after the Luque fight. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4137.0s)]
*  I mean, it had detached right now. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4143.0s)]
*  What do you call it? My lens was detached. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4145.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4148.0s)]
*  Yeah, so in the third round of the Luque fight, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4149.0s)]
*  he just like hit me and I was like, I'm in the corner. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4152.0s)]
*  I feel something weird in my eye. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4155.0s)]
*  It's like a shield in front of it. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4157.0s)]
*  And I was like, what the fudge? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4159.0s)]
*  I felt like I just got poked and I was trying to rub it. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4161.0s)]
*  And it's the Tate, the cut man, he's like, bro, ain't nothing in your eye. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4163.0s)]
*  Stop playing. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4167.0s)]
*  And I was like, dude, I feel like something. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4168.0s)]
*  But I'm like, I still could see a little bit out of there. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4170.0s)]
*  So I'm like, all right, well, whatever. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4172.0s)]
*  I'm just going to keep fighting. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4173.0s)]
*  So I'm like, I just got to take him down. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4174.0s)]
*  And I only had two rounds left. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4176.0s)]
*  And I thought I won the first three rounds. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4177.0s)]
*  So then I was like, all right, well, whatever, whatever. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4179.0s)]
*  And then afterward, I'm like, the doctor's like, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4181.0s)]
*  well, it doesn't look like there's anything detached or torn in there. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4184.0s)]
*  I said, OK, cool. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4187.0s)]
*  So then I wait till I get back home and they're like, your lens is it was like loose. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4188.0s)]
*  So then I had to have surgery on the lens part of my. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4195.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4198.0s)]
*  When they do that, are you awake? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4199.0s)]
*  No, no, they put me to sleep. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4200.0s)]
*  Yeah, they put me. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4202.0s)]
*  But I like, like I said, for the first detached run, I didn't know how long it was before I see. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4203.0s)]
*  But thankfully, with this one, it was just it was like full of blood afterward, but I was able to see. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4207.0s)]
*  So I was like, did you see that new guy from Dagestan that got signed by the UFC in the Middle [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4212.0s)]
*  Eight division to blind? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4217.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's that's crazy. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4218.0s)]
*  I was like, I didn't know you could fight. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4220.0s)]
*  I think Bissping had a lie all these years about being blind in what I. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4222.0s)]
*  But this dude, see if you could find that guy. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4227.0s)]
*  He's a fucking killer to man. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4229.0s)]
*  Nasty striker. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4231.0s)]
*  Yeah, I met him in Dubai and he came and took a picture with me and he was like, I'm undefeated fighter. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4232.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, man, look at him. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4238.0s)]
*  He's got one eye. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4240.0s)]
*  Sharaputin Magomedov. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4242.0s)]
*  Nasty striker, too. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4245.0s)]
*  But he's got one eye, which is really crazy, man. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4247.0s)]
*  Fighting on a Moscow Russia, 28 year old forced to undergo eye surgery before making a return to the cage in 2021. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4251.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4258.0s)]
*  It's crazy because I didn't think that that was legal. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4261.0s)]
*  Yeah, I thought if you maybe there is only legal in certain states, maybe only a stuff like that. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4265.0s)]
*  I don't know what the what the laws are. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4269.0s)]
*  Yeah, I thought like Bissping said he had a lie. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4271.0s)]
*  He had to memorize the charts. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4273.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know you have to get eye test every single time beforehand. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4275.0s)]
*  And they check it all like that way. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4278.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I was I was sitting to read the Bissping book and it's speaking like, man, am I ever going to have to do that? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4280.0s)]
*  We're figuring out a way to lie and everything. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4285.0s)]
*  And just like reading his book and listening to his book, it was crazy because like the way he described it. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4288.0s)]
*  And when I had to detach right now, you're like, you're going to like the retinal doctor. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4293.0s)]
*  And it's like nothing but old people in there. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4297.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's like, I don't belong in here with these like older people. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4299.0s)]
*  Why? Why am I having to get this stuff? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4302.0s)]
*  And all the nurses are like, what happened to you? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4304.0s)]
*  Like, you shouldn't be in here. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4306.0s)]
*  This is for people like cataracts and stuff like that. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4308.0s)]
*  You don't get later in life. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4310.0s)]
*  So Bissping is a fucking gangster. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4312.0s)]
*  I mean, he fought like 11 fights like that. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4315.0s)]
*  11 fights with one eye won the title with one eye. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4317.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4319.0s)]
*  He's one of the guys that like I like try to mimic a lot because he was good every time. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4321.0s)]
*  He was good everywhere. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4326.0s)]
*  He was one of those guys and people used to call him pillow hands and all the other stuff. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4327.0s)]
*  But he would freaking light guys up in there. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4331.0s)]
*  His cardio was his weapon and he'll break guys. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4333.0s)]
*  He won, beat Luke Rockwell by knockout. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4335.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4338.0s)]
*  I mean, and it was a beautiful punch to the way he slipped it over the shoulder. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4339.0s)]
*  He is like one of the toughest guys that's ever fought. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4343.0s)]
*  Just just mental toughness, the fortitude to fight like that with one eye. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4347.0s)]
*  It changed. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4351.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a different type of man that's willing to do that. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4353.0s)]
*  And like I said, you got to want it that much more because you said after your career, there's a life after your career. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4356.0s)]
*  How bad do you want to be a champion? [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4363.0s)]
*  34. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4365.0s)]
*  34. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4366.0s)]
*  When you think about how much time you have left in this life to have one eye and go through that all the time because of fighting. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4367.0s)]
*  And they you know, there's certain things they can do now to fix eyes. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4375.0s)]
*  But I sent bisming an article actually that I read about them bringing vision back to people that have lost eyes. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4378.0s)]
*  But he said it didn't apply to him because his nerves already dead. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4385.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. Yeah. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4388.0s)]
*  Nerd. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4389.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4390.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4391.0s)]
*  So your right eye is the one that you had the lens detached. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4392.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4395.0s)]
*  Did that when that got fixed, how long did that take? [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4396.0s)]
*  Was it the same process? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4399.0s)]
*  It wasn't. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4400.0s)]
*  It wasn't as bad as that one. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4401.0s)]
*  It was just like it was probably like four weeks after that one that I was able to I was able to see right away. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4402.0s)]
*  But it was like just full of blood. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4409.0s)]
*  So I just had to wait for the blood to clear out of the eye. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4410.0s)]
*  And yeah, after that, it was just clear. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4413.0s)]
*  And like same thing, same mindset of trying to get back into training and everything and getting over that hump. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4415.0s)]
*  I was training with goggles on still. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4420.0s)]
*  And you're still thinking about it like, all right, am I just jinxed? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4422.0s)]
*  Am I like there's something wrong with that? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4426.0s)]
*  Or is God trying to tell me something? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4428.0s)]
*  Do you think they could do a better job designing the gloves? [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4430.0s)]
*  For sure. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4433.0s)]
*  I think so. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4434.0s)]
*  And or like enforcing the rules better. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4435.0s)]
*  If you're going to tell guys like, hey, if you put your fingers like this, don't do it. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4438.0s)]
*  But they give you like 25 warnings. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4442.0s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't really make any sense. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4444.0s)]
*  One eye poke one point. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4446.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4447.0s)]
*  Right away. Right away. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4448.0s)]
*  Take a point away. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4449.0s)]
*  And I don't care how bad it is. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4450.0s)]
*  Even if it's not intentional, it's damaging. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4451.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4452.0s)]
*  I mean, it's it's you're you're you're compromising the other fighters ability to fight. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4453.0s)]
*  They can't see as good. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4457.0s)]
*  They're they're fucked up because now their eye hurts. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4459.0s)]
*  Like so they're now they have to think about something which is going to it's going to occupy their mind. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4462.0s)]
*  There's so many factors. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4467.0s)]
*  I mean, you got to be that guy to that. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4468.0s)]
*  You can't say that. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4470.0s)]
*  You got to tell them that the doctor that, oh, I'm good to fight. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4471.0s)]
*  Otherwise, you don't look tough. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4474.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4475.0s)]
*  And you could be like a DC when you fought steep and he said, I do. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4476.0s)]
*  I couldn't see the whole time. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4479.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4480.0s)]
*  And as I was like, literally full of blood, I like, bro, that was a terrible poke. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4481.0s)]
*  Eye pokes and nut shots. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4484.0s)]
*  I think I poke. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4486.0s)]
*  I think I poke even more than nut shots because with a proper cup with a really good like a diamond MMA cup or a steel tie cup, you could take a nut shot. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4487.0s)]
*  It hurts. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4495.0s)]
*  But it's not going to really compromise you the way an eye poke is going to compromise you. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4496.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4500.0s)]
*  I poke change fights, change everything, change everything. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4501.0s)]
*  And I don't care who you are or how tough you think you are. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4504.0s)]
*  Like if you can't see or your eyes shut, you're going to keep going to that side. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4506.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're fucked. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4511.0s)]
*  And it's just it can ruin careers. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4512.0s)]
*  And, you know, they have gloves that are better. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4514.0s)]
*  That's Trevor Whitman has designed a glove. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4516.0s)]
*  He's got that company called Onyx. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4519.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4521.0s)]
*  You use this stuff. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4522.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've used this box of gloves. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4523.0s)]
*  Boxes was really good. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4524.0s)]
*  Fantastic stuff. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4525.0s)]
*  But his MMA glove is so superior and it keeps you in a curved position. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4526.0s)]
*  It keeps your hand curved. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4530.0s)]
*  Whereas the UFC gloves keep your hand stretched out and you have to close it on purpose to make a fist. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4532.0s)]
*  With this glove, it's naturally like this. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4537.0s)]
*  The whole time. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4540.0s)]
*  Yeah, the whole time. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4541.0s)]
*  So you can still grapple because you can open it up and you can clamp down on stuff. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4542.0s)]
*  But but your natural inclination. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4546.0s)]
*  See if you could get a video or a photo of it. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4548.0s)]
*  His gloves are the shit. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4551.0s)]
*  And I know he was in negotiation with the UFC. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4553.0s)]
*  I forget what happened. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4556.0s)]
*  Something went wrong. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4558.0s)]
*  And I talked to the UFC and I talked to him. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4559.0s)]
*  I'm like, what is going to do that? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4561.0s)]
*  Get his gloves. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4563.0s)]
*  That's the best way to make it work. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4564.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think like the UFC. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4565.0s)]
*  I don't know what the story was. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4567.0s)]
*  There was some business deal that they could a bridge. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4568.0s)]
*  It could not be crossed. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4571.0s)]
*  I don't know what it was. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4572.0s)]
*  If I wish there's a lot of things that I wish I was in control. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4573.0s)]
*  If I was in control, that glove right there, that's his glove. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4577.0s)]
*  It's the shit. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4580.0s)]
*  It's better. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4581.0s)]
*  Keeps your fist like that. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4582.0s)]
*  You stay like that the whole time. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4583.0s)]
*  Yeah, my fist like I'm not clenching it to hold it like that. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4585.0s)]
*  It's just naturally like that. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4588.0s)]
*  They're the best gloves, man. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4590.0s)]
*  They're the best by far. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4591.0s)]
*  I love them. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4593.0s)]
*  And they're also better foam. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4595.0s)]
*  It's a superior foam. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4597.0s)]
*  Trevor's a genius. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4598.0s)]
*  Trevor really knows his shit when it comes to creating equipment. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4600.0s)]
*  And also he has a long history of combat sports. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4603.0s)]
*  But those onyx gloves, the boxing gloves, his shin pads are the best. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4606.0s)]
*  His fucking everything he has is the best. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4610.0s)]
*  Is he making those gloves by the other ones by hand? [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4613.0s)]
*  I do not know. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4615.0s)]
*  I do not know. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4616.0s)]
*  I don't know how he's doing it. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4617.0s)]
*  But the UFC ones are weird. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4618.0s)]
*  Like sometimes you'll get a pair and fight day and it's like a lot harder and a lot stiffer than normal to that. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4619.0s)]
*  Some fights you'll be like, oh, I feel way better. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4625.0s)]
*  That's his eye poke pulled up. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4627.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4630.0s)]
*  You bring a bad bad memory. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4632.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4633.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4634.0s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4636.0s)]
*  That was the Leon one. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4638.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude, that is in there. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4639.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4641.0s)]
*  Leon got his finger in your eyelid. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4642.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4644.0s)]
*  Yeah, I had to get stitches in that whole bottom part. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4645.0s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like cut it with his fingernail. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4647.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4649.0s)]
*  Well, now that he's a champ, you got to be looking at that. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4650.0s)]
*  I mean, after the Sean Brady fight, I mean, you're in the hunt, right? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4654.0s)]
*  That's what you would assume. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4658.0s)]
*  But you would assume. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4660.0s)]
*  But you get mad because guys like him are trying to push the narrative. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4661.0s)]
*  Well, I won the first round and the rest of the fight was going to go like that. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4664.0s)]
*  And it's funny because it's like how much he was getting killed by Usman and he won in the last 30 seconds. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4668.0s)]
*  So you would sit there and I'll be like, oh, let me get the Leon fight. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4673.0s)]
*  Well, he was killing you. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4676.0s)]
*  Every single person. Oh, he was killing you. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4677.0s)]
*  You're like, there's a reason why fights are five rounds or three rounds. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4678.0s)]
*  And then for a guy like me, I'm like, I took that fight on two weeks notice. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4681.0s)]
*  It was short notice, first of all. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4684.0s)]
*  Secondly, my head coach, Lou Taylor, he had covid that day. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4685.0s)]
*  So they took them out. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4688.0s)]
*  So then I had to get a new coach in the corner. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4689.0s)]
*  Shout out to coach Safezulud. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4691.0s)]
*  He was in there, but it was still the first time trying to mesh our teams together. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4693.0s)]
*  And it was all just first main event, everything. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4697.0s)]
*  So I'm like, bro, give me a full camp. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4700.0s)]
*  I'm a guy that likes to study fighters. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4702.0s)]
*  I study my opponents. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4704.0s)]
*  I'm like, for the Sean Brady fight, we were studying him so hard. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4705.0s)]
*  All right, he's going to come out. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4708.0s)]
*  His first strike is always a left inside kick. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4709.0s)]
*  And literally, that's the first thing he did. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4711.0s)]
*  Like, I'm looking at how you react to a single, like how you react to a double, like how you get on top. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4713.0s)]
*  Khabib sending me videos like he goes for a rear neck and choke with only his left hand. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4718.0s)]
*  He doesn't use his right hand for a guillotine. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4722.0s)]
*  So be careful with that. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4725.0s)]
*  It's like we're looking at the smallest details with everything. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4726.0s)]
*  You can't really do that for a one week notice fight. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4728.0s)]
*  Right. No, you can't. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4731.0s)]
*  And you also you're not going to change your conditioning and your preparation and what you do and what you don't do. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4732.0s)]
*  You don't have enough time. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4737.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good fight. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4738.0s)]
*  I'd like that fight. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4739.0s)]
*  I'd love to see that rematch. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4740.0s)]
*  I mean, he's talking about Masvidal. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4742.0s)]
*  That's what he keeps talking about. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4744.0s)]
*  But because, you know, he wants to get him back for soccer punch and backstage in London. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4746.0s)]
*  You had four years to try to get that back yourself. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4749.0s)]
*  And you didn't come. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4753.0s)]
*  So you weren't pushing it that hard. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4754.0s)]
*  I understand the money fight and it's going to sell pay per views, obviously. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4756.0s)]
*  But he's got to get past Usman. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4761.0s)]
*  You know, Usman in March. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4763.0s)]
*  What do you think about that rematch? [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4765.0s)]
*  I mean, if Usman fights that fifth round cautiously, that never happens. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4768.0s)]
*  You know, if he fights that fifth round and just, you know, circles away from him and doesn't try to close the distance and doesn't try to take him down or doesn't doesn't engage, just plays defensively, he wins that fight. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4774.0s)]
*  But, you know, what Leon did was perfect. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4788.0s)]
*  I mean, it was the perfect high kick. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4791.0s)]
*  You can't take a thing away from him. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4793.0s)]
*  The guy's down at least two rounds, three rounds, going into the fifth. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4795.0s)]
*  He's losing the fight. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4801.0s)]
*  It's for the title. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4803.0s)]
*  He shows him the left and hits him with a perfect high kick. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4804.0s)]
*  I mean, you can't take anything away from that. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4808.0s)]
*  That was that was the most consequential high kick of all time because it's from behind. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4810.0s)]
*  He's coming from behind. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4816.0s)]
*  He's fighting for the title. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4818.0s)]
*  He's fighting a guy who already beat him before. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4820.0s)]
*  He's fighting Usman, who at the time was the man of mans. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4823.0s)]
*  I mean, everybody thought he's the greatest welterweight, arguably is the greatest welterweight of all time right up there with George St. Pierre. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4828.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then boom, lands a perfect high kick. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4834.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, people so many times when people say, oh, it was a lucky kick. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4837.0s)]
*  I like I like, bro, you can't call anything lucky in the sport because you throw it to land it. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4841.0s)]
*  I'm not throwing any strike not to land it. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4847.0s)]
*  And it's just you're talking to assholes. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4849.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4851.0s)]
*  Lucky kick. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4852.0s)]
*  Fear is so funny. But do you think that he's able to do the you think it's going to come out this fight just wrestling him? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4853.0s)]
*  Who knows, man? Who knows? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4858.0s)]
*  Who knows? Usman has problems with his knees, man, like real problems with his knees. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4860.0s)]
*  And now his hand like we're seeing with a cast on every time. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4865.0s)]
*  And I'm like hitting up Ali because we both have the same manager. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4869.0s)]
*  Shout out to Ali Abdulaziz. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4871.0s)]
*  And I'm messaging him like, bro, what's this talk with Usman like if he's not fighting for the title, it needs to be me. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4873.0s)]
*  Like it can't be Mazvara. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4877.0s)]
*  And he's like, no, it's going to be Usman. It's going to be Usman. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4879.0s)]
*  I'm like, why aren't they announcing it? They announced London. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4881.0s)]
*  Like, why are they not announcing the fight? [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4883.0s)]
*  And then they finally announced it. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4885.0s)]
*  But I was on him all the time. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4887.0s)]
*  What did he get done to his hand? [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4889.0s)]
*  There's something with like the ligaments, I think, in his like thumb or something that they had to like reattach. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4891.0s)]
*  Well, he got surgery before the fight. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4896.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4898.0s)]
*  And so he got another surgery after the fight. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4899.0s)]
*  So the retare. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4901.0s)]
*  I think it was I'm not sure if it was in the fight. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4903.0s)]
*  I think it was probably a different injury. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4905.0s)]
*  See if you can find out what injury it was. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4907.0s)]
*  Man, it's just. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4909.0s)]
*  Your body can only take so much. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4911.0s)]
*  I mean, you only have so many years in this game. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4913.0s)]
*  And with Kamaru, he's always had bad knees. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4915.0s)]
*  I mean, he's got he can't run. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4917.0s)]
*  He openly talks about it. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4919.0s)]
*  He does all of his cardio on like a salt bike and does all sorts of different stuff for cardio. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4921.0s)]
*  But in terms of like road work, he said he can't even like he walks backwards downstairs. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4923.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard about that. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4925.0s)]
*  I've heard about that. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4927.0s)]
*  I mean, he's got a lot of stuff. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4929.0s)]
*  He's got a lot of stuff. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4931.0s)]
*  He's got a lot of stuff. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4933.0s)]
*  I've heard about that too. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4935.0s)]
*  I'm a big swimmer. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4937.0s)]
*  I'm like running. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4939.0s)]
*  I'm still getting my miles in. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4941.0s)]
*  But like I love just swimming. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4943.0s)]
*  I don't have like the best swimming. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4945.0s)]
*  But yeah, you don't get the same wear and tear on your body as you would get with all that extra stuff on there. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4947.0s)]
*  So that's your your favorite form of conditioning swimming? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4949.0s)]

*  And he only used to like swim a lap and then walk a lap. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4977.0s)]
*  And then swim a lap like he would not know how to swim. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=4979.0s)]

*  When I see him get interviewed or interviewing fighters, he looks like a bantamweight. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5009.0s)]
*  I tell him, I'm like, bro, you could make 135. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5011.0s)]
*  He's like walking around at 165. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5013.0s)]
*  When he used to cut weight, he'd be [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5015.0s)]
*  he'll come into camp like he would come to us when he would do his camps at Rootsport. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5017.0s)]
*  And he would sit there and like measure stuff before practice. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5019.0s)]
*  Like let me get six blueberries and like two almonds. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5021.0s)]
*  He was that guy because he was thick. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5023.0s)]
*  He was small. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5025.0s)]
*  He was pretty big. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5027.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm like, I can't live like that because people would always tell me like, oh, you need to go 155. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5029.0s)]
*  The first time I met Habib, he looked at me. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5031.0s)]
*  He's like, you're lightweight. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5033.0s)]

*  Yeah, I like this one makes no sense at all. Yeah, Drew Dober's bill like a brick shithouse [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5360.8s)]
*  It's he's a big boy for 55 to like I wonder what he actually walks around that he's gotta be in the 80s [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5367.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of these guys yeah [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5373.72s)]
*  So that's what he looks like at weight, but then you see him inside the arcturine. Well. That's all I think he is right there [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5376.0s)]
*  He's pretty thick [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5382.280000000001s)]
*  He's got a hell of a chin to man that dudes got the squares of square jaws [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5384.12s)]
*  And he used it a fight. I'm like oh my god [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5388.92s)]

*  Yeah, it's interesting to see a guy like him get smushed like when Islam smushed him you like man like what is that squeeze? [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5397.280000000001s)]
*  Like that has got to be some otherworldly squeeze. Yeah, I tell guys I'm like you never felt it [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5404.7s)]
*  It's it's different like they'll oh you just you just other nuts you do this and I'm like, bro [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5410.7s)]

*  I mean, I'm gonna like I've literally been messing with the guys trying to go to Dagestan [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5421.94s)]
*  but they're heading out to Australia now, but they have some guys that are out there, but I definitely want to go to Dagestan because [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5426.38s)]
*  I know Habib's done coaching right now, but is he done done. That's real [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5432.54s)]
*  Yeah, they said he's gonna be done. Why did he why did he decide to leave coaching? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5437.62s)]
*  Just spend more time with his family like I was telling people he goes when they're in camps. They're all in they're all like [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5442.86s)]
*  They're all together. They're like one big family where it's I'm gonna be every single practice with you [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5449.26s)]
*  I'm gonna be here and they're travel so much and for him. He has to corner this guy here [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5453.9s)]
*  then you got to go to all Australia, then you got to Vegas and [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5457.54s)]
*  You know he has two young kids and seeing how he is with his kids like he brought his son out [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5460.26s)]
*  To Dubai when we were out there [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5465.46s)]
*  And it was just cool to see because you never see that side of you never see their family like they don't post any of that [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5467.099999999999s)]
*  Or anything like there so it was cool to see it like him wrestling with his son [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5471.54s)]
*  And he was showing me videos of his son not doing gymnastics and his son's gonna be a beast [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5474.62s)]
*  So just seeing how he is like kind of like how you're smiling like there [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5478.62s)]
*  That's how he was when he was like showing me his video of the Sun so like you could tell that he misses them [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5482.54s)]
*  Yeah, and you know for him [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5485.98s)]
*  When he goes a corner somebody's not just cornering like there's when you're going to a different state every single person in that state [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5488.62s)]
*  Wants to see you they all want to touch you they all want to get a piece of you [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5494.34s)]
*  We were in Abu Dhabi and we went to go visit like the police department out there [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5497.58s)]
*  And you know we're all there before Habib so it's like me Islam like the whole team is there and nobody's saying nothing to us [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5501.9800000000005s)]
*  And I'm like you know Islam and all these guys are still here [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5509.1s)]
*  It's not five retidal [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5512.860000000001s)]
*  Like nobody's really caring that right when Habib walks in every single person runs out [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5513.78s)]
*  They were out with roses flowers like way for him to get out the car and following him [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5517.9s)]
*  And you just see he's just like a different level of superstar so [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5522.7s)]
*  for him he was also like telling me to like I just want to get I want to be able to [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5526.62s)]
*  Just go to Starbucks one time and just sit down and have coffee like I used to [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5532.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Muhammad Ali couldn't do that before he died [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5538.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know it's like you reach a certain level of fame when that's just hit forever, and that's where he's at [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5541.26s)]
*  I mean he's a legend forever [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5546.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, if he never coaches again never steps foot in a gym again that guy is a legend forever [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5548.42s)]
*  Yeah, and I was gonna sit him like if he stayed on this track. He would have been a goat coach [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5554.06s)]
*  He wouldn't be a good sure [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5558.58s)]
*  Hopefully I mean I want him to be happy [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5560.66s)]
*  I want him to do whatever he wants to do, but if he did decide to just do that to just coach I [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5562.9800000000005s)]
*  Man then the knowledge that guy hasn't also the the amount of motivation [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5571.38s)]
*  He could give people because you realize you're getting coached by the goat [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5576.1s)]
*  Yeah, you know and he doesn't ask for nothing in return. It's like he's giving you his time is that for he's on the match with [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5579.46s)]
*  You rolling and it's not like he didn't retire because he was out of shape or injured or anything like that [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5585.7s)]
*  He's still he's still that same Habib. He's still that same top pressure that same [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5590.62s)]
*  Strength grappling he's just heavier now. This is wild so he's just still moving like this heavyweight now [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5595.06s)]
*  Right, bro, and he's like he's still freaking so strong [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5601.14s)]
*  I'm sure and it's like when somebody's rolling with you under senator [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5604.620000000001s)]
*  Ordered me a starbucks. He's giving me like in a camora [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5609.22s)]
*  Like bro should I be like mad or like embarrassed and it's it's like humbling [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5612.42s)]
*  Yeah, there's guys out there like that and guys on his team that aren't in the UFC yet that are like that and you're learning [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5617.34s)]
*  Imagine those guys you're growing up your whole life learning from these guys his younger cousins Umar and Usman the Bellator champion [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5623.780000000001s)]
*  Umar who just fought this weekend. It's like they grew up under and fantastic [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5629.66s)]
*  Yeah, Umar's got a such a different style too. If you watch his style, yeah real light on his feet and great kicks [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5633.86s)]
*  He's got that great front kick that he throws and he like question marks it a lot [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5640.38s)]
*  He's very smooth with his smooth man and that combination that he threw that with that left hook and dropped him [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5644.86s)]
*  I mean that was amazing. Yeah amazing [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5651.46s)]
*  And that's just a small side of them like his grappling is still there same as their guys [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5653.82s)]
*  But he has that striking too and I tell people to your sleep on Islam striking all their guys [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5658.04s)]
*  They all know how to strike. They just know what wins was the pet the beat Oliver on the feet [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5662.12s)]
*  Yeah, you know over on the feet, you know and Umar has a real potential to be the champion. He really does man [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5666.2s)]
*  He's he's fucking good dude and honey. Barcellos is no no joke [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5672.36s)]
*  Yeah, how many is really good and for him to take him out like that. Nobody's ever beat him like that [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5676.12s)]
*  No, and no, he said he has he's a black belt [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5681.4800000000005s)]
*  He has I think he's like a judo guy to a great wrestler on the Brazilian team and he has it all [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5683.92s)]
*  the way that Umar just showed patience and [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5689.4400000000005s)]
*  They had that pressure just having that never give it off last name it's like people expect you to be great [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5693.52s)]
*  Yeah, so you're undefeated and your brother just won the Bellator title [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5699.4400000000005s)]
*  So you're going out there and he just relaxed calm cool and he's picking up his head waking him up afterward [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5703.14s)]
*  It's like they're humble this he hit him with the punch [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5708.8s)]
*  Realized he was out already and he went and grabbed the back of his head to help him [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5711.68s)]
*  Yeah, they're immediately all the guys and the humbleness [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5715.14s)]
*  It was another level and like learning from from them and like being religious myself, but it's a different culture [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5718.12s)]
*  in America, but being over there five weeks with those guys where [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5724.64s)]
*  there's [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5728.88s)]
*  Everything's to the tee everything's to the dot. Like I shared one of my my friend Horacio [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5729.88s)]
*  He was on that that show that [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5735.92s)]
*  Man's but I was on that Mexican [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5738.08s)]
*  Reality show he was on that show and I got shared like a video from him on that show and it was like [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5740.4s)]
*  Women in bikinis, but he was like it was more for him and he was like brother [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5745.2s)]
*  We shouldn't share that for us, you know be better at that [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5748.88s)]
*  I was like, oh, I was sure if my boys like I'll just share it with just him [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5752.88s)]
*  And I was like it makes sense because being a Muslim [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5755.64s)]
*  People look up to you. I see younger guys look up to me [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5758.26s)]
*  I don't want them to think that I'm this certain way [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5761.16s)]
*  Like I want to hold myself up to a higher standard [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5763.6s)]
*  They can't even look at the girls in bikinis and videos [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5765.6s)]
*  No, like you know, you should like no, you're not supposed to it's supposed to be like lower your gaze where it should only be [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5768.120000000001s)]
*  You on your you and your spouse or your wife or anything like that [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5773.92s)]
*  So that's what a that's what it should be that dude who fought with the guy with one eye who what's his name again? [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5777.240000000001s)]
*  Magomedov he actually got in a fight with someone in a mall in [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5783.84s)]
*  Dagestan because the guy was doing a public display of affection [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5789.4800000000005s)]
*  And he told him to cut it out the guy took a swing on him and he beat this dude's ass [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5794.24s)]
*  Oh really? Yeah, because apparently over there like you you can't even like kiss in public. Yeah, it's a different culture [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5797.76s)]
*  It's a different thing. It's not like [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5804.32s)]
*  It's it's not like out of like hate or anything like that [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5806.8s)]
*  It's just like you shouldn't be doing that [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5810.56s)]
*  you should if there's kids around there shouldn't be you tongue kissing with a girl in front of you or anything like that and [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5812.56s)]
*  Being a Muslim being religiously is it should be like in the household. That's where it should be [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5818.8s)]
*  It's just like holding yourself to different type of standards [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5822.76s)]
*  And obviously you want to show love and self with your wife hold hands [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5826.0s)]
*  You don't have to be freaking making out in public and everything like that. But in America, it's a different culture obviously and it's [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5829.6s)]
*  You start seeing now more like [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5836.360000000001s)]
*  Americanized Muslims where they're like, oh, well, what if you do it this way or that way? [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5838.64s)]
*  It's like no you can't just like switch what's in the Quran. You can't switch what's in written down already [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5842.12s)]
*  It's been like that for for [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5847.04s)]
*  How many years and and Dagestan? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5849.280000000001s)]
*  Everybody's like that. They all had that same mentality and being in Dubai and Abu Dhabi for those five weeks [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5852.4400000000005s)]
*  It was great for me because it was like [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5857.56s)]
*  Not an eye-opener, but it was just more like refreshing [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5859.96s)]
*  Because you're training and then you're here to call a prayer so every single person [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5862.88s)]
*  I don't care if you're the janitor or the the the workmen or the fighter or anything [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5866.88s)]
*  You're all going to pray at the same time. You're all shoulder to shoulder praying next to each other and [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5871.68s)]
*  There's no like ranking in that raw shoulder shoulder raw praying to the same [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5876.72s)]
*  God doing the same exact thing at the same exact time and you don't really get that kind of feeling in America [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5880.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like if I pull out my rug to pray on the street [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5885.240000000001s)]
*  At a certain time if people are looking at you weird like oh, what is this or you have random people just like beeping or saying? [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5888.8s)]
*  stupid things [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5894.8s)]
*  Because they don't understand what it is. They don't understand the discipline it is to [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5896.400000000001s)]
*  alright [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5901.68s)]
*  This is God's time now. This we supposed to pray five times a day. I don't care where it is [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5903.16s)]
*  What you're doing it needs to stop for this and every single one of those guys had that mentality like God [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5907.0s)]
*  Every prayer is probably like five ten minutes long [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5913.84s)]
*  So once you're once you begin the prayer, it's it's not that long [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5916.6s)]
*  So I got to help you all the time where they're like dang you had to pray five times a day [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5922.2s)]
*  But in the end it's 50 minutes out of your life 50 minutes out of your day out of 24 hours [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5925.8s)]
*  When you waste so much time scrolling through tik-tok scrolling through phone is things like that. It's like [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5930.360000000001s)]
*  Give those 10 minutes a day [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5935.4800000000005s)]
*  When you waste so much time scrolling through tik-tok scrolling through phone is things like that [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5937.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like give those 10 minutes to God give those 10 minutes to the person that brought you here [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5942.2s)]
*  How does it work on a day you fight? [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5947.12s)]
*  same thing [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5949.28s)]
*  Usually so there's a morning prayer when you wake up in the morning prayer, then there's afternoon [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5950.639999999999s)]
*  Then there's a midday prayer and then there's a sunset prayer right when it sunsets [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5954.959999999999s)]
*  So usually I'm right after that prayers the fights after that probably and then after the fight you pray again [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5959.16s)]
*  Dear your late night prayer. So [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5966.0s)]
*  For me also just hold you accountable to to no matter what happens in the fight whether you win or lose [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5968.88s)]
*  I still have to I still owe to God to pray whether it's I'm thanking him for a win [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5975.64s)]
*  Or I'm thanking him that I'm still able to pray. I'm still alive right now [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5981.44s)]
*  After this fight that I'm still here because these things happen [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5985.84s)]
*  These prayers are at very specific times during the day or could if you were in the middle of something [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5988.8s)]
*  Are you allowed to put it off and then pray afterwards? So you have a time frame? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5993.64s)]
*  So from the morning prayer you have all the way until the afternoon prayer to do it [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=5997.12s)]
*  Then from the afternoon prayer you have to the midday prayer [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6001.8s)]
*  And then there's some people that I tell people all the time like when you're starting out if you pray or pray or late [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6003.6s)]
*  Do it late like get the quantity in and then work on the quality later [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6009.04s)]
*  But at least get the quantity in first so, you know, you have to pray five times a day [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6013.92s)]
*  So when you're beginning out, there's so many people that they come in and my coach is a convert Louis Taylor [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6017.12s)]
*  He's he converted to Islam and you know, he had so many people telling oh you can't do this [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6023.5199999999995s)]
*  You can't do this. You can't do this. Why are you wearing this? [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6027.679999999999s)]
*  And it was just like turning them off from the whole thing. It's like I was born from a different culture [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6029.919999999999s)]
*  I was born doing different things. My family isn't Muslim [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6034.719999999999s)]
*  So I I'm if I'm with them and you see me hanging out with people that do these type of things [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6037.919999999999s)]
*  Don't come here and cry to me like I thought bro go at your own pace start patiently [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6042.5s)]
*  If you missed the morning prayer, I hit both of them in the afternoon [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6046.959999999999s)]
*  If you missed that I hit that one in the mid midday [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6050.44s)]
*  But just get the quantity in talk to God it centers you a lot of the time too because [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6054.04s)]
*  And those ten minutes you're not stressing you're not thinking about the stress of the life [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6060.36s)]
*  Oh, I gotta I gotta get this done. I gotta get this done [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6064.24s)]
*  I got to get this done that normal people have in the workday. I think it's kind of like a meditation for me and [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6066.08s)]
*  It just clears my mind clears my head and knowing that I got it done and at the end of the day [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6073.16s)]
*  I know that I did five my five prayers. I that's the most important thing. I don't care. Oh man [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6077.8s)]
*  I forgot to do my homework. I forgot to do this [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6082.84s)]
*  I forgot to do the stuff that I was supposed to do for work [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6085.52s)]
*  But it's like I did the most important things which is pray and when you're in a camp [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6087.400000000001s)]
*  I would imagine that that kind of [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6092.72s)]
*  Having a rigid schedule like that and having extreme discipline and having a real purpose [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6096.360000000001s)]
*  Like when you're doing this to pray to God and you have these five prayers you do during the day [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6101.2s)]
*  Like it keeps you on the path [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6105.96s)]
*  Yeah, it I mean those guys there's something to whatever [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6108.64s)]
*  Khabib's doing that's not just technique. It's not just that they have great technique. It's not just that they're tough guys [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6112.84s)]
*  There's also this devout [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6119.2s)]
*  sort of [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6122.08s)]
*  Ideology that they've ascribed to that they that they live their life by there [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6124.32s)]
*  They're so devout in their religious beliefs. They have so much confidence. It's almost like that's all taken care of [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6129.46s)]
*  Like they can just concentrate on on what they do. Yes that all you know, God has a plan for everything [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6135.92s)]
*  You don't have to like have this existential angst that a lot of people roll around through life with [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6141.84s)]
*  Yeah, we have a thing called to what this means like [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6147.12s)]
*  God's will so whatever his will is that's what it is [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6150.64s)]
*  So you could sit there and train and be super stressed out and like am I gonna win or am I gonna lose this fight? [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6153.56s)]
*  It's like you just tell yourself whatever God's will that's what's meant to be [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6158.88s)]
*  I've had I've lost on the biggest stage. I've lost [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6163.12s)]
*  My debut in the UFC. I'm coming undefeated. I'm like I lose a close fight and [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6167.48s)]
*  I'm telling you why did God do this to me? [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6172.8s)]
*  Like I pray five times a day like I I'm a good person I do this and it's like [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6174.68s)]
*  When you thinking back to that it all brought you to where you are today [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6178.5599999999995s)]
*  So knowing that his plan is always the best plan no matter what so now when I look back at the losses [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6182.48s)]
*  I've had it's like maybe I want to be where I am right now [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6187.5s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't be as tough as I am I want to be as smart as I am I wouldn't have changed [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6190.2s)]
*  The ways I've trained and I think that all of these guys had that mentality is you don't have the the fear of losing [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6193.96s)]
*  because if I lose I was meant to lose if I [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6201.32s)]
*  If I fail it was for a reason there's a bigger plan in the end and God may not show it to you now [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6205.12s)]
*  but he may show to you in a couple years he may show it to you and the next life and [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6211.639999999999s)]
*  Because I go into every fight and I tell I'm asking God because we put our head down to the ground and [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6216.0s)]
*  That's when you're like closest to God when we pray and it's called Sajud so when you're putting your head down [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6223.320000000001s)]
*  you're talking to the highest and [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6228.52s)]
*  you you know you you talk deep from the heart because that's basically kind of like your face-to-face with God and I always tell [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6231.280000000001s)]
*  Him before a fight [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6237.72s)]
*  I'm like if it's gonna make me a better person a better Muslim grant me this victory if it's not [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6238.280000000001s)]
*  The Grammy the loss if it's gonna make me a worse person it's gonna give me an ego it's gonna make me unhumbled [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6242.12s)]
*  It's gonna make me [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6247.64s)]
*  Worse to the people that I love and the people that matter to me most is my family [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6248.92s)]
*  Then I don't want to win. I don't want the victory. I don't want the wealth and [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6252.64s)]
*  Just having that like that sense of [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6256.68s)]
*  Whatever happens happens. It's meant to happen. I think it just changes everything [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6260.6s)]
*  Well, it's gotta give you a feeling of peace because so many people that that if I think that for a fighter [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6264.5199999999995s)]
*  Having a religion like that and especially being devout it does have an advantage and that that's one more thing [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6270.4400000000005s)]
*  You don't have to think about yeah, you know you don't have to and it also just builds you up from you when you're a kid [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6276.12s)]
*  Just the discipline of yeah, I know I have to do this this and this every single day. I'm not allowed to [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6282.88s)]
*  Eat this I'm not allowed to eat pork. I'm not allowed to do this. I'm not allowed to gamble [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6288.52s)]
*  I'm not allowed to play drink or anything like that [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6292.8s)]
*  So it puts you in those things and a lot of those things are words for you as a fighter anyway [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6294.76s)]
*  Like you shouldn't be drinking you shouldn't be eating pork. You shouldn't be going to clubs or anything like that [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6299.44s)]
*  so in the end, I think it's like the [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6303.48s)]
*  Being that's why you've seen most of the Muslims starting to be the best fighters out there [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6306.719999999999s)]
*  Well, it's also coming from really tough camps, too [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6311.24s)]
*  I mean that is having a great camp is just such a massive advantage [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6314.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean and you must feel that having trained Khabib and his boys [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6319.04s)]
*  Like that having an elite camp like that when you're surrounded by killers [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6323.0s)]
*  Like you must rise up to the level of your competition that you're surrounded by. Yeah, you have to there's no [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6327.36s)]
*  there's not no weak link in that gym every single person and [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6333.12s)]
*  There is a monster like, you know, you have your regular gyms [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6336.759999999999s)]
*  And you know that I could go with this guy because I'm feeling sore today. I'm feeling tired today [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6340.82s)]
*  Let me roll with him. Yeah, because a little bit and just go smooth [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6346.16s)]
*  No, then it's like you know, oh you're gonna oh you want to go with me you pick me. All right, let's go [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6348.96s)]
*  And it's like wait wait, you know, okay [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6353.599999999999s)]
*  I thought you were 135 pounder. He's so strong and he's so it good bro [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6355.58s)]
*  like I've rolled with Umar before I was like dude this guy is like a monster and [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6359.62s)]
*  They don't have that fear themselves where you go to gyms [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6363.74s)]
*  It's like oh well the bantam weights on this side the light weights on this side this side. No, they're all going together [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6366.22s)]
*  What what do they do for strength and conditioning? [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6371.42s)]
*  a [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6374.26s)]
*  lot of their stuff is just they do a lot of normal stuff after practice that [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6375.34s)]
*  Like burnouts with will hold a plank [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6379.98s)]
*  Heavy plank after we just grapple sparring everything will stay on our hands [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6383.14s)]
*  We have to stay there for two minutes three minutes until like I've been sees you like breaking and then I push-ups then jump squats [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6387.3s)]
*  Then lunges and it's I think it's those little burnouts after practice when you're tired and your arms are dead [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6394.02s)]
*  That levels you up with strength, but they also do have a strength coach that they would do twice or three times a week [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6399.7s)]
*  while we were in Abu Dhabi that he would put them more through like [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6406.18s)]
*  High reps for time so they'll go from like [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6409.82s)]
*  Doing shoulder presses to punch in the bag doing box box jumps to like kick in the bag little things like that [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6412.98s)]
*  That I think just like build strength and cardio at the same time when you are in Chicago [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6420.0199999999995s)]
*  Do you have like a regular strength conditioning coach that you work with? Yeah? Yeah, I got a strength coach shots Matt Murphy we do [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6425.0599999999995s)]
*  More like heavy lifting stuff, so really so for like certain bodies, so we do [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6432.58s)]
*  Deadlifts I'm going heavy on deadlifts. We go squats. I'm going heavy on squats we go [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6437.74s)]
*  Bench press and then all the other stuff is more like cosmetic [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6443.139999999999s)]
*  But like the basis trying to look good the not cosmetic but like I would now we're gonna do these little [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6447.54s)]
*  Rolls or something like this. Yeah [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6453.9s)]
*  And then farmer walks, yeah farmer walks, so when you're [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6457.82s)]
*  Doing this stuff like when you're saying you're doing heavy like how do you do that? [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6462.34s)]
*  And heavy like how heavy are you going? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6466.66s)]
*  Are you are you doing a lot of like reps for strength or for conditioning or is most of the shit? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6468.74s)]
*  You're doing heavy stuff so out of camp. I'm doing more more heavy so right now [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6475.0199999999995s)]
*  It's just like a strength building phase and then once it gets into camp mode, then it's more for reps [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6479.9s)]
*  So like right now. It's heavy with low reps, so if I'm benching it's maybe [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6486.22s)]
*  250 for like four or five reps [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6492.1s)]
*  But they're like cluster sets where I'm putting it back on then I bring it back down [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6494.74s)]
*  Then I explode back up with it and then with squats [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6498.3s)]
*  It's sitting down on a chair and then exploding up sitting down on the chair and then exploding up with it [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6501.22s)]
*  But it's heavier, but it's just lighter reps [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6505.74s)]
*  And then when it gets closer to the fight he changes it up to like higher rep stuff for the conditioning aspect of it [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6508.74s)]
*  Are you trying to put weight on with this heavy weight, or you just trying to maintain your strength? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6515.02s)]
*  I'm just trying to build more strength and explosiveness, so I want to get stronger especially [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6518.94s)]
*  Once you're in the the next guy my whoever my next opponent would be I figured it would be a stronger guy [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6523.86s)]
*  Heavy grappler, so I figured I would need the the strength, and I'm not the biggest welterweight [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6529.46s)]
*  so I want to make up for it with strength and [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6534.9s)]
*  Explosiveness like that, and I think [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6538.94s)]
*  When people look at me they don't think that I'm strong [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6540.98s)]
*  But when they feel me inside the cage then I feel like it's a lot of them guys get like their eyes open like oh [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6543.099999999999s)]
*  He's a lot stronger than I thought [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6548.42s)]
*  Yeah, there's certain dudes that are just strong as shit, and they don't look like it [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6550.46s)]
*  Yeah, but you look strong, but there's certain dudes. It's [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6554.42s)]
*  Strengthed like Ben Askren oh [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6558.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like certain strength like how the fuck is that guy like when you'd watch him fighting Bellator when he was in his prime? [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6562.1s)]
*  When they're like he was ragdolling like really high level fighters, and you're like how what is going on here? [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6567.58s)]
*  I know it's technique, but that motherfucker seems strong as shit [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6574.82s)]
*  I used to train with him when I would go down to Rufusport, and I would like drive down there once a week [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6578.219999999999s)]
*  It's like two hours away from Chicago [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6583.0199999999995s)]
*  but I would go in there and I would train with them and I'm like we're sparring with big gloves on and [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6584.78s)]
*  You know he was the best striker, so I'm feeling like I'm lighting him up, but once he grabs a hold of you [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6590.7s)]
*  It's like he takes you down, and you cannot move once you're on bottom [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6595.74s)]
*  It is with big gloves on and like you really it's really hard to grapple and hold people down with big gloves on [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6599.54s)]
*  But like so after that every time I'll go with him [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6604.04s)]
*  I was like I cannot let him grab his hands together if he locks his hands together [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6607.32s)]
*  I'm going down and that was when he was still in Bellator and like you said people don't realize how good he was [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6609.8s)]
*  Back then when he came to the UFC. It was a different version of himself [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6615.64s)]
*  Yeah, he was already worn out by the time he got to the UFC here. He needed a hip replacement. You know like [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6619.36s)]
*  Unfortunately, we didn't get him in his prime [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6625.6s)]
*  He was in his prime when he's in Bellator even before he went to 1fc [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6627.16s)]
*  You know 1fc didn't even really get him in his prime Bellator had him in his prime [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6630.5199999999995s)]
*  And if you watch some of those fights, they're very impressive and but Bellator didn't like it. They thought that style was boring [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6634.799999999999s)]
*  I'm like you got a dude who could do whatever the fuck he wants to people [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6641.28s)]
*  But he did the Koroshkov I mean like my god and Koroshkov still killing it right now [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6645.04s)]
*  that was in his primer younger version of himself and [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6649.48s)]
*  To have Ben just maul you and take you down at will yeah [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6653.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like I tell people it's harder to beat somebody for five rounds than it is to finish him in the first round [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6657.08s)]
*  It's like if I could beat you dominate you for 25 straight minutes [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6662.96s)]
*  That's a harder task than me going out there and finishing you in one minute one kick [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6666.92s)]
*  That's it like those guys get all the credit [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6671.08s)]
*  But it's like the guys like Ben those are the ones that are having to push through for those full 25 minutes [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6673.2s)]
*  Dominating knowing that all it takes is one punch or one kick and they avoided all of that got to be a real champion at [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6678.56s)]
*  One-fc-one and Bellator and he just doesn't get the credit. I was like people don't make sense [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6684.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, it's interesting to watch someone who's like a real specialist and Ben and his prime was a real specialist [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6688.639999999999s)]
*  Where he really wasn't a good striker he really didn't submit guys [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6695.32s)]
*  But man if you got to hold you you are gonna get wrestle fucked. Yeah [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6698.84s)]
*  Duke Rufus literally show like [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6704.44s)]
*  Sparring drills if I were gonna do striking drills and Ben will just be like standing there with his hands behind his back [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6706.599999999999s)]
*  Just like looking up at the sky the highway for sparring and he's like not doing the drilling at all [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6711.44s)]
*  What the heck but that's what I was like when he was boxing Jake [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6717.08s)]
*  Yeah, I was wondering how serious he's gonna take sound like I don't he doesn't take striking serious at all [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6720.48s)]
*  And if you if you're a guy like Jake who's who's athletic he's tough. He's strong [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6725.839999999999s)]
*  All that takes is one punch to land. I'm like, yeah [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6731.2s)]
*  I don't think Ben just took that fight serious at all [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6733.48s)]
*  And he's one of those guys that I think nobody takes a loss better than like a Ben Ashgren [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6735.719999999999s)]
*  He got knocked out by Mads but I said well that sucked that yeah tweeted [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6740.68s)]
*  I was like, I'm a terrible loser if I lose like I don't want you to talk to me [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6743.9s)]
*  I don't want to see anybody. I don't want it [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6748.36s)]
*  I don't want you guys to come near me [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6749.68s)]
*  So to like see you guys like that [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6751.92s)]
*  It's kind of like you want to learn from guys like that [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6753.72s)]
*  Honestly how to relax and yeah be yourself after a loss. Yeah boy. He he got ruthlessly [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6756.12s)]
*  Taunted on the internet to all that memes of him. Yeah [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6762.64s)]
*  And that's what it sucks when you see guys like that who were oh geez him and Woodley and [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6766.92s)]
*  When they lose like that and the world forgets that they were at the top [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6772.64s)]
*  They were tyrant was one of the best Walter weights of all time [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6776.52s)]
*  Yeah, Tyron in his prime was a bad motherfucker when he knocked [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6779.0s)]
*  I mean he he knocked out so many guys [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6782.52s)]
*  But when he beat up Darren till when Darren till was the man and Darren till was on his way up [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6785.36s)]
*  He dropped him with a punch and strangle him [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6790.18s)]
*  Dude people forget the Wonder Boy fights [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6792.54s)]
*  He was the one who had Wonder Boy hurt Wonder Boy who's the great striker? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6795.5s)]
*  Yeah, never really had him hurt. Yeah at all in either one of those fights [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6798.740000000001s)]
*  No, I mean they were kind of boring fights [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6802.780000000001s)]
*  But again unless you're gonna fight him the way you fought him [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6804.4800000000005s)]
*  I feel like you got to fight Wonder Boy in a boring fight [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6807.42s)]
*  You got to make him lead if he doesn't lead if you're coming at him [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6810.3s)]
*  His counters are so nasty and his distance is management of distance is so good. There's nobody better [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6813.780000000001s)]
*  I think at distance and John Jones [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6819.46s)]
*  I'm very interested to see how he comes back now though. Yeah years off. Well, it's really interesting [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6822.42s)]
*  Yeah, and so bummed out man. I do not like this whole thing. I do not like this at all [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6828.320000000001s)]
*  I do not like when a champion leaves [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6834.66s)]
*  I do not like I don't I do not like having the best guy in the world not being the champion [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6836.22s)]
*  I do not like the best guy in the world not fighting for the title against John if like if Francis wanted to resign and [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6841.740000000001s)]
*  He wanted to say I'm done [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6848.26s)]
*  I had a great career, but I made some money and I'm gonna relax. Yeah, okay [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6850.1s)]
*  Congratulations, sir. You had a great career [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6854.9800000000005s)]
*  But to not make it through negotiations. I don't know what the deal is [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6857.14s)]
*  I suspect some of it involved him wanting to be able to box as well [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6861.620000000001s)]
*  Because there may very well be a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6866.58s)]
*  But I don't know because Tyson Fury is back to fighting real boxers. Yeah, he's fighting usic now and [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6870.06s)]
*  There's a diathe wilder fight out there. I feel like but well [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6876.38s)]
*  You really want if you're Francis, do you want to fight a wilder? [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6879.66s)]
*  Who's he has that one punch power, right? At least with fury [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6883.38s)]
*  I feel like fury will dance around with you a little bit. Let you show something [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6886.46s)]
*  Well, I think isn't Deontay supposed to fight Andy Ruiz isn't that what's all that? Oh, yeah, I think so. Is that true? [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6889.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, Jamie says so it's not booked. It's talked about well [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6895.5199999999995s)]
*  Andy Ruiz versus Francis would be interesting. That would be a fun one. That'd be interesting because Andy's got some fucking hands [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6899.7s)]
*  Fast yeah, so if Andy an in shape Andy Ruiz like he was when he fought Joshua damn he's got some handspeed [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6906.3s)]
*  I'm a big fan of Andy Ruiz, but that second fight with Joshua. He just got so fat [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6913.5s)]
*  You could tell he's like that is the money. That was the fat party in yeah [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6918.5s)]
*  I'm like women and you know [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6923.18s)]

*  You're talking about I don't got a fancy car. I got a Rolls Royce [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6944.62s)]
*  Oh, he was balled out of control and I think he was partying too and he had a group of boys with him [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6947.14s)]
*  You know, they were having a good time, you know [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6951.46s)]
*  You come from nothing. Also near the heavyweight champion of the world [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6953.9800000000005s)]

*  What do you think about the other boxy fight Garcia against a tank Oh man, Jervonta I hope they make that one [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6967.18s)]
*  Jervonta something he's so unique. He's so Jervonta is so interesting because he I think I [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6973.700000000001s)]
*  Think if you look at all the active boxers who are champions, he may throw the least amount of punches [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6981.62s)]
*  Yeah, because he sets guys up and so the first few rounds he's just [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6986.740000000001s)]
*  Calculating you trying to find your openings [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6992.1s)]
*  Testing you moving towards like the first his first round of his last fight [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6995.06s)]
*  I mean how many punches yeah, like very few. Yeah, but goddamn when he hits you you're fucked. Yeah that dude can crack [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=6999.46s)]
*  He's so good. He's so accurate and he's so sneaky the way he like dips to the side and cuts in uppercuts and his power [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7006.7s)]
*  Man, his power is just extraordinary. I am really interested to see if Ryan Garcia can handle that [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7014.58s)]
*  I don't know. I mean Garcia is fast. He's he's got a great countering. He says I love fighting southpaws [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7020.54s)]
*  I'm the I'm the softball killer but yeah [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7026.0199999999995s)]
*  Why is Oscar Dale? Oh, I got fake abs. You seen that no way does he row? [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7029.5s)]
*  I think Dale Ahoy has got some fake abs go to plants. Yes, something's going on man [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7033.46s)]
*  Oscar Dale Ahoy, I didn't have abs throughout his boxing career. Look at him now [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7039.66s)]
*  Get the heck out of here [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7044.38s)]
*  Bro, what's going on there? It's either either he's got some fake abs or he's going semi-glutide [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7045.66s)]
*  One of the other but the thing is like his abs don't match his chest or his arms [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7054.46s)]
*  You know what? Look how defined his abs are. Look they even when he's sitting there. He's like the liver king. Look at this here [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7059.42s)]
*  They're like fully tight. I [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7067.1s)]
*  Mean the thing is it's like he's not that low body fat [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7069.900000000001s)]
*  This is why it's confusing if you like look at his body like his arms and his shoulders when a guy has [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7075.34s)]
*  Abs like that. Generally, they're really shredded. That's weird. Yeah [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7082.26s)]
*  Yeah, generally you have low body fat in your chest like everything looks defined if your abs look that defined [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7085.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, when your abs are that defined the rest use not that defined [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7091.54s)]
*  Like all these people are claiming that he got ab implants maybe he didn't [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7095.860000000001s)]
*  Damn [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7105.58s)]
*  Is that real like yeah, that's wow, that's crazy [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7107.66s)]
*  They look a lot better than I think that liver King dude has them for sure. Oh man [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7111.18s)]
*  He has to show that he didn't [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7115.88s)]
*  They like he was twisting his body in certain ways and they kind of go away when he moves in certain directions, right? [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7118.18s)]
*  But did these go away? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7123.66s)]
*  These are actual like things in your body click on that one with the belly and the guy right next to him right where your cursor is [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7125.82s)]
*  Yeah, click on that one [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7131.42s)]
*  That's no way they can do that. This is etching etching [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7133.54s)]
*  Maybe that's what Oscar did maybe like they dug like a knife in there. That's crazy show up [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7138.26s)]
*  I think when they say etching what they use is liposuction is out but is that real? [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7143.139999999999s)]
*  That's what this is but is it but that photo from that photo is that real? [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7148.5s)]
*  Because that look that guy looks like legitimately jacked [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7152.22s)]
*  Yeah, you know I'm saying like he looks like those would be his abs. I don't know [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7154.7s)]
*  I mean that this is from a men's health article. So they might be full of shit. Let me go go back to those images [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7158.9400000000005s)]
*  So maybe that's what Oscar did maybe he did etching [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7167.38s)]
*  But it's like all the sudden he's got abs out of nowhere and he's showing everybody [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7170.740000000001s)]
*  That's so crazy very look at that one. Is that a woman? What is that right there with the blonde? [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7175.860000000001s)]
*  I'm not looking at what you're looking at [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7182.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah laser pointer man, I [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7186.22s)]
*  Think this is the we might have pulled is that a dude? Yeah, the fuck's going on there [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7188.900000000001s)]
*  Is that like one of the surgery guys? Oh [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7192.900000000001s)]
*  No, yeah. Oh that guy's insane Kendall. Oh, yeah, that guy said he does have like those do right here. Go to that do right there [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7195.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's preposterous. Oh, that's a sweet big fat belly with some crazy fake abs [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7203.860000000001s)]
*  The ab thing is weird so that is that what they look like that thing right there [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7209.42s)]
*  Let me see what they look like [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7213.86s)]
*  Which ones are you looking at there? Well laser pointer, bro. I'm not looking at that screen. Look at my laser pointer [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7215.86s)]
*  So is that what they look like they're like little gelatinous thing. Oh, this is so disgusting [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7224.06s)]
*  This is like a bad one. I don't know if that's what they're [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7229.34s)]
*  Oh [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7231.34s)]
*  Yeah, that guy's got abs and nothing else [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7232.34s)]
*  And nothing else that's what's weird is like people get ab implants [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7235.339999999999s)]
*  But the rest of their body looks like dog shit like we have like why would you want it? Yeah, how bad you? [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7240.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7246.82s)]
*  Narcissism yeah narcissism. That's exactly what it is [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7247.98s)]
*  Fucking weirdos [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7252.099999999999s)]
*  But that's what people are accusing Oscar doing it doesn't look right though. It just looks weird [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7255.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like you said you didn't have it during boxing when you're in your peak shape [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7260.419999999999s)]
*  So that doesn't look too terrible right there that just looks like he's flexing. It's the side abs or obliques [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7264.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, those look pretty strong. Yeah, it looks pretty good [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7270.099999999999s)]
*  But but it's by stone. Yeah [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7273.82s)]
*  It's just weird when one area of your body is like very defined all the sudden [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7277.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's what's weird is that it's all the sudden. Yeah, Mike. My girl is doing a 75 day hard [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7282.54s)]
*  It's like you do two workouts a day one indoors and one outdoors for 45 minutes each time [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7288.379999999999s)]
*  Then you pick it any diet you want to do you can do any type of diet you want but you have to stick to [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7294.299999999999s)]
*  It for 75 days and you have to read like a motivational book 10 pages every single day that would wear me out [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7298.299999999999s)]
*  It's she's like the books the motivational books [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7305.419999999999s)]
*  But her motivation is I better have abs at the end of this 75 days [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7307.54s)]
*  I'm like I mean if you're eating healthy and you're working out twice a day [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7310.58s)]
*  I'm pretty sure you have at least two abs [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7313.58s)]
*  Depends on what you start from though, right? Yeah. Yeah. So what do you think of this John Jones zero gone fight? [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7317.0199999999995s)]
*  Honestly, I think it's a [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7323.1s)]
*  It's a tougher fight than Francis. Really? I do I think that zero got his movement his footwork [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7325.14s)]
*  He's so good with his front leg and for John Jones [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7332.54s)]
*  Who when I remember when he came back from OSP, he looks so stiff [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7336.660000000001s)]
*  And that was a time off and putting a lot of muscle on he just looked like a slower version of himself [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7339.900000000001s)]
*  So now this time it's a longer time off and you're coming back with way more weight on and you're going against one of like [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7345.26s)]
*  The faster heavy weights and the more smoother heavy weights instead of getting gone you were you know, he lands that hard punch [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7351.86s)]
*  I could do it but I could just shoot under that hard punch and got you [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7357.86s)]
*  I mean a zero gone you have to watch the kicks watch the footwork cut him off [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7360.78s)]
*  Yeah [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7365.62s)]
*  The thing is the serial gone was out grappled by Francis when Francis had a bad knee [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7366.9s)]
*  Francis's knee was fucked up and Francis out grappled up and beat him handily with a grappling [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7372.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7377.339999999999s)]
*  You know, I talked to Eric Nixic and he said Francis is grappling is on a totally different level than he used to be before [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7377.86s)]
*  And he's so big and so strong. Yeah, like, you know, he's in camp with Blagoje [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7382.86s)]
*  Even off. Yeah, and he said he was just holding him down doing every once to him [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7388.339999999999s)]
*  I'm like that is really impressive because Blagoje beat [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7391.9s)]
*  Fador in combat Sambo. He's a monster. He's a monster. He's one of got like stabbed, right? Yeah in the heart [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7395.46s)]
*  Yeah, he's yeah one time I saw that uh [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7401.259999999999s)]
*  You know, he's under Ali and we Ali had like a media day for his fighters and Blagoje like comes up to me and like [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7405.58s)]
*  I make pics every [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7412.0199999999995s)]
*  Every fight and I like circle fighters where I think is gonna win now posted on my Instagram [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7413.259999999999s)]
*  And he like came up to me. He like shoulder pump. He's like you didn't pick me my last fight [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7416.7s)]
*  And I was like, I was like what I was like, dude [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7421.44s)]
*  I don't even think I don't even know you fighters even really pay attention [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7424.36s)]
*  I was like, dude, I now I started realizing that these guys are like watching it. But uh, of course they watch [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7426.82s)]
*  Yeah, I was like this guy's crazy, but I was like man I gotta pick him every single time he goes [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7432.6s)]
*  That's like nuts [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7437.4400000000005s)]
*  But yeah, I always talk to Eric Nixon Eric Nixon's one of those coaches that he's like my brother Rob call him after hey [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7438.92s)]
*  I they're giving me this guy. What do you think about it? [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7444.64s)]
*  and he would always tell me like Francis is Francis one of those heavyweights that loves to wrestle like [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7446.52s)]
*  You know wrestling practice strikers. They don't show up. They don't they hate to be in that grinds a different type of grind [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7451.68s)]
*  They said Francis is there all the time. He loves to be in that [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7457.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, especially after that steep a fight the first deep a fight he learned like that's where his Achilles heel is [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7461.22s)]
*  Grappling and that also you can't take everybody out like sometimes like not in that fight at least steep a just [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7467.74s)]
*  Weathered the storm somehow or another yeah [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7474.86s)]
*  And you have to have the gas tank and you have to have the grappling to survive all those other exchanges [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7477.46s)]
*  But that was at his moment [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7483.02s)]
*  Remember when he was just knocking everybody out and he had like two minutes of fight time [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7484.86s)]
*  Yeah, then all of a sudden you fight a guy. Oh, thanks pass the second round [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7488.58s)]
*  Well, it's also like we talked about with hums. I when hums I went after Kevin Holland if you get out of that round [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7491.42s)]
*  How much do you have left? Yeah? He got out of the round steep a made it out of the round and then steep [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7496.34s)]
*  He started dominating but that second fight man [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7500.84s)]
*  Francis is take down defense. He looked good patient Francis. That's what DC was saying patient Francis is scary Francis [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7503.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I'm mad. Yeah, I'm mad cuz I feel like we were deprived of one of the great [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7510.5s)]
*  Fights in MMA one of the most compelling fights in MMA does it mean I'm not interested in serial gone and John Jones [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7516.58s)]
*  I'm very interested in that fight. I'm very for all the things you listed also for serial guns performance against tied to Ivasha [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7523.860000000001s)]
*  It's like goddamn serial gone and serial gone does a lot of shit [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7529.780000000001s)]
*  That's very unusual like first of all he stands totally sideways [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7534.02s)]
*  And he does like a twisting kick with his front leg to throw a front kick. You know yeah, yeah, very weird [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7537.900000000001s)]
*  Yes, he stands totally sideways, and he like twists his leg in he doesn't stick it up and stab it forward [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7544.26s)]
*  He like twists it and go in yeah, you never did that well tight window. It's a twisting kick. Yeah. Yeah, it's called a twisting. Okay, yeah [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7551.42s)]
*  So no that's him throwing side kicks [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7560.54s)]
*  He throws this kick off the front leg if you go to tie to Ivasha [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7565.7s)]
*  The one he was landing to that front to the body [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7569.82s)]
*  Oh my god dude [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7572.54s)]
*  Ty is so tough though man [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7573.54s)]
*  He's so tough [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7574.54s)]
*  Ty is so tough that was a crazy ass fight [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7575.62s)]
*  and that was a perfect fight to like showcase what serial guns capable of because his [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7578.62s)]
*  His movement the fluidity of his combinations and I mean the guy moves like a middleweight. Yeah, it's 240 plus pounds [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7582.62s)]
*  This was a great ass fight [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7590.26s)]
*  So he stands sideways and he throws this front kick when he gets distance [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7592.26s)]
*  He throws this front kick off the sideways stance and he turns his body [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7598.46s)]
*  Oh, there's that kick to the body those those round kicks. Oh, this is the finishing vote secret. Oh, yeah [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7603.46s)]
*  Very very interesting man watching the two there it is. Yeah. Yeah, see how he throws it and he throws it off of both sides with the front leg [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7612.46s)]
*  He's the most agile and the the like probably the most technical of all the heavyweight strikers [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7621.46s)]
*  Serials very well rounded when it comes to his striking [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7629.46s)]
*  He's so smooth. Yeah, so and he's like intelligent like he understands with the distance. All right. That's the knee distance [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7633.46s)]
*  This is not kick distance very interesting fight. So for John it's gonna be Ken John take him down [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7639.46s)]
*  Ken John like how does John perform at heavyweight? [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7645.46s)]
*  Can John close the distance is he is fast? What is the three years off like is he hungrier and even better? [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7647.46s)]
*  Because he's fired up and he you know, like y'all must have forgot. He's got that mindset [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7653.46s)]
*  He usually does too. Right? Remember he was always that guy that would want to beat you at your own game [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7657.46s)]
*  Oh, you're a wrestler. I'll rustle you you're a striker. I'll strike with you. Yeah, so well comes out there thinking [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7661.46s)]
*  Zero gone. You're a [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7667.46s)]
*  Smooth striker. I'll smooth you. I don't know. It's also a first fight at heavyweight [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7669.46s)]
*  We really don't know how he's gonna respond when he gets hit by a big heavyweight [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7672.46s)]
*  We don't know anything. Yeah, and it's years and it's also John is older now, you know [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7675.46s)]
*  It's just a tight ball honestly a lot of partying. Yeah, John parties. You know, I don't know what he's been doing [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7680.46s)]
*  Maybe he's been living clean over the last few years. I don't know. I know I saw him with a sahoodo now and [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7686.46s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's a little might so will help him too. So I like that. I like sahoodo's mindset [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7692.46s)]
*  I like that fight ready camp. I think what Henry brings to the table is very unique [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7697.46s)]
*  His mindset is really incredible and you know, I talked to mighty mouse about it. I had mighty mouse on and [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7702.46s)]
*  Demetrius was saying that like he's so meticulous in his training and how he prepares and plans for things [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7708.46s)]
*  Yeah, like his everything is like very very focused. I was thought Dan Ege [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7713.46s)]
*  He was telling me how he went down there and he was he's like I never talked to anybody with [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7717.46s)]
*  Kind of like the war mindset as him. It's like he sees it as like a chess match. He breaks it down in that type of [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7722.46s)]
*  Way it's not like all the squad there see red whatever happens happens [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7728.46s)]
*  He does this this and this even with the I said I had breakfast with him once before the Sean Brady fight [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7732.46s)]
*  And he was like, let's watch a little tape on him. Let's let me look up what he what he does and [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7738.46s)]
*  Just like watching one tape of Sean Brady. Oh, well, he stands like this [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7743.46s)]
*  I think you should could do this. This little kid will be perfect right here [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7746.46s)]
*  But just seeing how he breaks down how he talks people [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7748.46s)]
*  It just tells me that being a coach and being at his gym [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7751.46s)]
*  He'll get deeper and deeper and deeper into those little aspects of the fight that a lot of people don't really care about or look at [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7754.46s)]
*  A lot of I know a lot of fighters that they'll never even watch tape of somebody they're gonna fight [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7760.46s)]
*  They'll never they're just going there with the mindset of if I'm in shape and I'm on my bus. I'm gonna win [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7764.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's one of the great coaches out there [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7768.46s)]
*  I think for us a hobby is probably I mean, he's one of my all-time favorites [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7770.46s)]
*  It's not my favorite, but I think there's just a few guys like that like Henry [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7774.46s)]
*  Sohudo, you know that are just the best guys out there [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7778.46s)]
*  Just a few guys like that like Henry Sohudo, you know that are just like their next level coaches. Yeah, have this mindset [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7780.46s)]
*  They just that's the most important thing. I feel like it's not all about toughness and right I've had [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7787.46s)]
*  Coaches that tell me that oh well this guy never fought before why you gonna think that he's a good coach [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7793.9s)]
*  But you don't need to be a fighter or that some people are just better at understanding and breaking down fights in general then [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7798.34s)]
*  Having to go in there and fight some people some people can fight some of the great coaches like think about guys like [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7804.58s)]
*  Teddy Atlas wasn't known as a great boxer [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7810.1s)]
*  amazing coach, you know like this [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7813.06s)]
*  Emanuel Stewart wasn't known as a great boxer but amazing coach one of the greatest coaches ever. There's there's quite a few guys like that [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7815.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean Eric Nixik Mike Valley never fought before he's the same way and like I said, it's like [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7822.5s)]
*  Some people are better at teaching some people are better at breaking down film and seeing other guys weaknesses [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7830.02s)]
*  I know what Nixik was telling me that he would he used to be a football player and he would like bring that mindset [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7835.48s)]
*  That game plan mindset of what's the readiness if I know these guys are good at the pass? [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7840.96s)]
*  Well, we're gonna play pass defense and then fighters don't think like that for me when I fought Damien [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7845.28s)]
*  Maya, my goal is to stand a strike with you. I'm not gonna grapple with Damien [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7851.759999999999s)]
*  Maya when I'm fighting a wonderboy, I'm not gonna strike with wonderboy [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7854.96s)]
*  I'm gonna take him down right when I'm fighting these guys a certain way [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7857.599999999999s)]
*  I'm switching it up each time. Is John in Phoenix now? Is he training down there? [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7861.3s)]
*  He was I know he was down there [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7866.42s)]
*  He said he was down there for visiting because he was with Jackson Winkle John. They had a falling out [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7868.139999999999s)]
*  So he left and then I think he was doing stuff out of his garage [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7873.62s)]
*  But then now he was down with crazy so who don't training down there with them now, too [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7877.18s)]
*  I think I'm not sure if he's doing his full camp there, but I know he was doing some stuff there [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7881.34s)]
*  One thing he's done right is put that weight on slowly [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7884.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's the one thing he's done right because he's got accustomed to being [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7886.98s)]
*  255 pounds and walking around real big and heavy and he looks real big and heavy. He looks like a heavyweight [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7891.62s)]
*  He doesn't look like a light heavyweight that gained weight [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7896.74s)]
*  Yeah, he looks like a fucking heavyweight and I wonder who he's sparring with [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7899.219999999999s)]
*  because you know, there's this [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7904.139999999999s)]
*  Being in the gym and being who you are John Jones, you know [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7905.86s)]
*  There's people like want to see how he is and a million people trying to get an inside scoop of oh, how does he look? [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7908.179999999999s)]
*  How does he look and we really haven't heard anything like that [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7913.0599999999995s)]
*  From any of the little birds on somebody's shoulder or something like that [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7915.639999999999s)]
*  So I wonder if he's actually sparring with anybody training with anybody or if he just has that much loyal teammates that are not gonna [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7919.88s)]
*  Say a word about it until he wants to I don't know [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7925.92s)]
*  It's a good question because if he's gonna fight a guy like serial gone [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7928.5199999999995s)]
*  He really wants to get some movement some from some really top-flight kickboxers [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7931.62s)]
*  So like who does he have that he can work with like that? [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7935.24s)]
*  You know [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7938.0s)]
*  you really want [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7938.599999999999s)]
*  Serial is so good at mixing up the kicks and the knees and the punches and the combinations and he's so and he's so light [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7940.0s)]
*  Like the way stands on the outside [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7947.04s)]
*  like if you're gonna compete against a guy like that you got to get some similar looks and [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7948.76s)]
*  How many similar looks are there out there for a guy that's? [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7953.72s)]
*  245 pounds that could move like that moves like zero. Yeah, there's not a lot. Yeah interesting fight, but here's the problem [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7957.4800000000005s)]
*  Let's say John beats serial gone. Okay [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7965.36s)]
*  And then John fights steep a and John beats steep a then what? [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7969.1s)]
*  People are sleeping like Curtis blades [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7975.0199999999995s)]
*  I think he's one of the toughest guys there my immediate goal is to beat serial gone and to beat steep a me [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7976.62s)]
*  OCHI John Jones said after that will be in conversations with the UFC go to the UFC heavyweight [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=7982.42s)]

*  Yeah, it's generally they run out of time [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8709.86s)]
*  It's a time constraint because like they make a concession like say if there's [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8712.6s)]
*  Five fights on an undercard and the undercard has to take place within X amount of minutes [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8716.8s)]

*  When I'm not in camp probably like once every other week or something like that or when I'm feeling it sore, but now it's [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8824.84s)]
*  Being very careful and being smart with the way I'm treating my body [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8832.0s)]
*  it's like if one of the biggest things I learned from the the guys that from Habib's team is like [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8834.84s)]
*  They'll come in before practice and he'll be like he'll ask you like today's your heart's part. How do you feel mentally? [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8841.56s)]

*  Yeah, so he's like because interest because it's hard sparring because basically you're in a fight [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8853.92s)]
*  Yeah, you're gonna be in a fight and if you're not fully engaged and you're not fully ready for it [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8858.039999999999s)]
*  You're really not gonna gain anything and you're gonna hurt yourself [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8862.24s)]
*  And that's where injuries come from a little thing [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8865.439999999999s)]
*  So when he brought that up, I'm like, huh [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8867.519999999999s)]
*  I got figured you guys would be like tough it out tough it up man up [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8869.48s)]
*  Don't like my mentality was when I got there and I like don't be soft [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8872.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but they're very smart with it and it just shows you how smart they really are that even though they're beyond tough [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8876.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they know there's there's a certain little area that you really need to address [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8882.919999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and it was it was cool like I said, I'm like one of those guys where probably every single camp [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8887.08s)]
*  I'm over training and like I don't feel like I'm ready unless I'm over trained [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8892.779999999999s)]
*  so yeah, cuz you know you I work out twice and then I'll be like [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8896.88s)]
*  Three hours of doing nothing. I like man. I should do something. I need to be doing something right now [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8901.599999999999s)]
*  Let me go for a jog. Do you use like a heart rate monitor or anything to see? [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8905.4s)]
*  Resting heart rate you do whoops. Yeah. Yeah when I'm at a can I do I do whoops [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8910.48s)]
*  So can you tell from that whether or not you're over training and do you back off when you are it'll tell you know [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8913.92s)]
*  You'll get those days where it'll be like you're redlined or whatever. Mm-hmm [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8919.3s)]
*  But I'm still gonna train but not train as crazy hard, right? [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8924.4s)]
*  but for the most part when I'm even feeling tired and I'm like [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8927.92s)]
*  You're 90% recovery [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8931.66s)]
*  And I'm like I feel like trash but then immensely I'll be like, oh well the whoops is I'm okay [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8934.16s)]
*  I think that yeah, maybe maybe I'm okay. Maybe I'm just being soft mentally when [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8938.94s)]
*  My body feels terrible, but it's like the whoops tell me I'm okay something I'm just trusting it [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8945.02s)]
*  So that's all you use to make sure that you're not over trained [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8948.7s)]
*  You just yeah and you monitor like what it says about your heart rate and resting heart rate and all that jazz [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8951.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=8956.300000000001s)]

*  It was probably like [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9074.78s)]
*  two days of just like [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9076.460000000001s)]
*  Chilled and shivering and then just like body soreness, but like by like day three [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9079.02s)]
*  I was feeling okay, but like I was like in the best shape. I were like you're [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9082.980000000001s)]
*  You're healthy. Yeah, and then you work out at all while you had COVID [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9087.42s)]
*  It was like a depressing moment because my fight just got canceled because of it. Yeah, so that was like fudge this [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9091.220000000001s)]
*  I'm just like eating trash and laying there. Yeah, and then probably about like day four then I was like, all right [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9096.18s)]
*  I need to get up and reschedule this fight and then do something so like by day four [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9100.660000000002s)]
*  I was back to training regularly [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9104.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of guys who try to work through COVID work out through COVID while they had and they got fucked up [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9105.660000000002s)]
*  That's Hamsa. Yeah, Hamsa got fucked up because he's too tough too tough for his own good [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9111.02s)]
*  and while he was sick as a dog that motherfucker was still going to the gym and [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9116.5s)]
*  Doing rounds in the bag and working out like a beast and then he was throwing up blood. Yeah, I was hearing about that [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9120.42s)]
*  I was hearing that yeah, he's throwing up blood. I was like what? [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9125.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he was coughing up like his whole toilet bowl was filled with blood and the question with that is like [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9128.1s)]
*  What has that done to his lungs? [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9134.06s)]
*  Like does he have scarring on his lungs as are his lungs at full capacity because he was hospitalized more than once [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9136.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, COVID like it was a big deal because he's such a knucklehead in that regard [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9143.18s)]
*  Like he's so tough that he worked himself to the bone while he was sick with COVID and then got hospitalized [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9148.58s)]
*  I think twice. Wow. Yeah [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9155.5s)]
*  Yeah, and then the Cody Garbrand did the same thing [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9158.42s)]
*  Cody Garbrand had COVID kept working out kept training never got himself tested didn't find out [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9161.34s)]
*  He had COVID that the whole time until he went to Mike Tyson's [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9166.98s)]
*  Mike Tyson had him on a podcast and they it was during the pandemic. So they tested him like hey, man [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9170.18s)]
*  You got COVID and he's like, oh, that's what's been going on. He had COVID for fucking weeks [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9174.7s)]
*  Oh, wow, really working out work is still working out just too tough too tough for his own good [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9180.02s)]
*  So for a long time never got over COVID because he kept training [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9185.66s)]
*  That's crazy crazy [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9190.34s)]
*  But I mean for me [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9191.82s)]
*  Like I said it who knows if it wasn't my fight week if I would have just still continued on or if I ever got [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9193.14s)]
*  Even tested right like I would have figured it was like a regular normal cold. Well got over the chills when [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9197.58s)]
*  DC was training for steep a he got COVID in camp. Yeah and still fought and won. I [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9203.94s)]
*  Mean he worked work through it. Just work through COVID. You just gotta adjust [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9210.06s)]
*  Yeah, he adjusted and he just you know, steep a I mean DC brother is very smart. So he didn't train too hard [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9214.42s)]
*  Yeah, he just knew what his body was telling him and then got over it and kept training [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9220.14s)]
*  So he had like a few slow days where wasn't that wasn't pushing it very hard. But apparently Hamza just fuck [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9224.06s)]
*  So he just get in the gym [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9233.18s)]
*  Coughing up a storm while he's sick as fuck [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9235.22s)]
*  You know that's it was real bad for a lot of people that didn't take time off [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9237.54s)]
*  Yeah, didn't didn't take breaks because if you think you're too you're you're tough [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9242.1s)]
*  The problem with being tough is you are breaking down your immune system every time you work out hard [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9246.42s)]
*  So if you're sick already so immune systems compromised and then you're breaking your body down because you're tough because you're working out [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9252.300000000001s)]
*  Now the Cove it's really getting into your body. I mean that can happen with the flu that can happen with everything [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9258.42s)]
*  Yeah [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9263.380000000001s)]
*  and that was the hard part too is because you know, you're at a gym and you're wondering if you have a fight you're like [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9263.86s)]
*  Make sure you don't come to the gym if you have code make sure if you have any type of sentence and you didn't know [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9269.66s)]
*  To trust anybody and like you catch coven it's my fight week and I'm like looking who to blame [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9273.34s)]
*  I'm like, how do I did this somebody? How did I get kovat? I didn't do nothing else [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9277.94s)]
*  I didn't go nowhere. I just wasn't a gym and back home. Sometimes people have and they don't even know they have [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9280.58s)]
*  Yeah, my real estate lady. She had it and she didn't find out until she was going to a wedding [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9284.94s)]
*  So she had to get tested she was going like the Bahamas or some shit and they tested her and she's like I have covered [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9289.86s)]
*  You got kovat [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9295.98s)]
*  Let me get tested again. So she got tested again turns out she has kovat Wow and never felt anything [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9297.98s)]
*  Yeah felt any symptoms at all. Nothing. That was the being in Chicago [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9304.22s)]
*  Everybody would catch it at weddings like being a Middle Eastern. They have weddings every single Sunday [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9310.22s)]
*  My mom was still want to go to weddings. I'm like, you're not going to weddings [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9314.98s)]
*  Like we have to go to this person's wedding and I was like that's where people gonna catch it cuz like [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9317.66s)]
*  90% of people don't even know they have it and then all of a sudden the next week [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9321.46s)]
*  16 people from that wedding got it or 10 people from this wedding caught it and I was like [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9325.48s)]
*  Yeah, cuz you could kind of have it and just kind of feel just a little down [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9329.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, not think it's that big a deal and then you're giving it to everybody or there's people that had the antibodies and they didn't [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9333.0s)]
*  Realize like wait, I had it before it right. It doesn't make any sense [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9339.24s)]
*  Yeah weird times man [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9342.48s)]
*  But thank God the UFC kept those fights going on the apex put together that whole kovat bubble tested the shit out of everybody [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9344.0s)]
*  Made sure that everybody was clear before they got in the building. Yeah, it was beautiful man [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9349.839999999998s)]
*  I felt so privileged to be there during that time [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9354.04s)]
*  Like I remember thinking when I was there for the Tony Ferguson [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9356.92s)]
*  Justin gachey fight which was in Florida in the empty arena during kovat empty arena [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9360.68s)]
*  It was crazy, but I remember thinking to myself man [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9366.32s)]
*  I feel so fortunate that I get to be here because everything was shut down the whole country was shut down [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9369.0s)]
*  But yet here we are watching this fight [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9374.2s)]
*  Live with no audience and it's a fucking amazing fight and there's only like 10 people here watching it [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9377.6s)]
*  Does that change the way like you commentate it to because obviously the energy is different. I don't know man [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9383.14s)]
*  I don't think so. I think I think we did it the same way, but I tell you what though [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9387.619999999999s)]
*  I really do love fights at the apex center. Like what we're talking about cheeto in San Hagan [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9391.779999999999s)]
*  I'm really thinking about flying in for that just because I love seeing fights at that apex center man [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9396.5s)]
*  Yeah, I know people that rings not as good. I don't I think I wish they had the same full-size octagon there [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9401.56s)]
*  Yeah, I would I think they should scrap that little bitch ass octagon [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9408.119999999999s)]
*  Full-size octagon there because I think it should be uniform. I think the sport [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9411.66s)]
*  deserves a uniform size octagon, but [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9416.259999999998s)]
*  Man being there live is is exceptional when that's a little arena [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9419.06s)]
*  There's very few people there. You just feel special feels like real like real privilege to be able to be there for that [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9424.14s)]
*  Yeah, if you're in the audience, it's the best my family was there. They're like, dude. I'd never watch the fight [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9430.339999999998s)]
*  I never want to watch a fight not like this, right? [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9434.98s)]
*  Sitting courtside for like an NBA game or something because you hear guys breathing every you hear every little thing [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9437.5s)]
*  We hear the corner and everything it changes [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9442.42s)]
*  everything to and then you hear commentators to like when you're in the cage it's weird for you because you're like you hear in DC and [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9445.02s)]
*  Talk and I was like I wanted something to shut up. You don't know who's talking about it [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9451.699999999999s)]
*  So like that because you're in there and it changes the way you fight to a different type of energy. Yeah, sure [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9455.14s)]
*  I mean some guys hate it. They want that crowd like sugar Sean like he wants that crowd [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9460.9s)]
*  He wants to hear that roar, you know, some guys they like it some guys [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9465.94s)]
*  He like takes the pressure off of them. Yeah, and they're in that little place. No one there feels better feels easier lighter [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9470.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9476.1s)]
*  I had a [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9476.62s)]
*  teammate do it have his debut there last week and I told him it's gonna be better for you because [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9477.5s)]
*  There's not a lot of people there. You're not gonna feel like it's the same energy [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9481.7s)]
*  You gotta just have that mindset like it's in the gym [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9484.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because if you just change the the way you think about it changes everything not bad. It's my debut [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9486.54s)]
*  I this is the biggest stage the biggest [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9491.86s)]
*  Company the one I always wanted for the dream, but you're fighting with [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9494.26s)]
*  50 people in the crowd [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9498.140000000001s)]
*  So it feels like it's that normal bar that you're used to fighting in friggin Bufu, Indiana [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9499.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, how hard was the first debut for you the first fight in the UFC? How much different was it than anything else? [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9504.58s)]
*  for me was [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9511.86s)]
*  it was different because I took a short notice to and [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9513.58s)]
*  It was during Ramadan. So oh [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9516.62s)]
*  Yeah, so then they call me for that one [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9519.1s)]
*  But like I was 9-0 outside of the UFC and I was I just won the tight NFC belt and [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9520.900000000001s)]
*  I was still waiting for my shot. I was like dude, they're not giving me a shot [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9526.460000000001s)]
*  they're not giving me a shot and like I said, I've my coach seeing his footsteps and seeing him he never got a shot in the [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9529.140000000001s)]
*  UFC but [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9536.380000000001s)]
*  He was killing everybody. He was like on a ten fight finish streak of guys in the first round and [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9537.74s)]
*  Like they'd never call him and I was like, bro [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9542.34s)]
*  If he's finishing people like this and you never get a call like what makes you think I'm gonna get a call then they [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9544.02s)]
*  Call me during Ramadan sure notice I was like a couple weeks and it was Alan Jo band and I was like [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9547.7s)]
*  we have to take it so we took it and [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9552.539999999999s)]
*  It was International Fight Week 2 so that just changed everything too. Cuz it's like a lot more train during Ramadan [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9555.42s)]
*  How do you how did you organize it? [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9562.5s)]
*  Honestly, it's just basically I don't really change anything but the way I eat at night because I'm cutting weight at night [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9565.46s)]
*  So I have to make sure that [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9571.22s)]
*  Since I'm cutting weight in a camp I have to eat healthier so you can't drink water during the day [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9573.66s)]
*  No, you're not drinking water or no water during the day. Yes. I'll train in the morning at 1030 a.m [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9577.98s)]
*  No water, no water. So I'll train at 1030 and then I'll have another practice at 6 and then so it's 6 [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9583.22s)]
*  What you're wouldn't what time you're allowed to eat when the Sun goes out to eat? [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9589.779999999999s)]
*  Usually during those times it was during the sun was going down like 738 [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9593.619999999999s)]
*  So the moment the Sun goes down you that's when you can drink water and that's when you can eat food [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9598.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so you're training with no water. Yeah. Yeah, that's right with no water or food [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9603.34s)]
*  That's good. Do you get up early and eat? Yeah, so like our morning prayer is usually I like 430 a.m [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9609.740000000002s)]
*  So you have all the way up until that 430 a.m to eat or drink so I'll wake up probably [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9615.86s)]
*  4 o'clock 4 a.m, and then I'm treating it like I just had a weight cut [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9621.220000000001s)]
*  So I'm drinking a Pedialyte. I'm drinking getting my electrolytes and I'm making sure that I'm having good carbs that I'm gonna have [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9626.94s)]
*  So I'd be able to train so I'm eating white rice [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9632.38s)]
*  Eggs good protein so I just have to be very smart with what I'm eating and not just like junk [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9634.58s)]
*  Right a lot of people during Ramadan [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9639.699999999999s)]
*  They're gaining more weight because it's like you're not eating all day. You're not drinking all day [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9641.98s)]
*  Then it's time to break your fast. So you'll eat a little bit of dinner your stomach's already shrunk [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9645.699999999999s)]
*  So you're not that hungry, but then you're eating sweets sweets sweets [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9649.779999999999s)]
*  And that's the biggest thing for us is like your mom's making all these sweets during Ramadan you want to try this this and this [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9652.5s)]
*  So for me, it's just being way more disciplined during it and that's got to be hard to not drink water while you're training [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9658.3s)]
*  Yeah, I think it probably after a day for my body like gets used to it [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9663.86s)]
*  It just toughens up and I tell people like you never know how strong your body really is [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9668.26s)]
*  Until you push it and I think it just like evolves and it learns to keep doing it [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9672.58s)]
*  So so then so your second training session of the day [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9677.38s)]
*  Why don't you schedule that after it's dark out? [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9681.14s)]
*  I said I started doing that this camp because when I thought Luke a was there in Ramadan [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9683.26s)]
*  So my coach is like, hey, we're gonna adjust everything to that [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9687.18s)]
*  So my second training camp was always at 9 p.m. At night [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9689.9s)]
*  But for the Allen's no man fight was still like I don't care. I was wasn't even like I said [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9692.019999999999s)]
*  I wasn't thinking about the science of it or anything like that. I was like, let's tough it out [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9696.699999999999s)]
*  So I was still training twice a day and then so with the Luke a fight [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9700.019999999999s)]
*  Did you eat dinner first and then go to train? Yeah, I would eat dinner. Yeah, I'd eat dinner and then go train again at night [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9704.619999999999s)]
*  And all the guys were still they would adjust their schedule [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9711.06s)]
*  The whole team would come at like 9 30 p.m. And then they would come and train with me at that time [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9714.099999999999s)]
*  Well, that's nice. Yeah, did you did you like nap during the day? Like how did you take care of your days? [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9718.22s)]
*  Yeah, so you do your morning? [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9723.38s)]
*  I do my morning session whatever it was and then you know during Ramadan you try to be closer to God [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9724.699999999999s)]
*  so it's not like just starving yourself or [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9730.74s)]
*  Staying away from food and drink. It's like you want to get closer to God [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9733.66s)]
*  So you're trying to read the Quran you're trying to be more at the mosque whenever you can [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9737.14s)]
*  There's a night prayer that we we do and it's like a late night prayer that everybody goes to the mosque at the same time [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9740.42s)]
*  it's called that we are so a lot of it's just [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9745.58s)]
*  Doing as much as you can possible to be closer to God and be a better Muslim [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9749.3s)]
*  So during the day getting your mind off the fight where I'm not I think it helps me a lot of time too [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9753.06s)]
*  Because I'm not stressing about the fight because I'm trying to do be the best type of Muslim [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9757.3s)]
*  I can be so read the crown more you want to try to read the whole Quran during the month [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9762.279999999999s)]
*  Of Ramadan and you want to just bring yourself closer to that learn more about it learn more about the religion everything like that [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9766.58s)]
*  So if you had a title shot that took place during Ramadan, would you have any apprehension? [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9772.539999999999s)]
*  Like if you had your qualms, it was your choice [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9776.939999999999s)]
*  Would you rather have a fight outside of Ramadan or would you be fine getting a title shot during Ramadan? [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9779.38s)]
*  No, I mean, I would definitely want outside of it. It's it does compromise. It's it's hard. Yeah [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9785.9s)]
*  It's like it's not easy and it's I always tell myself like I'm not gonna do not another fight [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9791.22s)]
*  Again, like they call us this time to say no, but they when they call you with the main event fight [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9795.86s)]
*  Right against a guy that beat you before it's like I'm never gonna say yeah [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9799.94s)]
*  That's a bead ever fought during Ramadan. No [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9804.300000000001s)]
*  No, a lot of those a lot of them they refuse to they decide not to in there like they said they just focus [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9807.300000000001s)]
*  Strictly on the the religion aspect of it [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9814.34s)]
*  So like I said for me, I've done it outside of the UFC a lot of times and I fought a couple times outside of the [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9816.62s)]
*  Ramadan so I had like a game plan of what I was doing and a way of just toughen it out through it [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9821.980000000001s)]
*  So I think it just helped me out in general. Mm-hmm. But um, yeah back to the I mean the job and fight [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9828.300000000001s)]
*  International fight, I think we brought closer fighting that week too [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9835.62s)]
*  so just a lot of eyes a lot I just cool to see and [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9838.9s)]
*  I was never one of those guys beforehand that would like watch tape or break down film or anything like that [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9842.58s)]
*  It was just like we're not I know we're gonna we're gonna go in there. We're gonna beat him [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9847.82s)]
*  So going there was tough fight. We ended up losing a decision, but it was fight of the night [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9851.54s)]
*  So and it was like like I said, I'm a terrible loser. So I put him a head down [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9856.5s)]
*  I'm like I'm sad. I got I want to talk to nobody and then my coach [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9860.34s)]
*  It's time like bro, like the crowds going nuts [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9863.460000000001s)]
*  You had to feel the energy look at the crowd and brace still embrace the moment [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9865.74s)]
*  even though you lost and like I had so many fighters come up to me that day and it was like [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9869.26s)]
*  It was crazy because it was like max holly come to hey respect bro, Diego Sanchez. Hey, you're a beast [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9874.26s)]
*  You're a monster and is there guys like I looked up to him like love to watch fight [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9879.42s)]
*  But like I didn't care at all just cuz I lost so like but thinking back to those [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9882.58s)]
*  I wish I would have like been a better loser [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9886.58s)]
*  At that time cuz we won the $50,000 bonus too [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9889.099999999999s)]
*  And I said, I don't care man and me and Joe banner like at the hospital [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9891.539999999999s)]
*  He's like we won the bonus and I was like just crying like get away from me, dude [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9894.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's easy for him to say yeah [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9897.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9900.42s)]
*  So what kind of timeline are you on right now? [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9901.58s)]
*  Like does the UFC give you any indication of when they would schedule a fight for you? [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9904.7s)]
*  Or is a lot of the dependent upon the March 18th title fight [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9909.7s)]
*  That was the thing [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9914.980000000001s)]
*  I was trying to get on the March 18th card with them and I was trying to be on the same card with them and [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9915.820000000002s)]
*  Whether it was is that still possible? [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9920.34s)]
*  Is this depends on who they get close right? Yeah, it's like for me. I'm still training no matter what so like [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9923.5s)]
*  Yeah, the 17th. So I think it would be like eight weeks or something like that [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9929.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's 18th so you got you got two months [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9932.66s)]
*  Yeah, you know, so it would just be like you're hearing things of how does that going up to 185? Yeah [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9936.300000000001s)]
*  and you're trying to figure out what's happening to them that you're like, well, where's Colby at so I'm talking to my manager cuz [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9942.54s)]
*  Like I said, he manages me. He manages Gilbert. He manages respond [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9947.42s)]
*  So he's managing three of the top five guys up there [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9950.82s)]
*  So I'm like you have to have an idea of who they're gonna give me and he's like [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9953.880000000001s)]
*  We just have to wait [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9956.94s)]
*  We have to wait and see who they're offering who's ready at the time and I'm like, well, give me Masvidal [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9957.86s)]
*  Masvidal is on the three-fight loser. It doesn't make sense and I'm like, but he has the biggest name [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9962.060000000001s)]
*  He has the biggest name and he's a guy that's calling for the title fight and the champion's saying his name [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9966.7s)]
*  Yeah, so if the champion's saying his name it tells me that that's a name [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9971.82s)]
*  I have to beat to tell you that no you're not getting that fight because I can see Leon [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9975.300000000001s)]
*  Beating Usman if he beats him this time saying well, I defended my belt once now [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9978.82s)]
*  I get to call my shot and I want to fight Masvidal because he three-piece and stowed it to me [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9982.76s)]
*  Yeah, and you're like [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9987.86s)]
*  You're like it don't make sense [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9989.94s)]
*  But you have see money makes sense if money makes sense and that's that is a big money fight and there's a narrative there [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9991.380000000001s)]
*  I could see them making that fight. I could you know, it's uh, it's such a talent stack division man [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=9996.78s)]
*  That division is so filled with talent [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10002.54s)]
*  but it's it's rough too for yourself because [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10004.380000000001s)]
*  When Leon Edwards was we're at the place I'm at right now where he was on a fight Winni streak and the world was begging for [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10007.060000000001s)]
*  Him to get a fight and I'm like, I found way better guys in Leon Edwards. I have four [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10012.140000000001s)]
*  Top ten wins Leon Edwards has to be in one top ten guy in the division besides Usman and [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10017.02s)]
*  Kobe Coveton has no top ten wins in the division besides [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10023.34s)]
*  Masvidal who's who beat on a three fight losing streak [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10026.660000000002s)]
*  So how hard was it for you to the Leon Edwards fight get stopped because of an eye poke and then they don't give it back [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10028.86s)]
*  To you they don't run it back and Leon is saying I was winning that fight. We're moving on to the next [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10035.300000000001s)]
*  I was I was so bitter. I was salty [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10039.94s)]
*  Like I wanted a snap so bad cuz like in the cage I'm so sorry, bro [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10042.26s)]
*  And it's like I didn't commit the foul. He committed the foul. Yeah, I didn't do nothing [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10046.66s)]
*  I took a short notice rewarded for a foul and then now he's the champ. Yeah, and it crazy. I'm looking at it like [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10050.5s)]
*  It doesn't make any like make it make sense to me cuz I'm like I waited this long to get to this moment [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10059.14s)]

*  He was out for two years before that so you're still trying to figure out what's Leon Edwards gonna come [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10083.98s)]
*  So it's a reading out period in that first round, right? And I tell people it's not a 10-8 round [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10088.14s)]

*  If you could turn back this guy [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10125.62s)]
*  You'll show you are at the top of the food chain right now and you did and there's a few of those other guys out there [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10127.26s)]

*  It was like fighting downwards and he had everything to gain because he was undefeated. He beats me [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10146.52s)]
*  Well, dang look where he is now Sean Brady could be fighting for the title next [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10151.54s)]
*  But for me it was like if I beat him I'll move it sideways [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10154.82s)]
*  I'm not like I didn't really gain much from it. It was thank you did though [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SARIgtw_NiQ&t=10158.18s)]
