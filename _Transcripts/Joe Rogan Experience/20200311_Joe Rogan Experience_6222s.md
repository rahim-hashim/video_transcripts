**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 11, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUiUUCt_TWg)
*  Love not okay. No here. We go three two one
*  The champ is here. How are you sir? I'm good. I'm good. How are you sucker up about it closer?
*  Yeah, like a fist from your face all right is that good to see a brother what's happening?
*  Oh not for much my not for much just has it settled in that you're the champ. Oh, yeah
*  It'll feel real or yeah, yeah, it's it's settled in you know. I mean like it's weird
*  It's a hard to explain like I'm on the top of person that you know as soon as I'm home
*  I'm daddy on the regular bloke that everyone knew me ten years ago
*  But at the same time obviously you got you know the the media obligations and everything needs to be done
*  So it's you know it is different. You're gonna get recognized a little bit more on the street
*  But what is it like in Australia now the people get excited to see you know yeah, yeah, Australia
*  You know obviously that's where I'm from so that's a you know the sports are big especially where I'm locally like you know every
*  Time I fight literally out there in our city like stops. You know just to watch the what's the city?
*  Willing gong the gong say it again willing gong willing gong the gong
*  Just out for Sydney. Oh, okay. Yeah close, so you go to Sydney when you want to get crazy. Yeah, yeah
*  Not really I don't I don't do too much a
*  Partying and that except for a couple of days ago when we were in Vegas so Vegas got me got me good
*  Did it get you after is he won got me before and after?
*  So
*  So yeah, I mean I'm in real struggle straight, but I'm good well. We'll get you some water. We got water
*  I'm gonna electrolytes. Oh, yeah, we got some bring in some of those liquid IVs, but just bring the whole box of it in there
*  Oh, okay, yeah, look what IVs great. Have you ever tried that shit? Mm-hmm. Good. It's real good. All right. It's uh
*  Hydrates you twice as fast as regular water. It actually tastes good salt electrolytes all kind of shit
*  And we got this coffee trim it coffee yeah the Laird Hamilton superfood coffee
*  Yeah, I'm addicted to these little I'm addicted to the coffee, but I'm addicted to these fucking all right there
*  We go look at that rip one of them bad boys. Okay chuck it in your water. Oh, yeah, well now we're
*  Got to do that I guess so you know I mean there's becoming the champ and then there's becoming the champ the way you did
*  Because you beat the consensus greatest featherweight of all time in his prime. You know yeah, that's a
*  That's a big deal my friend exactly right, you know, it's it was huge, you know huge for me obviously
*  I love being the underdog as well
*  You know I have been in my last three fights and you know
*  I love sort of proving that the doubt is wrong
*  You know what I mean? And then obviously again to beat him like I did as well to you know out fighting
*  You know outstrike him and and stuff like that again. He's a great champion nothing but respect to him
*  But for me to go out there and and do it like that, you know, that's something I'm very proud of
*  Oh, you should be you should be proud of your whole run man
*  I mean you haven't been the UFC that long. Yeah, it was you know, I mean how many years you been in there now
*  Let's do I think it's a two and a bit or two to three. Oh, is it? Okay? Yeah
*  Yeah, but it feels like well since the Chad Mendes fight that's when people start really paying attention. That's where yeah
*  Things went quick. That's what people are. Holy shit. Well before that I wasn't even ranked right and that's why I wanted that phone
*  I know I think I was ranked tenth maybe sorry
*  So that's why I wanted that fight, you know
*  I knew if I took him on that'll get me straight to you know fifth rank and then that's why I wanted to call out
*  You know I'll go after that because I knew that'll put me in a position where I could you know fight for a title
*  Yeah, shoot for them ranks as I always said what is going on at City Kickboxing. You need to tell me man
*  Yeah, well, that's another thing that a lot of people don't realize I'm actually based in Wollongong like it
*  Yeah, but I go there for my camp, right? So I go there a lot and man
*  It's just one in New Zealand or do you guys have one in Australia? No, no, no, we go to New Zealand
*  How far is that flight about two hours two and a half hours? Yeah, what made you decide to make that trip?
*  Well, I've known the guys for a long time, you know Eugene easy even and Brad Riddell Brad Riddell was actually when I was in Thailand
*  You know talking with Ty yeah, I do a bit of training out there and he was a strike striking coach for a while
*  so I was working with him a fair bit and
*  You know, that's when they bring Eugene and Israel and that's when I started like and it got to know them and stuff like that
*  And just ever since then we've always you know sort of got along and now we're just you know
*  We're a part of a part of team in Joe Lopez is my head coach
*  But we go there, you know to City Kickboxing and train with the boys or every camp will go there
*  You know, we'll go there, you know a couple of times each camp
*  So I'll do like two three weeks get back to the family and train and then go back there again for the last couple of
*  Weeks and then I had head to my fight usually and where do you train when you're home?
*  I train a freestyle fighting gym. So that's a locally where I am
*  That's where I first my first day ever in the gym was at that gym. So that's still where I am today
*  That's awesome. So what made you need to make a shift though?
*  Well need a higher level of competition to train with well, yeah, that's always gonna be a big part, you know again
*  It's not a massive right where I am, you know, I mean we've got some some people but it's just you know
*  We're starting to get a team in that now
*  But that competitive sort of training partners is a big deal and my coach has always you know
*  Joe's always been a strong believer of you know training with so many different levels of you know styles
*  You know everything, you know coach great coach
*  That's not worried about you going to another camp and training is a great coach exactly right say and it works
*  You know like no surprises come fight time because I've seen so many different body types so many styles, you know
*  I put myself in that position every time like you know what I mean?
*  Like every every fight camp I am doing as many different bodies as I can. Yeah, just so I you know
*  There's no surprises come fight time. Is that your phone? Yeah, it was my phone
*  So
*  When did you start training what year do you start I started I've been doing it for about
*  Yeah, not even ten years nine years. So I actually started
*  MMA training as just a kid to keep fit while I was playing rugby league. So I was a
*  You know that was when I was 214 pounds. So that's something that uh,
*  Obviously when we when you when I'm fighting and you say 240 and it'll slow getting up
*  Your language you guys have that Australian language. Yeah things different. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  240 yeah exactly
*  214 yeah, but still is ridiculous. I'm a hundred percent, you know, I'm five foot six on a good day
*  You know, I mean give me a good stretch out do some yoga sessions
*  I might make five foot six, but you know what I mean?
*  It's just a yeah, I was a you know a lot bigger and I wanted to stay fit in between
*  Yeah in between a like sort of the season preseason. So that's why I went and started and just loved it ever since
*  So that was about yeah again nine years ago. So and how old you know?
*  31 there. Look at you fucking gorilla. Oh, yeah. There you go. See the size of you. Yeah, man Christ your 31
*  So head so you were you know early early 20s and no martial arts training at all before that
*  Um, I wrestled so I wrestled before even done rugby league. I wrestled for about
*  Probably a year. I can't even remember was you know, honestly, I was I've done it for about a year and
*  You know, I've done pretty good. It was something that I was actually pretty good at
*  But you know, I wanted to play football with my mates and I got over wearing the tights
*  You know wrestling and stuff like that. So, you know, it was just something that you know
*  I end up just playing football with a mate
*  So I sort of gave it up and I was actually pretty good at it
*  So we won the I'm on the nationals like, you know, obviously it's the wrestling is not as big in Australia as it is
*  Over here, but you know, I still won like the Australian Championship twice and stuff like that
*  But then I just I just gave it up and started to say yeah, so that's crazy. So you won the Australian Nationals twice?
*  Yes. Yeah, so that was a yeah that have him every year
*  And you'd only been training for a year, you know, we've done it for a year. Yeah, honestly
*  I remember we used to have a games night. We call this at a PCYC police boys club
*  It's just a local club
*  usually they'll have like games nights and they had wrestling there and
*  I just went there one time and the you know, the trainer was just like oh you should come in and do training because I was
*  Doing alright, so I just started doing it and then I was actually pretty good again
*  I was always like I literally, you know come out the the mother's womb like this
*  You know what I mean? So I've been there I've been this big since yeah
*  I've been this big or you know this I look this old luck for you know, since I was like 12
*  So I was always so I was always versing guys twice the size of me and you know what I mean?
*  So I was older much older as well and I used to do well
*  So that's why a lot of people, you know thought I was mad
*  You know when I gave that up because I was doing so good and then the same was a rugby league when they played rugby
*  League even people thought I was mad
*  Giving that up as well because they'll something was pretty good at as well
*  So what made you decide to make a switch to MMA professionally? Um, just my last year of football rugby league
*  We you know, we won the comp, you know, I got play over the match or I scored a 40-meter try
*  So you can imagine that guy running 40 meters
*  Yeah, so it was just a you know, it was just yeah a good year to finish on
*  You know, I had a couple of fights as well that year
*  So I was training at MMA and having a couple of fights while I was playing rugby league. Oh really?
*  Yes, during the season. Yeah. Yeah, so during the season you're having fights. Yes, we'd have a game and then you know a fight
*  Yeah, yeah, pretty much. Yeah. Yeah, so was there pretty full-on and still working still concrete. Really? Yeah
*  Yes Christ else pretty pretty full-on so a lot not happening, you know
*  And I guess that's probably where I get some of my fitness today as well
*  You know, I mean, I've just always been a bit of a gamer and you know
*  Just that's just something I've always done but maybe from back in them days as well
*  Well, I would imagine that just the the sheer tenacity and cardio that you would get from rugby rugby is a tough fucking sport
*  I mean, that's what I think Americans should play. I really do. I look at American football. I'm like take off the fucking
*  What's up with the shoulder pads and not honestly, I think it's safer. I think rugby safer. I don't think it's safe
*  It's obviously a very rough combat sport in a lot of I mean, it's kind of a comp
*  It's kind of like a team combat sport almost but you were at least
*  Not under the illusion that you're protected like American football players have been for so long with the helmets and the pads
*  And that's what's causing a lot of the brain trauma. Yeah with them hard helmets and yeah, I get what you mean
*  Slamming into each other, you know, yeah, it's a yeah
*  I guess I know I can see what you're saying there as well
*  But you know then again then you're looking at that, you know, someone running that you know, no no helmet as well
*  But I get what you're saying. I actually think
*  You know, I think you're right. I think you hit the nail and they do that
*  Well, I think they they've considered this but people are so accustomed to football helmets football pads
*  so the idea is to just make better helmets and better pads but
*  According to the guys who really study traumatic brain injury. That's not really gonna help because it's the impact. Yeah the head
*  the brain swashing around inside your skull that is just so
*  The
*  Amount of mass that you have these guys colliding into each other. It's almost unavoidable
*  Yeah, it's like what they actually when you're talking boxing and that as well and a lot of people, you know
*  Obviously we've got the smaller gloves, right?
*  But then the boxes they have more padding but it's just so many more strikes to the head
*  Yes day in day out and they reckon that's actually you know can be actually worse for you
*  Yeah, I imagine is and then also there's nothing else you can't you're not even allowed to clinch
*  They separate you you know, whereas an MMA if you get rocked you could at least protect yourself
*  You know, and if it goes to the ground you can hang on you could try to submit someone you can try to wrestle with
*  Them there's not a lot of options in boxing, you know
*  So what so you you did well in rugby and you had a couple of fights while you're playing rugby
*  What was it was it just a one-on-one aspect of it? Like what made you decide to focus entirely on that?
*  I've always loved martial arts. You always loved it and I love the fact that you know, you're in there by yourself
*  You know, I've always been a hard like worker
*  Yeah, so you could play the best game of your life in say rugby league and still lose. Yeah, you could do everything right, you know
*  Make thousands of meters whatever someone else fucks up. Well, yeah again, you know, you know, I don't want to put it out
*  Yeah, exactly. Right. That's sort of even even it could be vice versa. I could play a bad game
*  We could win but I love you know, the fact that I'm such a hard worker and you know
*  I'm always putting the hours in the gym
*  You know, I'm so dedicated this sport that so if I lose in that cage that's on me
*  Yeah, you know what I mean?
*  And I love that I love the fact that and if I am half arson it, you know in the gym
*  You're gonna see that come fight time and I've got no one else to blame but myself
*  So, you know, that's I've always loved that and again, I've just always loved martial arts even boxing UFC even, you know before I even started
*  You know training MMA of like, you know listen to music and I would you know
*  Picture myself winning the world title and you're you're so yeah, I've always loved I wasn't even training
*  You know, it's just something that I've always loved. I actually started watching it
*  Back when I think because we we had a box, you know
*  You get the the chips and you can watch whatever channel you want and the pay-per-view will probably shouldn't say that
*  But anyway, so the pay-per-view was on and I remember watching a Chuck Liddell
*  Sorry Tito Ortiz and Ken Shemrock that was the first time their first fight
*  so that was the first time I ever started watching like UFC and
*  And that's when I just absolutely started loving it
*  So I've always you know watched it and loved it and you know
*  Picture myself being in there and all that and I wasn't even trained at the time. That's it. Well Australians are tough as fuck
*  It's like it's a tough fucking place. There's something there are men. You know what I mean? There's a lot of I mean
*  I'm sure there's some pussies over there too, but they're men
*  You know what I mean? Like that's like one of the ways that people look at Australia. It's like it makes sense
*  Yeah, great combat sport athletes would come out of Australia. Yeah, exactly. I especially prison colony
*  Well, I will now yeah, I mean this really what you guys start
*  You know, especially uh, you know, why is your sign?
*  You know, obviously me being a been looking like this inside, you know since a young age, okay
*  Obviously you're gonna I'm not the type to brag that you know getting the fights and all that sort of stuff
*  That would happen and so I've always
*  Been known to fight and being able to fight type of thing
*  I've always had to sort of defend myself never been the one to start it
*  But yeah, those times where I had to finish it
*  But you know, it's just always something that I guess I've had enemy so I mean Australia you guys have John Wayne Parr
*  Jeff fanage you guys have had some great combat sports athletes come out of well, that's now it's UFC so big in in Australia
*  So we've always had as you're saying very talented guys, you know
*  We've got a lot of very good athletes over there, but they were always in your rugby leagues and AFL or whatever it is now
*  UFC's and MMA is getting so big that you're we're getting these athletes starting to you know train MMA and you're only gonna see it
*  Grow even more and we're gonna get a lot a lot more champions from our from our region
*  I'm sure have you ever trained with John Wayne Parr? I haven't I've met him. I met him at a UFC event
*  I think that's the only time I ever ever met him to be honest. He's actually got to get a hip replacement
*  Mmm, his hip fucked up from all his years of kickboxing his last fight. He retired on his last fight, which is a boxing match
*  Yeah, I'm Mandean. So that was a yeah blowout log it, you know, Monday can actually box really well to go and good
*  I mean, he's achieved a lot John Wayne Parr's a fucking savage. Oh, yeah, he's a straight-up savage
*  Mm-hmm. I mean that guy's I mean, he's been fighting Muay Thai since he was a teenager
*  Yeah, you know spend a lot of time in Thailand. I think I've watched him actually
*  This was a long time ago. This is when my cousin was a kickboxer and I went and watched him like this
*  Was I was very young. Oh, wow, and I hear I'm pretty sure John Wayne Parr that was I need to actually hit him up
*  I need to hit up my cousin
*  Was he was John Wayne Parr the main event of that cuz I remember watching and I'll connect you and John Wayne if you'd like
*  Yeah, yeah. All right. Yeah. Yeah, I appreciate that. Yeah sweet for sure
*  But again, like I've always been a fan of him too
*  Like but that when I got a little bit older, you know, but but yeah again
*  Like it's something that I've always been fascinated about all combat sports
*  So you decide to make the leap was it the rugby season was over and you're like, you know what I'm done
*  Yeah, well I was while I was fighting again my last year. I had a couple of fights and how many fights did you have?
*  And that was enough yeah, I think so, you know, I'm pretty competitive type of guy and the fact that you know
*  I wasn't at the highest level in rugby league yet, you know, it's 22 and you know at that that age
*  You know, usually, you know if you're not in you know
*  Not in our role as that's the highest if you're on then our role by like 22
*  You you pretty much yanking in like sort of sort of like that and that's how I was and I'm again
*  I'm competitive
*  So I was like, I don't know if I'm gonna make it up even though I was pretty good
*  You know made a lot of rep sides and stuff like that
*  But I was just not you know, I'm gonna take this on I reckon I can go the whole way and again
*  I've already pictured myself winning world titles and stuff like this and I even told people like before I even started that
*  I'm gonna be UFC champion one time and they're probably thinking we even getting this, you know
*  I'm sure a lot of people say that but I'm
*  Yeah, exactly to actually go out there and do it though. It's a it's pretty it's pretty cool
*  Yeah, I'm pretty amazing because I'm ever even having conversations with like friends and watching the UFC again
*  I wasn't even training and I remember saying I would have sounded cocky to be honest the way it would come out
*  I'm like I could do it. I reckon I can do it. How many fights have you had total?
*  20 and 1 20 and 21 21 and 21. I don't even know 20 and 1 I think when did you have your first loss?
*  That was my third fight or full fight. Oh, so it was right after you decided to go pro
*  I mean right after you decided to make that your life. Oh, no, it was actually because I had two amateur fights
*  Oh, I know that way before when I started so mostly the amateur fights were when you're doing rugby
*  Yes, I had four amateur fights and went pro
*  So I didn't have that that was against at the time, you know, Cory Nelson
*  He's named a little shadow for Cory Nelson, but he was a you know, he was a pound for pound number one
*  obviously was that welterweight this was and you know was very early in my career and I should not have took that far but win a
*  tournament and
*  He I had him first. I had the favorite straight up and again, it was in a division
*  I probably should never have been in right but you know, I took him on and you know, I don't know
*  I held my own but you know things didn't go well, but that was you know, we always talk about you know that really
*  Things really ask, you know, it went a lot better for me after that because I realized that he was too strong
*  So I started I thought I have to go, you know down or I have to start grappling as well
*  So that's where I actually started grappling after that. My coach was like, alright, you got controlled a bit too much in there
*  Let's just do jiu-jitsu for the next three four months or whatever. It is just straight jiu-jitsu. I had a jiu-jitsu comp and
*  You know, I'll just say again I was that's when I started dieting as well
*  But I was I remember doing that jiu-jitsu comp and I was on the podium
*  Getting the gold so I was on the first podium there on the second and third and they're still taller than me
*  So these these are the guys that you know, I'm so familiar
*  That's why now I fight a featherweight and I really do look at these even though they still tower over me because I'm still short
*  In my division, but I look at them and they're like, you know, I'm used to footy players big front rowers
*  right, you know props and and fighting middleweight and all these different divisions that you know, I look at these, you know featherweights
*  I'm just like they're puny compared to what I'm used to but that does make sense though
*  I mean you fighting at 170 is crazy
*  I mean that's 25 pounds heavier than what you're fighting at now and that was that pro and again fighting the top guys
*  So I thought I Anton's a fear before that and he was a UFC fighter as well in you know, welterweight
*  So what did you do to drop the weight down? And what do you walk around that now?
*  I'll walk around I'm a bit heavy after after because I obviously broke my hand and stuff like that
*  But you broke the hand the max. Yes, I did. Yeah, but I broke that in the max fight and which round
*  I'm not too sure I remember feeling and phone and be like, oh that hurt
*  I think from watching back the tape I wanted to watch back and see where I noticed it
*  I noticed in the fifth round. That's where I think it happened. Could you start seeing me?
*  Obviously on the offense. I was only using my left hand and stuff like that
*  Obviously if he comes at me as well, you know heat of the moment I'd throw it, you know
*  So that's right, but I think it was early in the fifth round. I
*  Think so you were walking around that now
*  Yeah, I'm about 78 kilograms. So what's that? That's over 170. So what's that 170 something I guess
*  That's heavy. I'm not usually I'm usually around. Yeah, maybe a couple kilos there less than that usually but so what comes off
*  I hold a lot of 165 ish
*  But yeah, I took holidays I went hard in it
*  You should celebrate man. That's it one time in your whole life. You get to be champ for the first time
*  Exactly right exactly right. This is your time. But again, I didn't have in the broken hand, you know
*  I want to train on the top of you know, try and be you know, I'm a professional
*  So I'll do what I can I was still doing as many things as I could in a strength condition building them legs
*  Being able to just throw, you know shitload of left hooks and jabs
*  So I should have a good left hook and jab come next fight. So I got to work a lot on that
*  Well, that's great. Now when you decided to die it down you were you were even heavier than you are now
*  What did you do to get your weight down from 214 to a manageable weight where you can make featherweight?
*  Yeah, it's obviously dieting is just absolute key
*  You know what? I mean even now like even when I trained so hard if you're not dieting well, the end the weight won't come off
*  So that's how but you know starting early
*  Again, you know, I used to I didn't know much, you know, I don't know what I know now, you know
*  Having dietitians and that I was never doing that
*  So I just literally ate next to nothing like and I'll train like I told you I was playing rugby league
*  You know, I was you know fighting training and then concrete and and you know when I when I was getting close to fights
*  I was eating next to nothing and yeah, like you just when I say nothing. It's sick a lot
*  Um, yeah, hundred percent, you know staph infections all the time and all that like it's it's a crucial like diet
*  You know, obviously the science to it all and we're now it's absolute game changer
*  So I just yeah pretty much lost my weight that way. So I used to be a little bit, you know bigger
*  Obviously from eating like that as well, you know, you you lose muscle you lose
*  You know, you're probably losing strength and everything like that. Obviously lose his health. Yeah, exactly right
*  So, you know, it probably makes me make 145 a bit easier now
*  But because I don't have it as much muscle as I did
*  But again, it wasn't healthy and it put me in again
*  I had to miss out fights from bad staph infections and you know, mr. Say and you know
*  Oh, you got a Jesus Christ. Yeah, I'm so scared of shit. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's terrifying. It rattles you
*  It does did it get you in there for what's that? So how long were you in the hospital for that?
*  Was oh, yeah, I was in the hospital the first day
*  but then they just had a nurse that come to your house every morning and night to give you everything and
*  So it was a pretty full-on and then obviously you know about that when I got I got cellulitis
*  after the Brazil fight with
*  Aldo well cellulitis is a form of staph. Yeah. Yep. Yep. So that got in my leg
*  So it was also a rattle man. So it's crazy luck. We always talk about how you know, MMA is such a rollercoaster ride
*  You know what? I mean so many highs and lows and that's a perfect example
*  You know you go over to Brazil and then beep
*  You know one of the greatest further weights of all time and then you get put in hospital and I was there for like a week
*  You know, you know, it was that was in Chile. So I was on my way home where it just absolutely rocked me
*  And I was struggling. I was really struggling. I really was it was a you know, I had like 40 plus degree
*  temperatures and and all that's
*  Yes, yeah. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, and
*  I'm just
*  Why the fuck don't we just go the rest of the world is on the cellular system? Yeah
*  Oh, yeah, that's what I'm trying to get today. I was like even a we're in the clothes. I end up dressing up
*  I was like, what is 40 Celsius? What is that in?
*  Let's guess I'm gonna say
*  104
*  Because whenever my Canadian friends say oh it's 40 degrees out like what the fuck does that mean?
*  That's cold as shit
*  Was it really? Oh good stuff myself
*  Kilos keep between kilos and Celsius. I have no idea what I'm talking about. Yeah
*  Well, I got a years I'm trying to keep up with that cuz obviously, you know, I'm all right now
*  I always say 145, you know, that's every time I 145 champ, you know, right?
*  So I'm a 214 when I'm talking about that, but again my Aussie accent everyone gets that wrong
*  I think it was just me. Yeah, right here. It's funny. You know, you always go on
*  Your social media and there's always like these things like, you know, they just roll on with like certain things like, you know
*  When I posted everyone will try and say I'm a New Zealander and like they just start like banter like that
*  And like and everyone's into each other on there
*  But there was one that the same as I got told that he was 240 and it's like they're just sort of trying to quote you
*  And they're like going and just keeps growing and growing and growing so you say 240
*  I can't distinguish that between 240 and 214 that accent. Yeah, 214
*  It's a cool fucking accent though. Australians are straight-up cool accent Australia and New Zealand. Those are both very cool accents
*  Some some accents are just ridiculous. They need to stop but you guys you got a cool accent. I appreciate that
*  Thank you. New Zealand's a dope place to be too, man. I want to go visit there and just the beauty of it all man
*  Yeah, green. It's man. I love that type of stuff. I'm all about, you know, the landscapes and all that type of stuff
*  But I'm never actually
*  In every time I'm in New Zealand, I'm in Auckland in the city. They're just training
*  So I never actually get to go see the place I did for the last event where the boys are 40 in Auckland
*  So look or Paul. Yeah. Yep. Yep. So I was there fight. Yeah. Yeah was here. That was unreal
*  What a fight. Yeah, man
*  That was good good fight for sure and I was there cuz I was in the way I was at a wedding the night before
*  So yeah the night before and that was five hours north so I had to drive five hours
*  I remember in Australia and that like it the UFC's in the morning
*  So I had to get up like three in the morning three thirty in the morning and then and drive all the way there to
*  Watch the fight. So while I was there for the wedding, I got to see a bit more, you know
*  I got to go in fishing like we and stuff like they say I love all that fishing in New Zealand
*  Yeah, so I was some of the best in the world. Yeah. Yeah, some beautiful spots up there
*  So it's good good drivers at least was a good drive on the word is in New Zealand when it's really good is during mice season
*  My cities. Yes. Okay ready for this
*  Yeah, so something happens where there's more seeds and when there's more seeds
*  There's more mice and when there's more mice the mice get into the water and when the mice get into the water the trout eat
*  The mice and so they catch these enormous trout that have just dozens of mice in their bellies
*  Yeah, right. You know all these sort of like
*  That's good, I know a lot this is actually a shout out to Jay Scott
*  Listen to the Jay Scott outdoors podcast where he's talking to it's a hunting and fishing podcast where they were talking about
*  They were talking to a guy who's a guide in New Zealand
*  Oh, okay, we're talking about you know, like when when's the best time to go over there?
*  They just have a enormous brown trout. All right over in New Zealand. Yeah, I've never done a trout fishing
*  I've done a lot of fishing that but never done like the freshwater fishing. That's fun
*  Yeah, they do fly fishing too, which is a little bit more skillful. Okay. Yeah
*  What am I giving that given that I thought I could fish a last time I I went fishing I went then we would try
*  To get Kings and we had to what do you call like when you're King salmon?
*  Yeah, like that you got to reel it in and like pull it up. Yeah jigging. Yeah. Yeah, I was useless at that
*  I thought I'm pretty coordinated, but oh, I just couldn't do it
*  I couldn't get it right know what it was, but I thought I could fish but you know
*  Maybe little you know small fish and that I'm all right up with but the big fish I need to need to work on that
*  Well, it's a skill like anything else and fishing is it's the guys are really good at it. They're consistently good at it
*  It's not a it's not an accident. Yeah, I do a lot more spear fishing. Yeah. Yes. That looks fun
*  Yeah, yeah, that's a you know, again, like as you know, like underwater. It's just a whole nother world
*  Yeah, you know what I mean? So it's a it's unreal. It really is it and I love it
*  So I go with a mate and he's like a professional spear fisherman and you know, he's a baloney diver
*  It does all that so he takes me to pretty crazy places like in the middle of the ocean
*  Just where there's a boy, you know, like a what you call it here just a you know a chain and there's like a you know
*  floaty boy we call them and
*  They're just there and then we'll go there fish off then like go for like dolphin fish and stuff like that
*  And yeah, you literally just see a chain that goes down to and it just disappears
*  It's pretty scary when you you know
*  I mean you're out there and sometimes you're on your way and you'll see a shark on the way over there and
*  Then you've got to jump in and you're like far out
*  Yeah, I've had friends that were hunters that got into spearfishing they say it's basically like hunting
*  Yeah, you're hunting underwater. Mmm, you know you're yeah and and also the element of holding your breath
*  Yeah, exactly. And so there's an athletic element to it. Yeah, and the fucking predators underwater
*  They're they're way scarier than predators on land because you can't get away
*  Thing you do. It's not our world. You know, I mean
*  It is it's it's unreal
*  So I get to watch him like, you know my mate Jack Levander and Lucey had to him as well
*  So I get to go down there and watch he can hold his breath for forever like five minutes
*  He'll be down there and like sometimes when it's murky, he'll go down and he'll just disappear and I start getting nervous
*  I'm like, oh and then I feel like I'm by myself
*  You know what I mean? And then you just you'll hear a shunk so you'll hear that made like, oh, yeah go
*  And then he'll just come up. I'm like, where is he?
*  And I'll see him come up like a hundred meters away and stuff like that. But you know, it's a it's unreal
*  It's it really is it's something that I think you should have you see
*  Need to get in there. Yeah, my friend Burt just got back
*  We've had Valentine Thomas on the podcast before and she does it basically professionally. Oh, okay. Yeah, she's she's always
*  Spear-phishing and her whole Instagram pull up her Instagram. Her Instagram is all like her spear for she was a lawyer
*  She was trying to be a lawyer in Montreal. Okay, she was like, what the fuck am I doing?
*  Like I don't want to do this. So now, you know against her family's wishes
*  She's out there jacking tuna and shit
*  But yeah her yeah, this is oh, there you go
*  Yeah, all of her Instagram is all dedicated to her catching wild fish. Oh far out and she's hot
*  Yeah, oh, yeah
*  I got the fucking spear in it. Oh, yeah. When did she get that?
*  Goddamn
*  That's huge is that a swordfish or a marlin that's a marlin. Yeah. Yeah, how do you even?
*  How does that even work? You know, I don't know. Yeah, I mean what?
*  Yeah, I just pull that fucker pull the trigger and then just lock your spear gun to the boat or something like that
*  I mean, that's some serious line on that thing. How do you get close to that? I caught one marlin once
*  It was a small marlin and it was like 70 pounds and it was so hard to pull in it was
*  it's kind of fucked up stories with my my oldest daughter and she was
*  I'll say she was 12 at the time or 13 and she was vegetarian because she loves animals
*  I'm like, let's go catch a fish. It'd be great
*  You know, you'll you'll catch a fish and you eat it and cuz she had like started eating like a little bit of meat
*  Yep, so I take her we catch a marlin five minutes into the trip
*  They pull it on board beat it to death with a club right in front of her
*  She's like, oh and it's big right?
*  Dog right there beating this thing with clubs. You see the look at her poor face. She was like, ooh
*  Oh
*  Well, welcome back to the it didn't die quick either it kept making
*  Flop around every now and then it would like come back to life a little bit and flop around
*  Did she go back to no?
*  Okay, it was a bit traumatic. Yeah, I could imagine likely. Yeah, but I love fishing man
*  It's just one of my favorite things to do. I love it
*  Yeah, well watch her cuz I get into the I do a bit of hunting and stuff myself
*  So, you know, I've watched a meat eater. I've watched
*  School in Australia. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah is a great place. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Shout out to my friend Adam Green tree
*  Yeah, yeah, I watched a bit of him yet. Oh, there you go. That came from Australia. All right. Oh, well, yeah, okay
*  Asiatic water buffalo and dangerous motherfuckers. Oh, yeah, they're big far out
*  I've never I've never never done like that top and they've been right up there. He'll take you don't go
*  Yeah, if he offers don't do it. Yeah, I don't drag me out. There's nothing
*  Exactly mosquitoes and crocodiles they drank water that they filtered out it still tasted like buffalo piss
*  Yeah, is the buffalo's piss in this water and all you do is just filter it like fuck you
*  Actually, it's funny what you say though, because I wanted to you know, I gave you that a kangaroo hat. Oh, is it there? Okay
*  There was a oh, there we go. Cheers
*  Yeah, I'd say so I don't know actually
*  There you go over there that's right in if I didn't live in North America Australia's where I live
*  Yeah, yeah, I love it there. I don't go there very much because the fucking flights too long. All right, yeah
*  He's like sad so
*  How do we fix that so it was I say with that I was gonna actually get you there even had a crocodile
*  Belts and stuff like that, but I wanted to actually get you a knife
*  Custom-made one we've like and I was gonna get like maybe crocodile skin up. I just
*  Time thank you next time next time. Hey, thank you very much for that. Look at all these fucking crocodiles
*  Oh shit, I'm actually what's that video? Yeah, look at this man. Fuck you
*  Green tree, this is probably in Australia. Oh, they're the Everglades. I don't know but what I mean, I couldn't know those are crocodiles, bro
*  That's not alligators. If you look at the their snouts, they're they're long and thin
*  crocodiles have a long thin
*  Snout whereas alligators have like a blunt snout. I mean I could be wrong, but I don't think I am
*  Yeah, those are crocodiles and the fact where you you could be going past little little pond or not even just a little
*  Puddle and there'll be a big crocs laying in it and stuff like that. This is so ridiculous. That's so ridiculous
*  So many it's so many I mean that's insane that doesn't even make sense
*  I don't know where that is. Maybe that's Africa, but if it's Australia fuck you Adam Green tree
*  Yeah, man, that's I don't think I don't think I could do that. That'll be I'll be near the snakes and all that when I was young
*  I used to be a pretty wild, you know, I mean like I'll do anything, you know, I'm not one give me on a
*  Snowboard, I'll try back flip off a cliff and you know cliff jumping and I'll do it all like I was a silly
*  But now that obviously I can't afford to get injured and having kids having kids that are really
*  Really does that for you offer doing some of that sort of stuff. So now we wait to scare up there
*  I wouldn't be able to you shouldn't we need you know, very important. You're very important
*  So your position now where you are the UFC champion. What is next? Is it a rematch with Max Holloway?
*  Look where right now we don't really have anything locked in obviously
*  I think they're waiting for clearances and stuff like that. But the hand clear now. Yeah. Yeah, so I've been many months ago
*  When was that was a December 15th, so yeah a few months
*  So it's a I just had like my first like wrestling sessions and grappling sessions. They held up well
*  So, you know, I told her my doc that and you know, he's a he's happy to they're more than happy for the June
*  Obviously, there's a perf card in June and yeah, so that's something that you know, give a pin in there anything
*  I've got a couple of screws. Yeah, so I've got a couple of screws in there
*  But and I've done a bit of a ligament damage as well
*  We don't know if that was before the fight or during the fight
*  But you know again, I'm back into training and it doesn't take me long to get fit and I'll try to do again
*  I'm professional try to keep training but nothing's locked in nothing's locked in. We haven't even really had that conversation yet
*  But all you know, everything's pointed to you know, perfect and even Max being the rematch, you know
*  That's what Dana White keeps bringing up, but we haven't had that conversation
*  I think for the division and for me, I think that that probably is still the biggest fight. It's a nice fight
*  Yeah, you got a main it's a big fight. There's nothing else that makes sense in the horizon. That's the thing
*  You know what I mean? We got so many or Tega is gonna fight Korean zombie and I don't what the fuck happened this weekend
*  We hear how he smacked Jay Park. I just missed that so I knew that that could have happened because
*  when
*  When oh, yeah Koreans on be done the done the interview like where they had the translator where all that sort of happened
*  I was like watching it
*  So I knew I knew what happened he and or Tega said that he was gonna slap him like he actually said this he was
*  Going to slap you when I see you or something like that
*  Why was he saying that because Jay Park was translating for for Korean zombie and supposedly he said things
*  That you know insulted or take it or take it in like it
*  So he said he was gonna but did he say things or did he translate?
*  Yeah, that's what a lot of people are saying
*  But I think you know, he didn't translate fully and then he just sort of had his opinion as well
*  Maybe so I think you know Jay Park might have just said that he was ducking duck and zombie when he got injured
*  How you know they were meant to fight and that happened?
*  So I think he said that himself as in I don't know it was weird. So I was away though
*  So it wasn't a way I was backstage with
*  We've easy, you know
*  so we go out there and and you know watch the boys and then we all huddled up and do our thing and then I
*  Went back and then it just happened. So was a
*  Joe my coach ends up telling me is like on I there was a fight just there and he didn't really know who it
*  Was but and then I got told by a couple of people and then I'm like, oh man
*  I bet you was that that Jay Park cuz I didn't know was it can't do that. Yeah, I can't smart
*  He's a tiny little guy. Yeah, yeah, you can't smack that guy even if you want to I mean
*  You want to point at him and get in his face and make him nervous. That's fine
*  Yeah, exactly, but you're a goddamn professional killer. Yeah, exactly. I mean Brian Ortega is a killer
*  Hmm can't be smacking some guy was a rapper. Yeah, that's it
*  If he wanted to get that fight again, I think it worked cuz there's
*  Anyway, wasn't he wasn't it scheduled?
*  I don't know if that was I don't know if that because it was scheduled and then it didn't happen
*  Ortega's gone through a series of pretty significant injuries. They just keep happening to her to her
*  Him and there's a bit as well. I don't know if that's happened
*  So I don't know but and oh that's that is what I heard. That's right. You're right
*  it was
*  Calvin catered Jeremy Stevens and Zabit in Ortega. Okay, those are the things that I heard but
*  After chance on Jung knocked out Frankie Edgar, who knows maybe they would make that fight now
*  But I don't want to reward people for smacking people, you know, I mean, they shouldn't make a fight just because he smacked Jay Park
*  Yeah, I'm hearing you so that's again
*  Like when you're talking about the division and lucky what's next for me? I was while I was injured
*  I thought there's so many people that are probably one fight away from a title shot
*  I believe you know, I mean you got your your or taggers is a bit, you know Korean zombie, you know
*  Yeah, I think any of them fought each other. Yeah and win. Yeah, I think they're clear number one
*  I think you know, I mean obviously people gonna always say, you know, you know
*  Max deserves that immediate rematch and things like and I understand that but I mean I think they could have had a you know
*  Case they to actually but no one did anything. So right now, you know, I'm not I'm not gonna wait around
*  Especially when there's an Aussie card, you know, and yeah, I think they've been talking to max
*  I don't even know again. We haven't even had that conversation. I just do my thing
*  I let my team do do theirs and I just do my thing and nothing's happened yet. It's a hot division
*  I mean that division is hot, you know, just like Calvin Cater who's another guy who's on the up. That's a dangerous guy
*  This is so much talent in that division. Yeah, it's an amazing division really
*  Yeah, 145 is one of the if you look at it stack divisions one more stack divisions in the sport
*  Yeah, I think so. Yeah for sure
*  It's a lot of killer a lot of killers in there and now they all got their eyes on me so
*  Well, I was so impressed with the fight you fought against max because for to fight your style for five rounds
*  You have to be in tremendous shape because you have a such an explosive style your style is so
*  Movement leg leg kick heavy and then power shots
*  I mean you're throwing so many power punches like just your sheer output and you're not touching people you're smashing
*  You know me it's like it's a very it's a very difficult style to maintain for five rounds. Yeah
*  Well, it is but you know again, I've always been a hard worker and we train hard. We definitely yeah, we we all
*  Putting putting out we are know if you've ever we call a workout. We do despite we call it spider
*  I was named after someone but yes spider
*  So it's just literally fight gone bad and it's just the hardest whatever you're fighting if it's a free rounder
*  You'll do the free rounds. It's a five round you do the five rounders like the hardest
*  Five minute rounds that you can think of and like they just put you you versus everyone like the atmosphere is absolutely crazy
*  And like if you just seen the workout you'd be like wow, you know that okay that that explains why he's fit
*  You know what? I mean, it's it's crazy
*  It really is so we put the hard yards in and you know, obviously to have a style like like that
*  Like you said, you know, you got to put the work in but again as you're saying like, you know, obviously
*  They're not just touching like there's a lot of big shots
*  But you know always try and break the rhythm so a lot of times I am you know
*  There will be a couple touch and then couple send them run through and I just try and mix it up really well
*  And I think that worked really well with max obviously gets real deep, but I won't get a do there might be rematch
*  So I can't give too much
*  What was the well you could give away this what was the game plan coming into that fight and was anything unusual for you?
*  Like when when you actually wound up fighting max was there anything once you actually in the octagon with him?
*  Was anything unusual not like everything pretty much went to how we thought it was gonna go
*  So that he made adjustments during that fight
*  We both were adjusting so, you know, I don't know if many people would have would have seen it
*  but even when it come to
*  Just a way like, you know, I'll go and then you'll try and counter and then he would be like pretend to counter then pull
*  Back then counter, you know, I mean, we'll sort of just having these little battles
*  But always leg kicks were gonna be a big part not just to hurt his leg
*  But just to really break his rhythm and you know and make him, you know, obviously loves that jab
*  And he stays pretty heavy on that front leg. Yes, and whether that's you know, making him adjust
*  You know his stance and and just putting him in a position that he's not comfortable
*  And he's been fighting forever in this style and it's been so effective for him
*  So, you know him even being a couple of inches back, you know, so he's not so heavy on that front leg
*  That just froze his whole rhythm up, you know
*  I mean and that's what a lot of people that it's funny a lot of people gonna go he's gonna make adjustments and he's gonna
*  Check the kicks and all that but you gotta remember he's a you know, he's a volume fighter
*  If he starts adjusting so much, you know, I mean starts worrying about all that then he can't stick to a game
*  That's been so successful for himself. So, uh, I don't know. I'm expecting the same thing
*  I'm expecting to go out there and do my thing
*  But again, you will mix it up, but I can't give too much away, right?
*  You saw some adjustments where he switched to South pod you guys anticipate that as well. Yeah. Yeah. We anticipated that
*  Yeah, so that was a again like you're gonna hit, you know smack the leg that many times I'm sure you know
*  Yeah, but again, it's just even though you know, he does switch stances a lot
*  So we're ready for that but I mean for him to actually do the whole round in in Southport
*  I think there was a third round or later in the second he sort of switched
*  But in the third he was like Southport for a while and that's where you know, I was probably my biggest round
*  It's very couple lots and then he tried to come back to orthodox
*  But you know, I just again I'm so so good a plan what's in front of me
*  So he did make adjustments and I adjust that again and it's just again
*  I think that goes back to training with so many different bodies and styles and you know
*  I mean, no surprises come for a time. That's how I look at it
*  Yeah, you mean you guys have a crazy crazy team. You really stop and think about it
*  You know Dan Hooker Israel Edsonia and you just alone and I'm sure you guys got a bunch of killers coming up, right?
*  I'm telling you there's some guys in you go there and you train and there's guys that do it as a hobby
*  they just train there as a hobby and
*  They could be in the UFC. I'm sure it's a blowout like it's always guys like that
*  You know, I just like jujitsu there's always a guy like why aren't you competing?
*  You know like you roll with them and they're like like elite black belts
*  There's always these guys that just really love it, but they don't feel like doing it for a living
*  Yeah, I mean it's it's a blowout
*  Look again
*  I've trained with a lot of people and I'll go there and I'll have this guy that
*  Hasn't even had amateur fighting he's giving me problems. You know what what's going on here? You know, but it's cool
*  Again, that's what makes a great gym. Yeah, I mean, it's not just the main stars
*  It's all the supporting talent that you have in the gym as well. Yeah. Yeah, well that's again
*  You know, even in our gym, you know, we've got a couple of guys even amateurs that fight
*  You know, we all treated the same, you know
*  I mean when when it's fight time if they're doing that spider workout
*  Everyone's here, you know, even when you're at city kickbox on or at our gym
*  Like, you know, the champions will still be there supporting the other guys that are doing their spider
*  You know what I mean? So everyone's it's just one big family sort of feel and like again, we're obviously a freestyle fighting gym
*  But we've been welcomed as a part of the family in it
*  And I think that's a big big part of you know, why why they're so successful as well just that sort of team camaraderie
*  You know what I mean? It's for sure. Yeah, I mean you see it when one of you guys fights. Yeah, everyone's there to support
*  It's a it's a big factor. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. So yeah again, you know, I mean, I just think it you know, obviously it's working
*  Well, we're doing good things and think therefore. Yeah, you see the kick balls of for no at the moment and
*  We'll just keep getting them wins up. What did you think about Adesanya versus your Romero? Yeah, it's a tricky one
*  You know what I mean? So obviously a lot of people are you know, and knocking it and obviously wasn't the most
*  You know wasn't so many exchanges and stuff like but I guess you've got to look at it
*  Why that happened and I think y'all, you know, obviously was just in there waiting for for easy to come in every time
*  You know easy did commit to something
*  He just come out like he literally was down to wait till you come in and I'm just gonna throw bombs
*  Obviously easy knows that so he's trying to touch him trying to get him to react and you know
*  You know waiting for him to explode and things that just didn't happen or so was it's just a tricky one, man
*  That's why a lot of people gonna say whatever but you never in there
*  You don't really know what it feels like to you actually in there and someone like Romero
*  He can take your head off like that. You know what I mean? So yeah, I didn't like the criticism of it
*  There's not much else out of son. You could have done and you well like I mean, I guess he's
*  He's selling that is he didn't do anything that he wouldn't fight him man to man, but that's not true
*  Because he didn't come forward
*  Like he's he's selling as if he was chasing Izzy and Izzy wasn't doing anything
*  But that's not what happened like Izzy was trying to get him to engage and he didn't want to engage
*  He was literally standing there at the beginning of the fight standing still which is kind of crazy
*  It was that was like a solid minute or something or standing still and then he would switch stances a little bit
*  True true. Yeah stand still to a couple little
*  But he's lulling you to sleep and you saw that when he did land a couple good left hands
*  When Izzy did try to connect when he did try to get close
*  Try bought into it a little bit and yo all through that fucking left hand. Yeah crazy how fast that guy is
*  Yeah, I mean so again, you know when you're just you can sense that as soon as I do commit to anything
*  He's just gonna come guns blazing. So obviously
*  You know fair enough
*  Obviously, there's gonna be a lot more opportunities if he started trying to do stuff as well
*  But the fact that he done nothing to only was just ready to explode it
*  It makes things a how it is, you know, I mean
*  I said you want to fight smart if you're trying to find smart as well
*  You know, and he should fight smart and I think he did fight smart. I think he did
*  I mean, this is what fighting is all about some fights like
*  John way Lee and Johnny on Jay check is super super exciting, but that styles those styles matched up
*  Yeah, I mean not every fight is super exciting Robert Whitaker fought yo well in a very exciting way
*  But I mean that's a bad way to fight with that guy
*  Yeah, yo, well, it's a fucking beast
*  Even just hitting him even like a I reckon easy from the leg kicks
*  No, obviously that would have been heard in a Romero, but it's probably hurting yourself kicking him. You know, I mean just solid rock
*  He's a solid good imagine front stuff and hidden just a brick. Well, it's what Rockhold said
*  He said every time he hit him and hurt him. Well, there you go. It's just
*  He's a freak man. And the fact is 42. It's like why in the fuck man?
*  Crazy yeah, I really felt like that was how is he how to fight him?
*  I really didn't think that he could fight him any other way
*  I mean I expected that use his length use his reach use his attributes stand the outside use the he's a higher level
*  Kickboxer use that you know, yeah and
*  Try to lure him into you know attacking and counter those those attacks, but it's one of those things where it's like
*  if you see like
*  When Tyron Woodley fought wonder boy kind of same thing a lot of people were saying all those are boring fights
*  Well, that's how you have to fight that guy. Yeah, exactly
*  That's how you fight him and you wait on him and you gotta remember, you know
*  I mean like obviously our let's just go there and let's just be you know, really exciting
*  But you lose everyone forgets about you everyone forgets about you
*  You know, they say you're gonna have that sort of especially if you champion you got it
*  You got to fight the fight that's gonna get you to win and you only have so many holes that can get punched in your card
*  Right those those punch holes are valuable and you let yourself get cracked when you didn't have to there's no need for that
*  Yeah, you should always fight smart. It's dangerous enough to fight smart hit and not get hit, you know
*  Look, yeah, that's a you know, that's that's how I believe as well. You know, that's it's just styles
*  It's just styles the way styles match up like here's another example Paulo Costa Paulo Costa and him that
*  Stylistically is gonna be fucking crazy
*  Cuz that guy that guy fought Romero the way Romero wanted someone to fight him and he still fucked him up
*  They didn't fuck him up. I shouldn't say that he still won and
*  even whether or not he won was
*  You know close. Yeah, it's close very close
*  I was some people saw it the other way, but I mean he hit Romero with everything but the kitchen sink
*  There's a there's a picture that I put on my Instagram of him head kicking Romero. I mean, it's I think
*  Yeah, and costas a knockout artist and he's he's shitting him right upside the head and like doesn't even budget
*  It's not even moving. Yeah. Well, you Romero has a huge scar down the back of his neck
*  And I think he's his neck is fused and I think that's part of one of the reasons why he kind of moves funny
*  Okay. Yeah, like this this photo. Oh, yeah
*  It even looks like he's went into that as well
*  I mean, it looks like he's ducking into it. He's catching it right in the face and nothing happened
*  That's a big dude kicking you in the head to his his neck. Oh, there's a big scar. It's really big
*  I've never seen a neck surgery scar. That's that large and it's he said he almost died
*  You know, he said he had some sort of serious neck injury and you know
*  I mean when you're a silver medalist in the Olympics in the Cuban national team the fucking wrestling practices
*  Those guys must have the wrestling
*  Actual matches that he's had I'm sure the wear and tear on the body's yeah unbelievable
*  I'll hundred percent but I reckon it's one of like wrestling's would be one of the hardest sports
*  It's one of the hardest man by far like you know
*  You obviously don't MMA you could do a lot of wrestling and yes just seeing them scramble
*  Like there's nothing like a scramble and just see the scrambles they have to train for yes
*  Imagine the training you got to do to be able to just do a two-minute scramble or something like that
*  It's just man. It's crazy. Yeah, and the test of wills and they're like they relish and being uncomfortable
*  You know in a lot of ways exactly right they enjoy it. They're like being really fucked up and uncomfortable
*  Well, that's that's a big part of our you know, you're gonna be comfortable
*  When things get uncomfortable, you know could have worded that better, but that's something that I'm all about
*  You know, I put myself in uncomfortable positions in the gym, you know day in day out or you know, obviously
*  Obviously you're gonna have structure to how you how you train a week
*  But I put myself there and then and how do you adapt to that?
*  How do you you know, how do you sort of go from there? So that's what again with that spider workout?
*  That's what you meant to do. You are gonna go to breaking point, right?
*  We put you there and I'll be in that position
*  But are you gonna shy away from it or you're just gonna get up and just do whatever you can
*  It might not be the best because you literally can't move
*  But it's how do you adapt to that that sort of system being in such an uncomfortable position?
*  So, you know if it gets there that you know
*  You're always gonna be able to at least push yourself at least get you to that whatever you need to do to win
*  that's where a great team and a great coach comes in handy that's where it really comes into play because a
*  Fighter, you know, especially some fighters. They want to be the hammer all the time. They don't want to be the nail
*  Yeah, they don't they want to be dominating in practice
*  They don't want to feel like you know
*  They're getting smothered and swarmed and they don't want to fuck with their confidence
*  But you have to trust in that process you have to and there's many many fighters who don't
*  They don't they train with guys who are not as good as them and everything goes great until it doesn't go great
*  Yeah, and then they're not used to that position exactly right? So I think I've I've always done that
*  I've always been even from the first day of doing MMA, you know
*  I mean, I'm I'm the type of person when you're always doing that when you always
*  Like putting yourself in uncomfortable positions and then you know, you always got to figure ways out
*  So if I'm first and heavyweights because that's a type of guy I'll train with heavyweights and you'll be losing but you know
*  You can just sit there and accept that all along to find a way to get up and you're constantly doing that
*  Over the 10 years you train and you know, that's where a lot of people like and how do you say fit and all that sort
*  Of stuff. I think it's just through so many years of putting myself in uncomfortable positions that
*  When when training does get tough, I'm still gonna go. I'm still gonna push myself
*  You know what I mean? I'm not gonna shy away from it and it'll make me you know who I am today
*  Yeah, I mean I just think there's such a value such a value in
*  Being able to deal with uncomfortable positions
*  Yeah, and that's I mean there's a lot of really talented really really good guys who don't do that
*  Hmm, but I think if the shit gets ugly
*  You're used to it. Well, you see it you see it in a lot of fights where people obviously get uncomfortable and and they just
*  It goes downhill for yeah, you see people mentally break. Yeah, it's it's such a crazy sport man
*  Yeah, definitely. Do you have a young a mental coach? I don't actually don't have a mental coach
*  I think it's something that I could definitely invest in and look into because again, this is as they say
*  You know so much mental in this and it really is physically and mentally
*  Draining so it's a but I think I'm I'm really good in them situations a bit quite honest
*  I mean like but obviously I can be better. I don't get like nervous before fights at all
*  Oh, yeah, I get more nervous when my teammates are fighting and all that will get nervous
*  But when I'm fighting on me, I really am I'm just I'm sweet. I'm having a laugh
*  I'm here with the coaches and the boys and you know
*  We even have a lot of people that work with the UFC and be like with my max fight
*  They're like you realize you're about to fight for a world title. Yeah. Good luck. You know what I mean?
*  That's just how I am. I'm pretty chill in their positions. It was a actual funny story. I don't really funny, but it was a
*  Cool, it was something he actually mentioned a bisming. So I end up doing a had a chat with him and I had pink headphones
*  so that's a like I had to wear him like when I've done like a interview with him and
*  So while I was there waiting to walk out he needed to go to the toilet in between
*  you know breaking between the fights and he stopped and he was like, oh I felt a bit awkward because
*  He's thinking I'm ruining this guy's mojo. He's about it, you know walk out and I'm like, oh you're good
*  Go to the toilet and he starts going and they're still trying to stay out of my way. I'm like, oh pink headphones
*  I'm just having a little laugh and he just had a laugh back and I remember on the pod on his podcast
*  He was talking about how you know
*  Like just the fact that I was able to be so chill in I'm about to walk out from my title fight
*  And that's just who I am. I just I just adapt to
*  Every situation. I feel like I'm pretty good in these situations
*  So I don't know if I need one, but I think I should still invest in mine
*  It's probably a good idea just to have one just to take it to another level exactly right exactly right
*  I think you can because I feel like I can do all right
*  But maybe there's so many things that we don't know. Yeah, and I think that that could help a lot
*  You know, so I'll look into that look into it. I'll look into it. Will you like that?
*  Look at his shirt. I looked into it. Oh look at that. Yes. Yeah, I did that on purpose
*  Were you um, were you like that in your first couple fights?
*  No, I wouldn't say I was you know, I think it again like I'm I'd like it when I was fighting
*  I'll always try and keep myself level
*  You know always doing that no matter whether I'm going in the interviews or whatever it is, you know, say if I'm a
*  About a fight. I'm just relaxed relaxed
*  Don't let it like, you know, don't let it take over you get the nerves or whatever it is
*  Or the anger or what it you know, some people get hyped up. I don't want to get how I want to be level-headed
*  I've got a game plan to stick to so I've always done that and because I've always done that in my fights
*  And in all situations, I really am like level luck when I when I fight
*  Sometimes it was hard for me to realize I want a world title because I'm so used to keeping myself so composed
*  That it was like it didn't happen. I won the world title
*  I was like there's a video of me backstage and I'm like looking at the bomb like far out like it's you know what I mean?
*  Like I you know, I mean I'll go on I even say something like that. I'm like going you're the fucking champ like wake up
*  You know what I mean? Like it's crazy. Yeah exactly. Like, you know, I'm just seeing they're still walking around just like nothing happens
*  That's probably a good way to be it is it does help me in my fights
*  It really does and that's how you can stick to a game plan when you're so composed and level-headed in there
*  So I believe it it works. It works for me. But yeah again, I wish I could be more excited about being a champ though
*  Maybe it's not a bad thing. I mean, maybe it's great to keep this mindset throughout your entire career
*  Yeah, when you retire you can go holy fuck. What did I do? Yeah
*  Like like the Vegas trip that's what it was. I was like what the what the hell did I do the last couple days?
*  Different. Yeah, so you say you hunt do you is wild game? Is that a part of your diet?
*  Is that a big part? Yeah, yeah, obviously, you know, I like to eat that
*  I love all that type of stuff and I've done it from a young age
*  I could my dad like so we used to you know
*  even go like hunting enough for goat and pigs and stuff like that and
*  You know, we'll even get the spit going like well while we're over there
*  Like we have to turn it with our hands. Yeah, like full like all taken. Yeah, so yeah, man
*  Yeah, I don't know to be honest when I'm in camp, I don't I can't get out there and stuff
*  I have but but I'm all for it. I love it
*  I love it
*  That's all I watch a lot of you and always see you with your gaming meats and all that and I love that
*  I love that top stuff. It's my favorite food. I love it. What's your favorite meat elk elk
*  Yeah, is that I've never I've never got to taste any of them. I wish you're around give you some
*  If you were in town, I'd give you some if you cook it. Well, sometimes we go when I fight in America
*  There's a lot of places that will have these types of I'm always in fight camp
*  You know what's hilarious? I weak if you get it if you're an American you get it at a restaurant
*  It comes from New Zealand. Oh really? Yeah, and then nuts. That's crazy. Yeah
*  They farm it like you can't sell wild game in America. You can't sell. Okay. Yeah
*  It's that's one of the reasons why it almost went extinct
*  Elk deer all these animals almost went extinct at the turn of the century the 20th century
*  Because they did what's called market hunting when there was no refrigerators back then
*  Shot everything and just served it to people and they didn't think about conservation at all
*  So they got white-tailed deer down to like a really low number
*  Elk were down to a really not mean they extirpated it from many many states where it used to be a
*  Game animal in many many states. It's not it's not there anymore far out. I think it's something crazy like
*  it's it's only in
*  10 to 20 percent of its native range where it used to be
*  But it's a they're very healthy populations in those states now Colorado is very healthy Montana
*  Wyoming Idaho Utah is where I go every year. It's a it's delicious meat though. Yeah, that's someone I
*  Don't know that boys is in
*  Yes, because I fought there and I wanted to like go and explore like cuz I knew it was a lot of big big hunting
*  Over there
*  So I was like I wanted at least go for a drive and see if I could see any luck in a deer or elk or whatever
*  It was but I didn't get a chance. I always got grizzlies. Yeah grizzlies
*  Stay in the car for
*  Yeah, I always got bears
*  I have friends that hunt in Idaho and they get real nervous when they shoot something
*  Oh, okay wolves to wolves and grizzlies like if yeah if you shoot and Wyoming does as well if you shoot an elk and so
*  Does Montana but if you shoot an elk in any of those states that have grizzlies
*  Very dangerous because usually it takes a couple trips to pack it out
*  Okay, like if you shoot an elk an elk is you know, probably eight nine hundred pounds
*  And
*  You're not gonna carry it all out. It's like you and your friend if you pack it out
*  Unless you have some four-wheel-drive
*  Vehicle that can get back to it or you have horses a lot of times they they use horses hunters use horses to pack out meat
*  Like they'll have a whole train of horses like five or six horses
*  No, they'll take the pack, you know put all the meat on distributed evenly on the horses and get out of there in one trip
*  Yeah, because if not, then you got to go back
*  Eight sent rolling
*  You gotta hope that motherfucker doesn't smell it because if they smell it they claim it
*  I have a buddy of mine who killed an elk and they came back to the carcass and it was buried
*  Oh fucking that happened to Adam Green tree that had him happen. Didn't he say that on his?
*  I think he saved it on his Instagram page. He shot an elk. I want to say he's buried
*  Yes, Grizzly came and buried it. That's what they do that what they dig a hole in their back decides theirs
*  Well for them digging a hole ain't shit, yeah, okay, it's like that's crumbling up a piece of paper
*  He's covered this fucking elk carcass here it is. All right, where was he at?
*  Does it say?
*  Give me some volume on this
*  Oh, it's a moose oh, this is Alaska
*  Yeah, yeah
*  I
*  Refresh this so we can hear all the words. Is it a good idea to get back there now? No, that's a terrible idea
*  Far out whole moose is buried. Yeah, that's my moose under there. Yeah might I be shitting myself right now?
*  Yeah, the other guy I don't like this
*  See the other problem is that grass look at the grass that grass is like five feet high
*  You can't even see the motherfucker if it's coming. Yeah, that's what's scary that thing could be 30 yards away
*  Just watching them walk up on the shit
*  It's a pretty shitty position
*  So he got most of the meat out of there with the bear had taken some of it, but they had to dig it up and
*  Far out. Yeah, my desk area. Oh so scary
*  Oh
*  So scary Lisa even crocodiles at least you sort of I know to sort of stay away from the water or something exactly
*  Yeah, well, that's the problem is it it had decided that that moose was his you know
*  and they're
*  Yeah, they're all over it's a big fucking animal man. Is that another video is it two videos? What's this?
*  I'm trying to get it out of there
*  Man hold up already been gone. We take that take the hit let's just go. Oh
*  You want that meat though?
*  What's today oh I get you so they've already cut it all up and had in bags
*  So there's what I was saying, okay, they cut it up and they were carrying it out. Okay. Yeah one step at a time
*  So right. Yeah, so say if you and I shot a moose and we were out there
*  You know, we both put like a hundred pounds on our back and we hike out and everything would be
*  Meat would be already packed up and yes, okay
*  I thought they would take a bit cut it they put it in these
*  Game bags and then they let it sit there. So they've been on meaty. Yeah, exactly
*  So when they went back it had all been buried
*  It's a scary situation of being yeah, obviously we got a lot of snakes and all that
*  So that's why a lot of people like going, you know, fuck Australia go there
*  Yeah, it's weird like you do literally, you know
*  there are a lot of snakes and spiders and stuff like that, but now the other even that mate that I talked to you about
*  That the spear fisherman. He's just like man. He's like a
*  Steve Irwin like he's just you know in
*  Everything everything he does. He could I've seen him like run. He was on like a swing jumped off and then realized there was a
*  Octopus in the water just goes there jumps in dives in some I've got like just don't even know how you catch it goes in
*  Boom pulls this big octopus out and just situations like that man. I've seen him even other times
*  We're walking you see a lizard jump in the water
*  He's just thought then like his head and arm goes in boom pulls out this big
*  Just you know, there's just crazy things connected to the wildlife
*  so then obviously we snakes on all that sort of stuff and he's catching the snakes and
*  Octopus will fuck you up too man. They have that beak. They scare me man. They scare me. Yeah
*  Well, they even just them sticking to you. I feel like plus they're smart as shit. Yeah
*  Oh, yeah, man. I've seen some mad videos of them, but they only live like a couple of years
*  Yeah, I think an octopus is life. How long Jamie Shiginson? It's like max two years
*  Maybe average about a year maybe average two. It's what we looked at. We've looked at a couple times
*  That's why they don't take over the world because they're like two-year-old babies, but they're fucking smart as shit, man
*  Open up jars and shit
*  I've watched them videos and when they they obviously know their size so they put a tentacle fruit and they're like, oh, yeah
*  I can fit for that. It's like this
*  Yeah, and the big octopus like and they only press as long as the big can go through
*  Mm-hmm whole body can go through. Yeah, and you watch them do that. You're like what?
*  Look, yeah crazy three to five. It says
*  Giant octopus three to five years and then die of old age small
*  They're delicious
*  Yes
*  So I used to feel bad that I was eating them
*  But then I found out they only live five years Mike what am I cutting a year out of your life?
*  You know, yeah, so I'm saying I was saying in the in the obviously in the wild in Australia
*  We've seen some pretty crazy thing. Maybe listen as you know, like the the hunting stories are always some crazy stories
*  Well, you have a crazy place too because so much of your wildlife is invasive
*  So much of your wildlife has been introduced because the people that put your ancestors there
*  They decided they were trying to turn that place into some wild hunting habitats
*  They brought over stags and red deer and all these animals that thrive over there. They're all invasive species
*  Yeah, I mean we got I'll make the deer there
*  They're everywhere now like so where I live is on the beach coastline there and like we've got mountains and they're just
*  Deer everywhere like they just walk in people's yards and stuff like that
*  And I've seen the photos of them on the beaches and stuff like that just yeah, where people if you need me
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, like my friend Adam
*  I mean, he's all he eats his wild game and he you can hunt in so many different places over there
*  Hmm. Yeah for sure and they treat them like like a red deer over there is it's like a rodent or a pest
*  All right. Yeah, so many of that's what I mean the deers especially we are they they're just the thousands of them or millions of them
*  Yeah, just everywhere everywhere you go there and just any open paddock in the afternoon and they'll be you'll see like heard them
*  New Zealand's the same way right? Yeah, they brought in all those animals and just left them there and now there's no predators
*  Yeah, luckily, there's no predators, but they did fuck up in Australia and bring over some predators
*  They brought over cats and all right wild cats in Australia are a big problem. They kill everything
*  they've devastated ground nesting birds and all sorts of different wildlife and
*  It's one of the weirder things about bow hunting in Australia is that they'll hold up cats
*  Like like something they killed. Okay, let's take a house cat
*  Oh, they're holding up a house cat and smile like look I got him
*  Yeah, like what the fuck the same way people would hear with a coyote
*  Okay, hunters kill as many coyotes as they can over here
*  Okay, coyotes kill fucking cats and dogs and they kill the chickens and they've killed all my fucking chickens
*  A bunch of chickens they killed nine of them at one time
*  Yeah, I've had them a bunch they killed them slowly and then they got them all at once
*  We had a fire out here and the fire burnt down my chicken coop
*  So I put him in a smaller chicken coop
*  Okay, and the coyotes tore open the chicken coop and killed my nine remaining chickens all in one night
*  Feathers everywhere. Oh, they're monsters. They're clever. They're really interesting animals
*  Okay, part of me admires them because they're really they're really smart little fuckers
*  They're really smart and they're sneaky like they'll they'll trick a dog into chasing after them and then a couple other coyotes
*  You'll be waiting and they'll jump the dog and kill it. Oh really? Yeah far out. Yeah, they're easy
*  What is this here? Australia's deadly serious about killing millions of cats see that guy holding a fucking cat
*  Yeah, feral felines are driving the country's native species to extinction now
*  A massive calling is underway to preserve what's left of the wild someone who didn't understand wildlife
*  Introduced cats there to deal with other small animals
*  Because I think they had brought they brought something else over there that was causing problems
*  I think rabbits I think that's what it was
*  I think they brought rabbits over there and the rabbits were fucking everything up. So like hmm
*  What can we do rabbits are eating all those? Oh, we'll bring cats though
*  And they just created a mess. So they're they're trying they literally would like all wild cats to be extinct
*  Yeah, you do you do see a fair bit of them out there
*  Yeah
*  Well cats in America kill billions with a B billions of birds and mammals every year
*  Yeah, every year they kill billions of birds and mammals
*  That's it. That's why I know a lot of the farmers and that they obviously can't you know, even in my again my mate
*  Like is you just you know, they kill so many native birds and all that sort of stuff
*  And that's why he's not a big fan of him. But yeah. Yeah, it's just yeah again
*  It's bloody crazy they get some of them get big as well. I've seen photos of
*  Like they look like a house cat, but then they're just like huge
*  They hold them like this and almost touching the ground. You're like what?
*  Good and I've seen some ones that were black so they look like a pamphlet or something like well
*  That's a pamphlet. I'm not just a cat is all far out 28 pound house
*  It says the number of fluctuates from between 2 to 6 million depending on the weather
*  Mount of cats in Australia. Yeah, holy shit dropping
*  Poisoned sausage out of the air
*  To kill the cat. Yeah. Oh, well, that's gonna fuck everything else up because other things gonna eat the poison sausage
*  What in the hell man? Why don't they ever figure that out? You can't just do that
*  They estimated over over two hundred thousand cats were killed in the first 12 months after the plan was announced
*  Dropping lethal sausages from the sky is only part of the country's efforts to eradicate the feral cats
*  Yeah, they
*  Some places they have a bounty on them. Like if you shoot cats, they'll give you money. Oh really? Yeah
*  Yeah, they have that with wolves in some places too
*  Shoot wolves. They'll give you money because the wolves are fucking up so much wildlife and my dog get pretty like you said with the coyotes
*  And all that like even just and then the bears and all that sort of stuff
*  Hunting some scary stuff. It can get real. Yeah, because you're out there. You're putting yourself in the food chain
*  Yeah, well I said ours is obviously we've got a lot of poisonous things and little things that'll get you but then over there over here
*  Just seems like everything's big that'll just fuck you up
*  Well Australia is crazy too because most people live on the outside. Yeah, the insides just madness. Yep
*  I'll make that they're a bit different as well
*  I don't know if what's lucky but when you go out west and all that and you know, they're just a bread a bit different
*  So I'll go like we'll go out there and even just driving on the roads and yeah
*  Sit there like we wave at someone and you know the Westies they'll just be like
*  They just lift the finger up as in that's that's a hello. They're just they're just bread so much different over there
*  It's crazy the people in the bush. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what we call Westies
*  Sorry, that guy the Westies so they're spooky folks that live out in those weird places
*  What we got you know, we talked about that
*  I think you just said it to the number of birds that they kill is like at least in America
*  It says it's estimated 1.3 to 4 billion birds a year
*  Yeah, they add mammals to that number which was like reptiles and other things
*  6.3 to 22.3 billion mammals are killed every year by cats
*  That's way more than people have been alive ever the more than all the people ever
*  Crazy every year these little fucks far. Plus they're cute you little part you pet him they purr
*  Little murderers, it's amazing
*  Stats a crazy status that Australia and that said just by the way in the United States. It's even more
*  Look at that
*  Wow in addition to mammals cats kill an addition an estimate 377 million birds and
*  649 million reptiles every year in Australia. That's fucking nuts far out
*  Yeah, and some asshole brought him over there not that long ago. I think they brought him over in the 1800s
*  I've heard like a couple of different like cases where that they bring people in and notice us
*  Yeah, and then just went backwards for them. Yeah, you can't just bring things places. You can't just do it
*  Yeah, you know was actually predators all the cane toads. So
*  They got introduced for can't man. I know you might have to get this one, but they bring him in and now they're just a
*  Complete like pests like they like up those are big fuckers. Yeah, they're big
*  Bring them here for probably for some other stupid reason I can't remember yeah
*  Beatles in the sugar fields. Yeah, there you go. Too many Beatles. What do you want to do?
*  Yeah, bring them and now they're like a massive problem. You know what I mean? So
*  1935 these dipshits
*  They're brought to Australia from Hawaii with the intention of controlling the cane beetle in the sugar cane fields in North, Queensland
*  Cane beetles live on the high upper stalks of the cane plant cane toads can't jump up that far
*  So they barely had any impact these fucking idiots they didn't know jack shit in 1935 they couldn't Wikipedia shit
*  Right some some idiots like you got to justify your job
*  Toads we're gonna bring toads
*  Have we talked about the for pest campaign that happened? Whoa look at the size of that prick look at the one in the middle
*  Click on that one in the middle the middle
*  Look at that
*  Look at those fucks. Yeah, man
*  Jesus Christ well they started off though. They're all up
*  They're up north in like Queensland, and then they just now they're now they're all in a New South Wales
*  And they're just expanded it's just like gonna take over Australia. I don't even know actually this is this is stats arrived
*  knew about like eight years ago, so it's probably
*  Quadripled by now or like they probably have covered the oil and even know what do they use to kill the cane toads?
*  They're gonna bring in birds
*  Have we talked about the for pest campaign
*  That's like a ancient not ancient but like it's a historical event that happened that led to like the death of 35 million people
*  in China
*  No, yeah, they had a sparrow problem or swallows whichever would small bird mm-hmm
*  So there was there an annoyance that they allowed people to kill them
*  They're like bang pots and pans to get rid of them that worked to get rid of them
*  But then all of the bugs then ate all the rice fields that led to a famine that led to
*  25 to 35 million people dying oh
*  Yes, they would have been better off with the birds
*  Yeah, it's like a whole it's a historical event that people need to keep in mind when these things happen that
*  There's a very sensitive ecosystem. Yeah, was that a 1935 as well
*  Nobody learned
*  Yeah, it's like I don't know man. I don't know how they're gonna get rid of those frogs. Do they have an idea?
*  I don't know. I mean, I don't know too much. I just remember hearing that stats off all I'd throw it out there
*  But I don't know this buddy
*  I think I mean I remember seeing videos of and there was like just the floors absolutely covered of
*  In certain spots up in Queensland like absolutely covered like actually it was in the Simpsons wonder was it
*  I swear was the Simpsons episode. Yeah
*  And what do I would have called him shaz wass or something like that?
*  I really have someone come they beat him they like they pull up the sticks and be
*  Yeah, yeah, something like that. Yeah, the four pest thing was a couple years later. It's 1958 to 1962. Hmm interesting
*  So they didn't learn from 35. Well, maybe those toads taste good. Maybe they started eating toads
*  I think frog legs are delicious. Are they poisonous? No
*  That's why I think they're big but maybe not maybe no cane toads poisonous
*  We'll find out here
*  Have you ever had frog legs?
*  Yes, I have when they're cooked well, they're good. Where did I have that? I did have that and I was actually what was it?
*  It was actually a mixture of I thought chicken and fish the ones I had yeah
*  Will you reckon oh, yeah, but they always say everything poison but no one's died from that
*  They have boiled toad eggs, oh boy toad eggs
*  So their vet they have some sort of poison says yeah, they're canes that has poison glands through their whole life cycle
*  Mmm depends on when it's killed depends on what about for animals. It kills. It's bad for animals dogs
*  Oh, well, that's great. That means you can't eat them. That means these fuckers. They're running around making sure that predators don't eat them
*  No, but they're probably what a dumb animal to bring over there to kill beetles you fucking assholes
*  He should find that guy from 1935 and kick his ass. We go back in time. Like what were you thinking man?
*  What a dumb move bring over a poison toad that no one can eat
*  Was it so was the full bugs that literally for bugs that's a crazy
*  Yeah, and the fact that it's poisonous which not venomous poisonous which means if they eat it they die
*  So these predators if you brought over a bunch of fucking jackals or something to go eat the frogs
*  Yeah, or the toads they would wind up dying
*  Cane toads. Oh, they do have venom secreting poison glands known as
*  paratoid glands or
*  swellings on each shoulder where poisons released if they are threatened when they're threatened if
*  Ingested the venom can cause rapid heartbeat excessive salvation
*  Convulsions and paralysis and can result in death for many native animals great
*  So you can't even fucking kill them with predators god, it's well, maybe we get the cats to eat the cane toads
*  Maybe that's the move. I swear like I could be wrong like the mercy
*  Look at this the most humane way to kill cane toads to put them in the freezer alive
*  Humane
*  That's the most humane
*  Well, I think I remember getting told like that back in the day like you had to kill him if you seen him or something
*  I think that was a film if you can the month's popular method was used to kill millions of poisonous pets until it was banned
*  20 years ago because animal ethics committees considered it inhumane. Oh you fucks
*  It's all those fucking animal rights people. They ruin everything. What about our rights? Huh? You got poison toads everywhere assholes
*  How do you get rid of them? What does it say remove toad temptations and make your home a
*  Cane toad free zone you need a sign you decide hey, we're a cane toad free zone here
*  Cover or bring pet food in at night as it attracts cane toads remove standing water. Oh great. How you gonna do that?
*  What's what about ponds? What about puddles remove rubbish and other degrees debris?
*  So cane toad cannot shelter under it during the day keep your outside lights off when not needed
*  Keep toads out by creating a barrier
*  Far out far out indeed. I don't know about that
*  Hire people hire people to kill him give them a lot make it valuable to kill him. I'm telling you
*  I think it was for a bit. I think they'll honestly I remember if you say one
*  I think you you had to I don't know supposed to kill him. Yeah, I don't know could be wrong
*  Maybe I just heard that from someone and I'm running with it good archery practice
*  If you had a lot of arrows, you know, cuz it's not a big target. It's a good thing to shoot at
*  Fucking crazy assholes bring over fucking poisonous toads estimated over 200 million
*  That's so many toads
*  200 million toads
*  Jesus Australia. Yeah, I don't know about that one
*  Crazy. Yeah, so what do you eat during camp?
*  Well, actually I got a dietitian on board now. So he does a few a few of us
*  You know, he does easy and that as well. Do you get meal prep like like?
*  No, I used to get that but now I just say he just gives me a sort of game plan to go with
*  I'm sorry, not game plan a diet plan. Yeah meal plan and you know, I just yeah, obviously I got options and stuff
*  Like that and it's a game changer man
*  It really is like I said from what I used to eat to now
*  I'm talking even just a couple of couple of fights ago
*  Like you know what I mean? I was a do my own thing and you know the fight week
*  I would literally just eat chicken and nuts and this wasn't that long guys in you know
*  I was ranked and I was just eating like chicken and nuts and just to plead myself so much
*  Oh, don't get me wrong. I would end up pretty light. But I mean, it was not it was not good for the body
*  That's for sure. So when will you start?
*  So like say if you have a fight and it's eight weeks out when we start the dieting process to try to lose weight and when
*  When are you just eating just for health? Yeah. Well, I'm I'm always trying to all year round
*  I try except for the last few months all year round. I'm trying to eat, you know reasonably good
*  You know during the week and then the weekends
*  I'll sort of just do whatever and I still do that all the way through to my fight till about two weeks is my last
*  You know cheat meal as people would say like, you know my last time I actually do that
*  But you know, it's just again when I'm in care, I don't know if my body just knows obviously the science still but sometimes
*  I swear I'm eating the same and as I get closer to fight
*  Maybe I'm training that little bit harder or maybe I'm having that little bit less sugar or whatever it is
*  You know the sauce I'm cutting I don't really realize but just fine little things I'm doing and the weight just just falls off
*  And how much do you cut the week of the fight the week of the fight?
*  I'm usually about seven kilograms out, you know, so it seems like a lot but I hold a lot of water and then once
*  That's about 15 16 pounds. Yeah. Yeah, I think so
*  Yeah, so I'm about there and you know a lot of it will end up coming off during the week
*  So again, I hold a lot of water so I blow it up man. I'll look at a piece of bread and I'll put on
*  Five kilos of water. Yeah, so that's just how I am
*  So I actually mean I'll probably get myself in trouble, but I end up weighing in at 145. So yeah 145
*  Usually a little bit less actually last few times and I was getting up to 160 was it
*  166 or something like that coming water was my end up getting to 76 kilograms Wow, so I end up putting like 22 pounds or so
*  Yes. Yeah, so overnight
*  Yes, how's that feel though when you do well, I'm used to I'm that weight or or can't pretty much. That's my weight
*  I'm comfortable at that. You know what I mean? So I'm about even two weeks out from a fight
*  I'm about 75 kg, you know, maybe 74, but I'm pretty close to it. It's a real science, isn't it?
*  It is 100% and again to be able to eat what I eat, you know
*  Fight week and I look at the food and now if I we can be like what our good Z's, you know
*  All over my social media. I'm just like what?
*  Lucky I am before I when I used to do that lucky enough fight week and do my stories
*  I'm just here literally show like six pieces of nuts and a little piece of chicken
*  Where now I got like mad like in meals and they you know, obviously decorated changed. How did he change it?
*  I just yeah like again, they just know before I didn't know I just knew I had to cut sodiums and carbs and I'll do
*  That you know, you know four or five days out and then again, I'll deplete a lot of water
*  But I would like you know drink distilled water and stuff like that
*  And but you know again, you're still doing similar sort of stuff
*  But everything's more calculated now and you know, and you know, they they do all the measurements and you know calculate everything and this again
*  The science to it. It's crazy
*  Now I'm usually a couple of kilos heavier when I got a sweat like that from the night before but it comes off easy and I
*  Feel good. So I've got energy and it's easy to come off. Hmm. So like what's a typical meal for breakfast for you?
*  Fight week. No like during training. Okay, you're getting it's usually when I get close
*  I love my oats, you know, like it heat it up and because it always fills me up
*  I feel like I can I should be eating more but I don't even need it
*  That much like you know, so there's some meals like now because we train so hard
*  But that's that's what I mean by the difference
*  You know, I was eating next to nothing to now not even being able to eat some of the stuff that they want me to eat
*  I'm like man, I can't eat that much like, you know me I probably could but I'm like I don't need to you know
*  I mean and right and
*  Yeah, cuz we do like anywhere three four sessions a day and and some of them like, you know
*  We tell them what workouts and you know, we've got a scale on one to ten
*  How are they our workout sessions? Yeah, it's some days. Yeah. Yeah, really? Yeah. Yes
*  I'll do a you know, usually three on average, but
*  Again lucky it's gonna be controlled doesn't mean I'm I'm actually you know, going the balls to war every session
*  You got to be structured to it
*  But I'll do strength and conditioning a couple days a week and then I'll usually when I'm back home in Australia
*  It's the you know, the free sessions every day and then sometimes I do strength and conditioning
*  So when we go to you know, New Zealand, it's usually in the morning
*  We'll do a couple sessions and then we'll get a session at night as well
*  But again with some of these episodes some of these
*  sort of training sessions
*  Full-on like I said, and we're burning like anywhere from 1200 calories to more like a 14 and we're fit
*  So to burn them sort of calories while you're that fit, you know, it's a that's a lot of hard work
*  So we're doing that and then they're like, you know, they're gonna feed us like all this
*  So we can have the energy to train like and that's what I mean
*  Like some meals I'm like man, I don't think I could even think that but it's crazy
*  To be able to do that and then and like be happy with what you're eating and then go into five week and stuff
*  Oh, it's a game changer really is yeah
*  That's where the value of having someone who's an actual nutritionist really comes into play where they tell you no
*  This is the calories that you need and this is this is gonna give you all the electrolytes and the protein the carbohydrates
*  This is everything. Yeah, you're good. Yeah when you're like, you sure? Yeah, and that's exactly right
*  But that's how it is. That's what I will be like while I'm eating
*  I'm like man, I know if I should be eating this the funny thing is if you're starving yourself with the chicken and the nuts
*  Like you're not gonna lose as much weight
*  It's not gonna be as easy because your body's gonna try to hold on to food and you're not gonna have any energy
*  Yeah, well, I've only done the chicken and that's fight week. But I mean again early earlier in my career
*  I was just eating nowhere near enough. I remember I remember I sort of went off
*  My wife's a meal plan that she had and like she wasn't even training and also and also meal that she was meant to be
*  Like, you know the meal meals that she was having not even training then I'm a you know, obviously if you kill as ever
*  I'm working a lot harder. I'm obviously you know training and doing all that
*  So I'm trying to stick to this diet that she's meant to lose weight on, you know what I mean?
*  So was a it's yeah, that's what I would you know, that's what I would sort of do my diets
*  And that's when the staph infections always come and it's crazy. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  So when you say you're working out three to four times a day, like how do you break up your sessions to someone is someone?
*  Dictating what you're gonna be doing for the day. Do you have someone who plans out your workouts?
*  Oh, you most weeks are pretty much the same
*  But obviously you're gonna have your like that's the thing like, you know, Joe my coach
*  No one knows me better than he is so he knows when I'm not on, you know
*  He knows when I something's happened. So there was before the max fight. There was a you know
*  I don't want to miss training sessions, you know what I mean?
*  So I'm gonna go there but they could see I was run down and that's when the injuries can happen and that's when you can
*  Get sick and all this type of stuff. So they pulled me up and as much as I didn't want oh, no
*  I'll be right. They didn't let me train that night and have like a day off and
*  Man, honestly that the next day the next sessions after that I was I was on fire and I finished it
*  You know what I mean? And perfect, you know, that was a again at the time. I'm like, oh, you know
*  I don't want to miss out on trial. I don't want to feel like it, you know
*  I don't feel like I'm not working hard enough. You know, I mean, so that's sort of how I was
*  Thinking but then the next day it just made me even work so much harder and I've done the via to max session wrestling
*  Session and absolutely killed it
*  You know what I mean? And that just and that was my last week of training and I just finished it
*  Perfect like sort of you know, right on peak, you know, obviously that's why you structure to peak
*  You know week out and that was you know, it was perfect as with the nutritionist
*  It shows you the value of having a real professional that and particularly someone who really knows you and knows like you're not gonna slack off
*  You're you know, you're a guy who's gonna go balls out. Yeah
*  So if you're tired like that something's up and so many coaches or so many fighters rather don't have a coach like that
*  Yeah, and so they will over train and they'll come into a fight beaten down. Yeah, and it's it's unfortunate
*  It really is that's what I mean the one percent is and you were saying with the mental coaches and all that
*  Look, I just think there's so many places that you could really really, you know work with it
*  And I think it that all that will help in the end that one percent now how much of your?
*  Camp is dedicated to strength and conditioning how many strength conditioning sessions?
*  I'll do anywhere from there two to three to three week. So I'm doing it
*  Yeah, two to three a week and what kind of stuff are you doing?
*  Again, I started with Bay Med a performance so they come on board because I used to get a lot of those the name of it
*  Bay Med Bay Med so yeah performance so they do with a lot of athletes so they do
*  Rugby league teams and all that sort of stuff
*  It was a that was a game changer for me because I was having a lot of problems with my back before I think this was
*  Before Chad Mendez so there was even times in my career where I was like thinking I might have to like give this up
*  Like and we are after the Elkins fight. What was wrong with your back?
*  I just I have a bulging disk
*  But like I would get all the sciatica down the leg and at the time I just thought
*  It was so much worse than it was and it was mentally getting me and you know, it was just a really
*  Lower ones. Yeah, which one was but the low one
*  So I've got a couple of the but I even went to a specialist and they were telling me that you know to give it
*  Up like I don't know whether it was just something that
*  You know, he has to say like it a cover himself or whatever guys are always so negative
*  Yeah, they told me to give it up and like again
*  I was already mentally getting me and then I had these guys come on board and they're like no
*  There's nothing wrong mate 80% of people
*  Literally have bulging this and don't worry until literally goes until your foot
*  You know stays flat and you know drags and all that sort of stuff from the sciatica or you can't control your bowels
*  That's when we'll start
*  Just start shitting yourself will tell you to stop
*  We might maybe do the surgery or something like that
*  So this is sort of what again they were trying to get in my head and really
*  Sort of just you know, let me sort of smash this mentally as well
*  And so they started getting me thinking like and again, I'm pretty good at this type of stuff
*  So I'm like, all right, no worries. They got me in on a mad program. They built a strength program
*  Specifically for my body, you know for what I do fighting and all that
*  So it's absolute game changer and I don't have problems now when I used to
*  There's times where I was having like anywhere from 14 weeks to not train and it before I fought like Elkins
*  Yeah, Elkins Jeremy Kennedy. I was doing next to nothing in between the fight and then literally having six weeks to do
*  Yes, so you're trying to recover. Well, I'm trying just just I'll try my pain
*  Yes, I my back will go and then I'll have like two weeks off try to get back into it
*  but it'll happen again and I was doing this for like 14 weeks straight and then getting told I'm fighting and then you know do
*  A camp and be like I've got six weeks to get myself ready. Do you do any spinal decompression or anything?
*  No, well, no, not that we just do a lot of it's just again hip mobility and all that again
*  So a lot of times I've done a lot of mobility before I do sessions and stuff like that that that really does help
*  We've what I'm doing. Yeah, I want you to try this this thing. I have out there. Yes teeter decks
*  It's this thing you you climb into it's real simple
*  You put your legs behind it almost like a leg curl and then you lean forward and as you lean forward all the weight is
*  Just decompresses on your back and particularly your lower back. It's fantastic for it. It feels so good
*  Yeah, I do it after every workout
*  I do two things for my back that are really big one is a thing called the reverse hyper you ever use one of those
*  No, is that like with the round thing that like no, no, that's another one. That's a hip glute
*  Okay hamstring thing the
*  Reverse hyper is this machine that was created by Louis Simmons from Westside barbell
*  It's like a flat bench
*  You climb your upper body up on the bench and then you hook your legs into this thing and you lift your legs up
*  And then you let them drop down and as it drops down it decompresses
*  Oh, okay as you lift it up it strengthens
*  All right comes from this guy. Louis Simmons is like he's a powerlifting legend and he had a back injury
*  They were they were trying to do surgery on yeah, and he was like, well, what's it from? They were like it's from compression
*  He's like well, I gotta figure out how to decompress it. So he figured out this machine that created active decompression
*  I have one out here. I swear by it. I love it. There it is right there. It shows it how it works
*  Okay, so when you lift up
*  Don't stare that dudes ass when you lift up it goes up and then when it lives down
*  It actually pulls the back and decompresses and it feels great pull that video that right there
*  You can see it if you watch that video you can see that's Louis. He's a fucking character. He's a really
*  Wild guy, but so see how it's going down. Yeah, that thing pulls your back down
*  So what I'll do is and on the up it strengthens the back muscles in a real unique way
*  Yeah, so what I'll do is I'll do that and then after I do that then I'll decompress with the decks
*  That's the decks. That's the thing right there
*  So you see you climb into that thing and then see how she's got her hands on that those handles
*  You let go of that and it just all makes your lower back like much give it to you to try out here
*  Gonna climb in there you're gonna go I need this
*  Yeah, man, it's I love it. I just want at home too. I swear by it. I fucking swear by this thing. Yeah
*  Look into having that because your own body weight is like pulling your spine apart and decompressing it just relaxes everything
*  It's very nice. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's it
*  Well, hey, you know again, it's just you you need these types that you need
*  Like obviously the knowledge is getting there with everything, you know, yeah the knowledge is out there
*  So what kind of shit do they have you doing a lot of it was a strengthening so I was a
*  Lot of big problem of mine
*  Like I was getting told like it lock your call like when I'd get my back, you know
*  And there was a bit more old-school type of stuff just lock your call, you know, don't do nothing
*  You know
*  I'll literally do nothing for like a whole week and then try and get back to and then I would injure it again
*  I would like literally if you told me to stand up, you know, I would like hold my breath and like stand up
*  You know what? I mean, I was like you that know
*  That's just sort of my mental side of the sort of where I was that with it and it was you know
*  I mean, so they had to change all that they had to you know, relax
*  You know, let me look literally they said if you you know
*  If you drop a look this one thing he said to me the first time maybe goes you drop a pencil
*  Pick the fucking pencil up, you know, you don't have to don't fucking game plan
*  How you're gonna pick up that pencil and like you're giving me trying to get in my head like just relax
*  You know what? I mean and the training even though this the first few sessions I started doing from a strength program
*  Like cause I would always like really hyper extend my back and like you're thinking I'm keeping it straight and you know
*  I think I'm doing the right thing
*  But so they had to try and change my posture and everything while I was doing workouts just so I could start
*  You know doing things properly like even when I used to do deadlifts
*  I would like try and stay as upright as I could because I thought my back would go
*  My back would go every time I thought they're deadlifts and that cuz I've my technique was bad and just little things like so
*  That's what I mean by having a strength
*  Program and all this sort of stuff and now looks if I do get a flare up, you know within you know
*  Even the next day I'm back into back into training
*  You know me where before I'd have like two weeks off literally two weeks off where now I'm like back at training like they're they're
*  Like you can't stop moving like you need to keep moving that that'll you know
*  Don't let your body look at my my brain would literally make it lock up. I'll get my hip out to the side
*  It was bad. Like I really was I would get a flare up and I'll be oh and then my brain would just toy
*  Go back to that position, you know where you go
*  Go out and I wouldn't be able to walk for a few days and and this just yeah, that was keep happening
*  But now we're on top of it now. It's a game changer now. I'm having camps
*  I get a full full proper camp so that that happened before
*  Chad Mendez, so that's when I end up seeing them and I had my first proper 12 week camp
*  For for the you know for the chairman is amazing. Yeah, that's amazing
*  So what kind of stuff they have you doing other than you said deadlifts and strength?
*  Oh, yeah, a lot of the glutes cuz I would my my glute my right glute wasn't even firing
*  Yeah, just cuz yeah, yeah, yeah, well just not just that just the fact that I would use my back muscles and core to do everything
*  I wasn't ever activating my glutes to do stuff because you know
*  I was just using the wrong muscles thinking you know, I was doing it right way now
*  Like that's a big part of my my sort of mobility before I do what I do my mobility and I get the glutes firing
*  And stuff like that and every time I do that I feel good
*  So a lot of the strength program is still building the glutes and and stuff like obviously you're still doing your core exercises now
*  We're at a stage where we can just sort of build
*  Everything you know and and even just having people that know what they're doing again
*  You could go there and they can just work on everything and I let's let's go nuts
*  But you know the specific sort of training knowing that I've got to go and do my other sessions at the other gym and all
*  That so they all take it all into play and you know that everything's just real structured
*  you know fight, you know training weeks are so much more structured than it used to be and
*  You're seeing it
*  You know not only in performances
*  But even my body and being able to train them it's a game-changer. That's amazing. Wow, you're really really fortunate that you found those guys
*  Yeah, 100% it was it was huge and I do any yoga or stretching or anything
*  I do like yes stretches and all that like I don't do it. I'll be honest
*  I don't do it enough like I should be sticking to especially when I'm not
*  While I'm back home. I do that in my sessions that I'm doing with them
*  So I'm doing that I meant to be doing that every day, but you know, I like it
*  I like it. Sometimes I should be doing a lot more
*  So sometimes I won't do and I'll feel like it tight every time I go on an airplane
*  I come to you know come to America and all that come and I'm just stiff as a board
*  you know, I mean and but as soon as I do these mobility sort of exercises and
*  Stretches and and like get the glutes going
*  I'm 100% like straight away show me someone who doesn't have a back issue that trains martial arts and I'll show you someone who doesn't train
*  enough
*  You're gonna have a back problem at least a little bit of stiffness, you know, it's yeah, that's just always yeah
*  Comes with it. What is it? You see sometimes like memes and they'll be like going best childhood memory not having a sore back
*  you know things like that kids man my
*  Middle daughter she's 11 and she she's so fucking flexible her spine
*  She could stand and then bend backwards and put her hands behind her on the ground and then kick her legs up in the air
*  And go over like what in the fuck are you made out of little kids man? Yeah, man. They're made out of rubber
*  Yep, that's all it is like that actually. Yeah, I mean 100% I even with
*  my daughter once actually
*  Probably cop some flack for this but I remember I was you know, sometimes they just I didn't know so one time
*  She's like sort of film
*  I was like holding her by her arm and she ended up like having like a little
*  Dislocate like sort of elbow and I didn't know and like she was just crying
*  I thought she was crying cuz we left the park and
*  Stuff like that. No, I just just the thing I literally just hadn't she just fell and I just like sort of
*  Yeah, well I just well, yeah just grabbed it by the arm and right and like, you know
*  I just again like it hyper lucky to break her infant
*  But obviously have been young and they're a bit more flexible but like full hyper extended her to her arm
*  But she was alright a couple of days wasn't too bad. I literally thought I broke my daughter's arm
*  Imagine telling people this story, you know what I mean, sir. It's crazy. But yeah, some of the same things you see the kids do
*  Yeah, well, they're just they're built to fall down. Yeah
*  Just don't hold on now and when they do so
*  So what about running are you doing a lot of running? Um, I don't do as
*  Much running I sometimes are the weight loss and all that but you know I get you know
*  obviously when you try and get your
*  You know your your heart rate at a certain amount and doing your what is it the endurance?
*  You would know
*  You know not via to max like when you're doing the like when you run in a consistent run or something
*  Keeping your heart rate at a certain. Yes, I mean I rather on the top person. I'd rather be drilling at the gym
*  I'll keep my heart rate there and I'll be drilling and I'll just do hours or an hour. Do you use a chest monitor?
*  Yeah, we do. Yeah, we do. Yeah, we do that with a lot of our sessions and yeah, that's again
*  We just try and structure everything. We're all about the science and stuff like that. Yeah, I mean it's
*  It's so important, but so many people don't do it. They just go by feel
*  You know, but when you if you really have great coaches, especially great scientific based strength and conditioning coaches
*  They really understand the science behind getting your body into a great endurance spot. Mmm
*  Even though we even do like we get our HRV
*  So every morning to see for you know, it tells us if we can train or usually say yet
*  You're good to go or something like I pull up, you know, right?
*  And so you've it tells you how your body sort of yeah, I don't know how it works trap
*  I wear one of these things. Okay, variability straps. Yeah, it's big. It's big
*  It shows you if you're fucking wrecked because sometimes you feel like maybe I'm just being a pussy and then I can look at my phone
*  And I go no man, you're fucking you're not you haven't recovered
*  Yeah, there's a thing that'll show you where your static heart rate is where your normal resting heart rate is where it is now
*  It shows you've trained too hard. Yeah, and then sometimes we're looking like yeah, you just been a little bit
*  It should say that too
*  So you prefer drilling to things like
*  Running. Yeah, I've done a fair bit of running it like when I was in Thailand and stuff like you know, they obviously make it run
*  Yeah, exactly. Right, but I'll be honest
*  Don't do as much now. So again doing the force the four sessions day three four sessions a day
*  I just say I'm the top person that I'm just a believer of a drilling
*  You know, I can be a lot more fight specific. Yeah, I'm getting that heart rate there. So that's just how I am
*  Everyone's different obviously it's working for you
*  Yeah, you know sometimes that's a big part of it too
*  It was like having a thing that you believe in and the thing that gives you confidence and you know
*  It's obvious that you have great endurance as well. So it is physically working for you as well
*  Exactly, so you'll do three different sessions at least a day and
*  You're breaking them up like a strength and conditioning maybe a boxing workout kickboxing jiu-jitsu
*  Maybe an MMA workout. Like how do you how do you how does it structure? Yeah, you're most most mornings
*  You'll do like an MMA sort of workout. So you put it all I'm all about putting it all together
*  You know what I mean? No, I don't like to separate each discipline, but obviously we still do that as well
*  We'll do like wrestling some days a couple of days a week and then the jiu-jitsu every morning
*  We'll do as well. We've got wall work sessions and you know, it's just we just do everything and then you've got certain sessions
*  That are like via to max wrestling and things like that
*  So it's just and these are mapped out by your coaches in it. Yeah. Yeah, so, you know, like what the week is gonna be like
*  Yeah, yeah, pretty much pretty much the same every every week
*  That's the difference between now and the old days man the old days guys just work out till they dropped
*  No one knew what the fuck anybody was doing right, you know, no way really no one knew
*  Yeah, what about sparring and and what is your philosophy on sparring hard versus sparring light? Yeah, man
*  Oh, you know, especially Joe like we're all about, you know
*  More technical sparring obviously we have like our Saturdays is where we spar and that's a little bit more full-on
*  But you know, you know, you don't get paid in the gym
*  And again, if you're going balls of war every every time you spar, you know, I mean like we're how do you learn as well?
*  I believe that you know keeping it a little bit more chill. You can work on things
*  Yeah, that's why I love training with all different types of styles
*  Even if I train with something that's not on my level, that's where I can learn so much as well
*  That's when I can act try things right?
*  There's things that if you're going against someone that's a you know better than you or just as good and you can't make any mistakes
*  So you're you're playing it safe like inspiring every day, you know what I mean?
*  And but again, we're all about you know, keeping it pretty chill, you know, especially during the week
*  We spar probably like, you know anywhere from free, you know, four sessions maybe even a week
*  But a lot of times it's very very very chill, you know, very technical
*  Technical sparring and again, that's where you learn and that's when you know, I think it works
*  It's been working for me. But then our Saturdays is we've got a little bit harder, but not not too hard
*  So it's never like a full-on bro. No, I never never full-on ball
*  That's another brilliant thing that people learn today because back in the day everybody used to just brawl
*  Yeah, man
*  I mean, there's so many story like the best stories come out of Brazil the curative stories from shoot the box
*  Okay
*  Yeah, those guys used to knock each other out and training and just keep training. Yeah wake up get back in there
*  Just push them back in there and if you could just imagine, you know, it's not too good for the brain
*  Terrible for the brain. I mean get a head and Vegas trips not good for the brain
*  Both things. Yeah. Well, listen brother
