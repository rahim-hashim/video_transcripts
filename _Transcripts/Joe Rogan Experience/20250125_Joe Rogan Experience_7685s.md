# JRE MMA Show #165 with Jiri Prochazka
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6.0s)]
*  Great to have you in, man. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=12.0s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=14.0s)]
*  How you feeling? You must be feeling fantastic. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=15.0s)]
*  Many things were successful, so even if I was a little bit, had a flu, many things... [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=17.0s)]
*  You had a flu before that fight? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=29.0s)]
*  Yeah, for one week, like five days before fight week, I was in... how to say that... [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=31.0s)]
*  Heat, like body's... [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=41.0s)]
*  Fever? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=43.0s)]
*  Fever, fever, yeah, fever. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=44.0s)]
*  So... [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=46.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=47.0s)]
*  That was something, but every time... [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=49.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm a little bit glad for that because every time trying to push my preparation too much, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=53.0s)]
*  that I'm every time like hurt myself or I'm over trained. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=61.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=67.0s)]
*  So that's why I'm maybe just a little bit glad for that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=68.0s)]
*  That's interesting, right? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=73.0s)]
*  Like it's so hard because you want to prepare so hard, you're so disciplined, so driven, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=74.0s)]
*  but you can do yourself a disservice. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=80.0s)]
*  You can go too far and then you don't recover enough and then you go into the fight a little compromised. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=83.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=88.0s)]
*  Yeah, we've seen that many times with fighters who just get so enthusiastic about their training. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=89.0s)]
*  Yeah, because I feel like self-confidence and still there is something what you can do better, yeah, every day. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=93.0s)]
*  And that's my idea of the training life idea to go better every day, 1% better, 1% better. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=105.0s)]
*  Even if you can't train, you can sit in the meditation and visualize it, how you train, how the body is working. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=114.0s)]
*  Sometimes it's the most biggest thing what you can do is just rest, like you showed me the floating. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=125.0s)]
*  Yes, yeah, you need one of those, man. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=139.0s)]
*  All the people that I know, you need one, sensory deprivation tank, you should get one of those. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=142.0s)]
*  Because I know you're into meditation, I know you spend a lot of time in dark rooms. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=148.0s)]
*  That's meditation times 100. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=152.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=155.0s)]
*  Do you monitor your heart rate every day to see what your recovery is at or you just go by feel? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=156.0s)]
*  Feeling, feeling, feeling. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=161.0s)]
*  I did that in high-altitude training in early November in Mexico, Mexico City, where it's 2,300, 2,200 meters. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=163.0s)]
*  Yeah, 7,700 feet above sea level, I believe. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=176.0s)]
*  Yes, and there I monitor everything, take blood exams before and after these four-weeks camp there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=179.0s)]
*  Man, amazing, amazing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=191.0s)]
*  But your endurance was incredible in that fight because that was such a high-paced fight. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=194.0s)]
*  And still, I felt like after that flu, I felt a little bit down. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=200.0s)]
*  Well, that's pretty amazing then. You must have been in insane shape before the flu. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=208.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's that fine line, that balance. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=213.0s)]
*  So you went to Mexico City, did you know a gym up there or did you bring your camp up there? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=217.0s)]
*  I was there in the UFC Performance Institute there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=224.0s)]
*  There's a new one. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=228.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=230.0s)]
*  You have everything here in the Performance Institute, like regeneration, training, coaches, coaches with the pads. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=231.0s)]
*  And so I was there especially to work on the things that I took from the last fight with Pereira, to work on the hands up a little bit, just a little bit. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=240.0s)]
*  A little bit. But we were talking about it in the broadcast, your hands down sometimes has a benefit. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=258.0s)]
*  There's a real advantage to it because no one sees where those punches are coming from. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=265.0s)]
*  So for the people that don't know what I'm talking about. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=270.0s)]
*  Not just punches, movement, head movement. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=273.0s)]
*  Head movement was excellent. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=276.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=277.0s)]
*  Your head movement was excellent. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=278.0s)]
*  And the feeling with the hands up is another one with the hands down. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=279.0s)]
*  Because this is your natural posture. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=291.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=294.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=295.0s)]
*  So you spend the most of the time in this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=296.0s)]
*  And it's about just feeling the space. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=299.0s)]
*  I can't explain to another person like this one because when I am in, in the flow, like you want to be in the flow, in the fight, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=304.0s)]
*  some between the flow and uncomfortable, somewhere in the center. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=315.0s)]
*  So when I achieved this attitude, that's why I don't need to keep my hands up because this for me means and for everybody, that means defending. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=320.0s)]
*  I don't need to defend myself when I see when I see everything, when I feel everything. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=333.0s)]
*  When I feel everything. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=338.0s)]
*  And but like I understand in this preparation where I tried, where I did all the camp hands up like this gives you the calm in in a close distance, in a close distance. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=339.0s)]
*  It's not so sometimes it's not so smart to to keep hands down. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=357.0s)]
*  Hands down. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=365.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=366.0s)]
*  So I'm crazy. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=367.0s)]
*  I'm crazy enough to to go through to be in the moment to stress my body so much in this situation to see every movement, every start of the movement of my opponent that I can react before he start. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=368.0s)]
*  And the next level is to try to to to to read read the thinking of the opponent, what he wants to do before he do that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=384.0s)]
*  So so there is a many levels of that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=400.0s)]
*  So but sometimes I can't explain that sometimes like in the second fight with Pereira, I was a little bit punched in the in the in the end of the first round. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=404.0s)]
*  So I stepped to the second round and I said to myself, I was too courageous and keep the hands down. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=420.0s)]
*  So so that's why it happened. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=427.0s)]
*  Well, you should have been more defensive maybe to recover. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=430.0s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=433.0s)]
*  One thing you said after that fight, you said you have to evolve. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=434.0s)]
*  And one thing that I saw in this last fight with Jamal Hill was evolution. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=437.0s)]
*  I really saw it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=442.0s)]
*  You really see it like the counters, the head movement and the counters were brilliant. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=444.0s)]
*  There's one that I put on my Instagram stories. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=450.0s)]
*  It was so incredible. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=454.0s)]
*  He threw a punch. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=455.0s)]
*  You slid slightly out of the way, landed a straight left and then the right hook that dropped him. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=457.0s)]
*  But it was so dynamic. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=463.0s)]
*  It was so fast and precise. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=465.0s)]
*  I was like, that's a different Yuri Prohaska. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=467.0s)]
*  Like the your earlier fights were always excellent. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=470.0s)]
*  You always had amazing power and very unusual movement, very difficult to predict. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=474.0s)]
*  But the sharpness of your counters was on another level in this fight. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=478.0s)]
*  That's what I worked on. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=483.0s)]
*  To be not just connect to the opponent and react what's happened right now, but a little bit before what will happen. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=484.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=497.0s)]
*  Well, you're definitely getting better, which is so fascinating. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=498.0s)]
*  You had a very brilliant approach. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=502.0s)]
*  You waited until you had reached a certain level before you entered the UFC. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=504.0s)]
*  You could have been in the UFC years earlier. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=509.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=511.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=512.0s)]
*  Fitness isn't just about what you do in the gym. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=513.0s)]
*  It's also about your nutrition. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=515.0s)]
*  But even with the best diet, some nutrients can be hard to get and AG1 can help fill those gaps. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=516.0s)]
*  AG1 delivers optimal amounts of nutrients in forms that help your body perform. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=522.0s)]
*  AG1 makes foundational nutrition easy because there aren't a million different pills and capsules you have to keep track of. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=527.0s)]
*  It's just one scoop mixed in water. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=533.0s)]
*  It's such an easy routine to keep in the mornings. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=535.0s)]
*  Ingredients in AG1 are selected for absorption, nutrient density, and potency and are intentionally picked to work in sync with the whole formula for optimal impact. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=537.0s)]
*  They are seriously committed to quality. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=547.0s)]
*  AG1 has tested for hundreds of contaminants and impurities, and they're constantly reformulating their recipe to dial it in. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=549.0s)]
*  This is all part of why I've partnered with AG1 for years. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=556.0s)]

*  Seriously, get on this. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=581.0s)]
*  Yes, and I have to say thank you to my coaches for that because we worked on my style. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=583.0s)]
*  We are consulting, like communicate about that style, what to make better, how to do that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=592.0s)]
*  That's why I'm keeping like my two coaches, what I began with, began with like all the time with me because I think that's the... [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=600.0s)]
*  That's the only thing you can go to be a master in something to stay with some people with some... [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=612.0s)]
*  Tight circle. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=624.0s)]
*  Yeah, tight circle in some and go deeper. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=625.0s)]
*  You can go really deep. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=628.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=630.0s)]
*  It's also I value loyalty. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=631.0s)]
*  Loyalty is very important. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=633.0s)]
*  And this is... [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=635.0s)]
*  It means a lot, you know, and when people worked really hard to get you to a certain level. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=636.0s)]
*  What I like is there's some coaches that they recognize that maybe there's other skill sets they can bring in. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=640.0s)]
*  So they work with other people as well, you know, but always stay with the people that brought... [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=646.0s)]
*  As long as the relationship is good, always stay with the people that brought you to the game. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=652.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure, sure, because in the end you can change whoever, but you have to start again with the same people and go... [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=656.0s)]
*  And again, you will go to the same level, to the same problems with these people because it's not about them. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=667.0s)]
*  It's always about you to recognize what's in you. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=676.0s)]
*  How much tape do you watch? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=679.0s)]
*  Do you watch a lot of film? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=681.0s)]
*  Do you watch videos of fights? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=682.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=684.0s)]
*  I was five days sick before the fight. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=685.0s)]
*  So I just watched Spartans 300. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=688.0s)]
*  Yeah, Ong Bak I watched. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=694.0s)]
*  Ong Bak, man... [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=697.0s)]
*  That's wild shit. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=699.0s)]
*  Man, no wild shit, but I was really inspired. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=700.0s)]
*  I was really hungry to see something because long time I didn't see some good... [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=706.0s)]
*  Not good movie, doesn't matter if it's like good or new, but these old classics of the fighting, Jean-Claude Van Damme with Kickboxer and all these things. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=714.0s)]
*  That's what made a spark inside me to a true love for martial arts because in that movies they live that, really live that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=724.0s)]
*  And they have no other chance to solve their problems just by martial arts and something. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=739.0s)]
*  So that's why I'm... [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=746.0s)]
*  So you got inspired by movies. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=748.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=749.0s)]
*  Do you watch a lot of films of fight footage, like your fights, your opponent's fights? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=750.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't need many times to study that. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=754.0s)]
*  I just need to see once, I just see the attitude of the start of the fight, how he's fighting, his spirit, his mindset, how he's thinking, how is the start of moving of his body, how he's reacting for not just for opponent, for the many situations, for slipping and movement, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=759.0s)]
*  but everything, like personal, and studying that guy. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=786.0s)]
*  His energy. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=792.0s)]
*  His energy, his vibe, how he's reacting, how he's reacting in some situation like these eye pokes and all these things, like some breaks in the fight every time because it shows you how he has under control himself all the time, all the time. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=794.0s)]
*  And this is something what Alex Pereira, I don't know what is his story behind, but he handled that. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=821.0s)]
*  He handled that and that's why he is how he is. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=833.0s)]
*  Now he's starting to be more relaxed. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=836.0s)]
*  And I wish him to stay sharp. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=838.0s)]
*  Well, I think he's more relaxed outside the fight, but in the fight he's always very calm. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=843.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=848.0s)]
*  Very calm and very focused. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=849.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=851.0s)]
*  Did you watch your first fight with him before you watched the second, before you fought him the second time? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=852.0s)]
*  Yes, sure, sure. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=858.0s)]
*  I studied him a lot, but the second fight I little push it too much. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=860.0s)]
*  Too aggressive? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=870.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=871.0s)]
*  Training? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=873.0s)]
*  After the fight, I was like, I want Alex Pereira after I'm ready for him. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=875.0s)]
*  Right now, I'm ready too, but I'm open for whoever will, UFC will give me like a next opponent to prove that I am. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=880.0s)]
*  But I want a true challenge. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=894.0s)]
*  Like I want a true challenge from the, I think, top five guys. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=896.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=901.0s)]
*  The interesting thing about the light heavyweight division is there's only about five really exciting contenders. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=902.0s)]
*  Four or five really exciting. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=911.0s)]
*  There's not a deep pool of fighters that would be very interesting to see you fight. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=913.0s)]
*  That's right, because there is a, like I said today, there's a few guys who really have the taste, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=918.0s)]
*  have the drive to go to the top. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=928.0s)]
*  I want to go to the top. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=932.0s)]
*  I want to take it. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=933.0s)]
*  I have the, I feel the energy of the crown and I can take it. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=934.0s)]
*  So and that's why, that's why I'm, I'm doing that. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=940.0s)]
*  That's why I'm still talking about that to be there, because I really feel that, that I can be the top. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=947.0s)]
*  And one thing what I needed is that I had to be stable, stable to not just get to the top and back and out, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=956.0s)]
*  but to go to the top and know how, how it is to be there. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=970.0s)]
*  Know to, to, to keep the, all these weights on the top. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=975.0s)]
*  What there is. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=984.0s)]
*  Yeah, defending the title is more difficult even than, than getting the title. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=986.0s)]
*  And then it's improving while you're champion. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=992.0s)]
*  You know, they say that, Daniel Cormier always says that every champion improves like significantly once they become champion, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=995.0s)]
*  because you have the confidence of being champion. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1001.0s)]
*  And it's just how long can you maintain the kind of energy that's required to constantly get better? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1003.0s)]
*  Because it's not just about maintaining, right? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1010.0s)]
*  It's about constantly improving, constant analysis of all your movements and what you're doing right. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1012.0s)]
*  And what your mistakes that were made, what the thought process was before the mistake and how to eliminate that. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1019.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is something what, what is, like I said, the style of Japanese day, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1025.0s)]
*  they call that Kaizen. Yes. Kaizen, like daily improvements, small improvements, daily recognizing what's bad, what's good. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1032.0s)]
*  And sometimes it's like, I feel like it's like, like a sick, like to be upset, too much obsessed in that. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1041.0s)]
*  Man, you need a little break. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1048.0s)]
*  That's, that's why I think the life gave me these little break before. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1051.0s)]
*  The little flu. Yeah. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1057.0s)]
*  Was that why you came in so light? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1059.0s)]
*  Yeah. Was that why? That was that. That was why. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1062.0s)]
*  Because I was watching a video with Luke Thomas was going over your performance. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1064.0s)]
*  Everybody was very impressed and he was as well. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1068.0s)]
*  But one of the things that he was talking about was that you only weighed 208 pounds when you walked into the cage. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1070.0s)]
*  I thought I will do my best whenever go to the sauna night before the wedding and spend there. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1077.0s)]
*  And again, I, I changed, I switched myself in the sauna and I was there like for two hours. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1087.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1094.0s)]
*  Like 15 minutes, 15, 15, like many rounds. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1096.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1099.0s)]
*  Do you do sauna cold or just sauna relax? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1101.0s)]
*  Relax, relax. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1105.0s)]
*  No, no, no, sauna cold. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1107.0s)]
*  Okay, so then you go back in the sauna. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1110.0s)]
*  Yes, sure. And cold normally like the cold, cold punch. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1112.0s)]
*  I'm doing that daily because I have at home the cold punch. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1117.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1121.0s)]
*  And I'm using that. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1122.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're fantastic. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1123.0s)]
*  And but the fun is the second day after that and I didn't drink anything after the sauna. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1125.0s)]
*  And next day morning I went, I went to do, to do control weight and then I have, I don't know, I would say in the liberis, 91 kilograms. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1136.0s)]
*  I'm fighting in, I'm fighting in 93. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1147.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1150.0s)]
*  And half. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1151.0s)]
*  And I was two and a half kilogram under my weight. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1153.0s)]
*  Sounds like 200 pounds. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1158.0s)]
*  So yeah, so I was the only one guy who was in a row to do weights, weighting and I tried to hide myself before other guys and I should drink one liter, one liter of the water, second liter of the water. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1159.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1176.0s)]
*  Just because you didn't want to weigh in light. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1177.0s)]
*  Because yeah, because I spent too much time in the sauna. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1179.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1182.0s)]
*  That's crazy because you only weighed 208. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1183.0s)]
*  Yeah, I felt really, really like. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1186.0s)]
*  You look great. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1188.0s)]
*  You look very lean and fast man. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1190.0s)]
*  Fast. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1193.0s)]
*  You look fast, like significantly. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1194.0s)]
*  You've always been very fast, but you looked even faster. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1196.0s)]
*  It's just all about this. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1199.0s)]
*  Man. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1201.0s)]
*  Man, well, if you have the reason why and the, and you can not just, you want it like your ego just want it, but you feel it like it's your destiny. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1202.0s)]
*  These moments and you, it's yours. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1215.0s)]
*  So then. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1218.0s)]
*  Then it will happen. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1222.0s)]
*  So do you feel like maybe even the the fighter Pereira or blessing and that it showed you what you need to work on. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1224.0s)]
*  Every time it's. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1234.0s)]
*  This is the only way how to how I want to see that. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1235.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1239.0s)]
*  Especially. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1240.0s)]
*  Especially the guy like him, who's really top guy and his style, his mindset, what he showed till now was something what I needed to work on. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1241.0s)]
*  Still, I'm on the way. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1263.0s)]
*  Well, his style is extraordinary. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1266.0s)]
*  It's very unusual, as is yours. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1268.0s)]
*  But the thing that's shocking the most about him is that he only needs to hit you once he's is it much different. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1271.0s)]
*  The power that you feel from him than anybody else. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1278.0s)]
*  There is a different from other guys. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1282.0s)]
*  Yeah, there is a different, but. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1285.0s)]
*  Only one thing I can say, like, I know the receive recipe. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1291.0s)]
*  You know the recipe. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1297.0s)]
*  Yeah. What's the recipe? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1298.0s)]
*  What's the recipe? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1299.0s)]
*  How to because you have to you have to know how to give the punch and how to act like to how to accept the punches, how to move, how to move with it and. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1300.0s)]
*  How to overcome the bad moments and all these things, but it's better, much better to defend the punch with the hand or defend the punch with the movement. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1316.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1329.0s)]
*  Did you ever watch any of his glory kickboxing fights? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1330.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1334.0s)]
*  This is a good one to watch the Artem Vahitov. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1335.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1337.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1338.0s)]
*  Because Vahitov's very technical. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1339.0s)]
*  I think he won. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1341.0s)]
*  He won a very close decision. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1342.0s)]
*  It was very close. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1344.0s)]
*  It was one of those fights where you could call it either way. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1345.0s)]
*  But but he won. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1347.0s)]
*  But he's very technical, very interesting to watch him deal with the style of Pereira because Pereira is such an unusual way of moving. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1348.0s)]
*  Like even the way he like holds his hands up and he looks different. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1358.0s)]
*  So do you. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1361.0s)]
*  You look different. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1362.0s)]
*  Like there's only a few fighters that if you saw their silhouette, I can go, oh, that's Yuri Prochaska. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1363.0s)]
*  I could see it right away. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1367.0s)]
*  I know how you move, you know, and Alex is that way as well. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1368.0s)]
*  It's like very unique way of moving. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1371.0s)]
*  But his the way Vahitov handled it is a good blueprint for a lot of people to avoid the power and keep the volume on him. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1374.0s)]
*  What was your original style? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1384.0s)]
*  What did what was the first martial art that you learned? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1386.0s)]
*  Muay Thai. Muay Thai. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1389.0s)]
*  Yeah, I started in in my high school. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1391.0s)]
*  I started with karate because there was it was in a in a daily daily schedule. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1393.0s)]
*  What kind of karate? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1399.0s)]
*  Shotokan. Shotokan and judo. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1400.0s)]
*  There was two and I felt like I need I need something more contact, more and more aggressive. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1404.0s)]
*  So not aggressive, but more more potent, more potent. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1413.0s)]
*  So I started with Muay Thai. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1418.0s)]
*  Yeah, the most potent. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1420.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1421.0s)]
*  Muay Thai is fascinating to me that this one island figured out how to fight better than anybody on the feet. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1423.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1429.0s)]
*  And a lot of it they did it through gambling. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1430.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot of it because they're so into gambling that they had so many fights and then people just fought a lot. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1432.0s)]
*  And then they're like, what works best? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1437.0s)]
*  And then they figured it out. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1439.0s)]
*  Yeah. And right now, after watching Ong Bak, I'm just I'm just still realizing what is the what is the. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1440.0s)]

*  Yes. Yes. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1557.0s)]
*  Because that was something what I was too inspired by. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1558.0s)]
*  By because I was a young guy who tried to to challenge everything around himself. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1564.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1573.0s)]
*  Every man, every situation, everywhere. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1574.0s)]
*  I will. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1578.0s)]

*  Better than anything. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1582.0s)]
*  Maybe not the school. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1583.0s)]
*  Just not in the school. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1585.0s)]
*  But I like the fighting. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1587.0s)]
*  I fall in love with the fighting, with looking for finding my biggest strength. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1590.0s)]
*  And that's that's the why I'm going every time to the nature. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1599.0s)]
*  To sleeping in the mountains. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1608.0s)]
*  To that's why I'm living in the cottage to be in the contact with the nature to feel the present moment and rare natural power of the of the water fire of all these things of the sun. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1609.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1624.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1625.0s)]
*  I was going to ask you about that. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1626.0s)]
*  Like when did you start this training in nature? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1628.0s)]
*  Because when you look at your setup that you have at your place and everything's outside, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1631.0s)]
*  you know, you put pads over trees and you punch and kick trees. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1636.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1640.0s)]
*  Sometimes it sometimes looks looks weird. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1641.0s)]
*  But but you know, wow, I don't like to do. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1643.0s)]
*  I don't like right now. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1650.0s)]
*  I realize I need to. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1652.0s)]
*  I want I right now I want to overcome the people demands the sparring partners in the in the training. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1654.0s)]
*  But like in my personal way, I was inspired by once I was inspired by Masuda to OYAMA was the founder of Kyoku Shinkai Karate. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1661.0s)]
*  And I saw his movie and how he spent more than one year, one and a half year in the mountains. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1676.0s)]
*  And he trained just in the mountains under the waterfall in the winter in the winter. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1684.0s)]
*  And he made from himself a really, really something like unshakeable mind, self-confidence, so deep because he he found a way how to overcome how to rule his body, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1690.0s)]
*  how to he's describing that in his book, like the mind without the thinking, like without the thoughts, pure mind, pure focus, pure consciousness right here right now. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1713.0s)]
*  And I took that like my own way. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1731.0s)]
*  And and I think it was year two, 14 to 15. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1737.0s)]
*  And I took everything in myself. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1743.0s)]
*  I took a tent tent. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1745.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I and I went to the to the mountains. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1749.0s)]
*  The mountains and I slept there for just for like one week, two weeks, one healthy. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1755.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I I was inspired too much. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1762.0s)]
*  So I did the same thing. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1765.0s)]
*  I ran there and I punched to the to the rock. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1767.0s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1771.0s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1773.0s)]
*  And I just and I just want to fight with the environment, like with the with the nature around me. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1776.0s)]
*  And in the end, you can realize there is no fighting. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1782.0s)]
*  There is nothing. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1788.0s)]
*  This is the pure life because this is the pure life because the pure the life has the one reason to overcome everything around and survive, survive, survive. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1790.0s)]
*  And this is the this is the nature what is in us. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1803.0s)]
*  So this is an as deeper you can go in this uncomfortable environment and all these things that deep. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1807.0s)]
*  You can understand the life and like be a philosopher about that, like understand, understand more deeply. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1818.0s)]
*  And I don't know what to say. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1829.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, you're saying it right. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1831.0s)]
*  Yeah, I understand what you're saying. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1833.0s)]
*  So that's why. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1834.0s)]
*  So I was inspired by the Masuda Tsuyama. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1835.0s)]
*  And that's why I decide after the second fight with Alex, I need to go to Japan, to Japan, to the places to make a black belt from Kyokushinkai karate and really feel all these things like realist realist, not just think about that, how it can be, how, how is this. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1838.0s)]
*  How is this style can be. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1863.0s)]

*  And I think, I think it's the only way. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1970.0s)]
*  It's also something fascinating about the fact that you do do it outside. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1972.0s)]
*  I think that scares people. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1976.0s)]
*  I think something about the fact that you like to be fighting in nature and punching trees. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1979.0s)]
*  Because I'm coming from, from, from, from one village where was there a lot of like good guys. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1984.0s)]
*  But everybody we were, we are still like really crazy. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1994.0s)]
*  When we are celebrating, it's all the time about right now we are trying to slow down to to show others like we are adults like we know we are the man. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=1999.0s)]
*  But still, it's about like the showing the strength. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2011.0s)]
*  Yeah, how what to what to destroy how to how to punch other guy. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2015.0s)]
*  How to how to show this, the strength above others. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2021.0s)]
*  So, and when, when there was when there started on the okay, like I said, when, when on these parties started level of like, it was really dangerous. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2026.0s)]
*  Fire and firearms and the cars and fire and it was not safe. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2043.0s)]
*  And I said, guys, okay, we are a man. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2052.0s)]
*  Let's be mature. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2057.0s)]

*  That's something what you what you have to realize. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2065.0s)]
*  And these these ascents of a looking for a strength. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2066.0s)]
*  These something these true madness, like, like when I see these this picture of that. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2073.0s)]
*  And it remembered me that when I saw that when I came here, the JRE. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2088.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, the logo. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2092.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2094.0s)]
*  When I saw it, it remembered me like, yes, go through going through all the time. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2095.0s)]
*  Choose the choose the hardest way and go through overcome whatever and show you are the you are the boss. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2101.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2109.0s)]
*  And this is this is it. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2110.0s)]
*  This is why I'm I came from that place where we are tried to to show each other this one. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2114.0s)]
*  And I trying to carry that energy and put it in the in the calm way to to to show it in the in the cage. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2124.0s)]
*  And that's why the samurai ideas, the Bushido Codex helping me in that to to show it. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2138.0s)]
*  That's all I understand. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2146.0s)]
*  And and then you feel that in training in nature and then experiencing the wild and getting it out there, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2147.0s)]
*  it becomes even more pure because you recognize that all around you is survival. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2156.0s)]
*  That's that's right. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2161.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2162.0s)]

*  Yeah, we're on the same wave. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2167.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2169.0s)]
*  So when what year did you start doing this training in the wild? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2170.0s)]
*  Like I said in 2014, 2014. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2173.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2176.0s)]
*  Like I was I started was inspired by by Masuda to OYAMA. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2177.0s)]
*  And then I realized it's not about opponents, man. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2181.0s)]
*  It's about just your body, just about your real body. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2185.0s)]
*  How much you can you can rule your body, rule your mind, rule your emotions, logical state of thinking. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2189.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2195.0s)]
*  To find the way how to not overcome how to rule your breath. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2196.0s)]
*  Because this is this this is it. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2207.0s)]
*  This is the way. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2211.0s)]
*  And because this is the most primal thing of the body. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2212.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2217.0s)]
*  First when the child is born, like first his breath. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2218.0s)]
*  Everything is like you can you can settle by by the breath in the body, not just by thoughts and over the thinking and thoughts is like a great serve, but a bad boss. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2222.0s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2246.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2247.0s)]
*  So it serves you well, but it's you can't let it control you. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2248.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2251.0s)]
*  So there is a many levels what you have to what you have to rule in your in your body, what you have to understand. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2252.0s)]
*  And put it in put it in one way in the in the present moment. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2263.0s)]
*  So. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2268.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2271.0s)]
*  So you had your first fights when you're around 18, 19. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2272.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2275.0s)]
*  And then how long when did you decide that you were ready for the UFC and how did you make that decision? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2276.0s)]
*  Because I do know that you were offered fights before. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2282.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2285.0s)]
*  But you said I want more development time. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2286.0s)]
*  That was in us some somewhere in the center of between me in my sixth seventh fight in the rising. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2288.0s)]
*  So around the year to to 17 to 18. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2296.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2301.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2302.0s)]
*  So something like that. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2303.0s)]
*  And yeah, I realized that man, there is a there is a way in the rising. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2304.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2312.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2313.0s)]
*  So I need I need to know I need to I want to take a title here. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2314.0s)]
*  I want to prove that I'm the how to say like the the king of Japan like. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2318.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2326.0s)]
*  To to rule the rule these guys real really. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2327.0s)]
*  And then I can go to the to the League of the best because if you want to go to the League of the best better to be prepared for. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2330.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2339.0s)]
*  And yeah, I think that happens too often. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2340.0s)]
*  That's why I can can fight for a title in three fights. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2343.0s)]
*  I think boxing has it right. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2349.0s)]
*  And in that boxing, they look at fighters managers look at fighters as an investment. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2352.0s)]
*  So if you are a manager and you have like Floyd Mayweather, you don't give Floyd Mayweather the best fight. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2359.0s)]
*  You can get him right away with the toughest guy. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2365.0s)]
*  You want to see how he performs with a guy who is an inside puncher or body body puncher who's a brawler. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2368.0s)]
*  You want to see how he handles a slick guy like Emmanuel Augustus with unorthodox movement. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2374.0s)]
*  You want to how does he handle Diego Corrales long tall reach and you build them with fighters that you think you've got to know when they're ready. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2380.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2389.0s)]
*  And then there's an objective assessment. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2390.0s)]
*  OK, he's ready. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2392.0s)]
*  Then you start moving into top 10 contenders. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2394.0s)]
*  Then you move into a title shot. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2396.0s)]
*  He throws you right to the wolves. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2398.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2400.0s)]
*  It's good to have these objective. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2401.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2404.0s)]
*  And if you I like to to be just a watcher of the of my progress of the of the situation. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2405.0s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2414.0s)]
*  How to plan it. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2415.0s)]
*  How to how to see that not not personally just to see yourself as another person and put it in myself in a way where where it will be the best. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2416.0s)]
*  Where it will be the best for these for these targets. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2430.0s)]
*  And then go in and do that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2434.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2438.0s)]
*  And when you you had a very quick rise in the UFC to a title fight. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2439.0s)]
*  So you fought was Volkan Oztomir your first fight. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2445.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2447.0s)]
*  So you beat Volkan Oztomir then Dominic Reyes was the second fight. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2448.0s)]
*  And then bam title shot. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2451.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2454.0s)]
*  So that's the reason to be so prepared. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2455.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2457.0s)]
*  Because if you're successful things go very quickly. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2458.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2461.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2462.0s)]
*  To be ready. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2463.0s)]
*  When you look at your first fight with Volkan Oztomir and then you look at your fight with Jamal Hill. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2464.0s)]
*  Do you see significant improvement with who the first one when you look at your first fight in the UFC when you fought Volkan Oztomir and now you look at yourself now in the most spectacular performance against Jamal Hill. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2467.0s)]
*  Do you see the improvement. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2478.0s)]
*  Right now I can say yes. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2480.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2481.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2482.0s)]
*  Because there was a with the Volkan Oztomir there was a just a pure raw power. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2483.0s)]
*  Raw aggression. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2488.0s)]
*  Aggression. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2491.0s)]
*  Aggression. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2492.0s)]
*  But not so refined. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2493.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2495.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2496.0s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2497.0s)]
*  You can see that in the fight man. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2498.0s)]

*  Sometimes is the self confident like when you are too much self confident. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2509.0s)]
*  It's a bad thing. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2513.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2514.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2523.0s)]
*  It will burn you. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2524.0s)]
*  So you have to keep that burn that fire under control and to give the these. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2525.0s)]
*  These attacks these aggressive aggressive aggressiveness in just a small. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2535.0s)]
*  To keep it under control. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2546.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2547.0s)]
*  I like what you just said that ego will take you to another line. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2548.0s)]
*  Man it's it's good to be to have it. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2552.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2556.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2568.0s)]
*  You can't live without but also you have to cultivate that in like so there is a two two worlds like. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2569.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2575.0s)]
*  Without the knife. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2576.0s)]
*  So you have to go in. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2577.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2579.0s)]
*  They have to be working together the mind and the ego have to be working together and the no mind. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2580.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2585.0s)]
*  The flow. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2586.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2587.0s)]
*  And the ego will take you out of the flow. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2588.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2589.0s)]
*  The ego like fuck him up and then boom you get hit. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2590.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2593.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2594.0s)]
*  I like what you said though about it takes you out of the line because it takes you into [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2595.0s)]
*  a different line. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2598.0s)]
*  It takes you in a different line of fighting and then sometimes in that line you'll realize [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2599.0s)]
*  you're out of place. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2605.0s)]
*  You realize you're leaving openings that shouldn't be there and you're trying to force. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2606.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2611.0s)]
*  Good force. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2612.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2613.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2614.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2615.0s)]
*  And good. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2616.0s)]
*  When you you said like when you realize that it's bad when you don't realize. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2617.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2621.0s)]
*  Sometimes it's good when you have the people around you to to man bring you back bring [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2622.0s)]
*  you back. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2626.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2627.2s)]
*  That's why I'm sometimes really glad for my team my people around me to keep me back. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2628.2s)]
*  That's what's amazing about having a coach who knows you having trainers who know you. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2633.64s)]
*  They know they're like they know where you're at like come down come down. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2638.1s)]
*  That's right. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2641.24s)]
*  But you're hitting the gas too much like so be a little more technical move around more. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2642.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2647.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2648.24s)]
*  But not too much. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2649.24s)]
*  Not too much. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2650.24s)]
*  Not too much. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2651.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2652.24s)]
*  Because sometimes is that these wildness do it aggression do to take over like it's too [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2653.24s)]
*  necessary. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2656.4799999999996s)]
*  But well that's what I asked you after the fight. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2657.4799999999996s)]
*  I said there's something about you where you thrive. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2660.24s)]
*  You get better when it's chaotic. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2663.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2665.9599999999996s)]
*  There's something like it seems like you relish in the chaos of these wild exchanges. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2666.9599999999996s)]
*  Sometimes fighters like to piece people up where they're not getting hit like Jamal Hill's [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2672.44s)]
*  really good at that like the Glover to share a fight. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2677.04s)]
*  He had a fantastic job of utilizing his game and his accuracy and reach and he just put [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2679.28s)]
*  it on Glover. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2685.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2686.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2687.0s)]
*  But they don't want to be in these wild exchanges. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2688.0s)]
*  You seem to want to be in these wild exchanges because you thrive them. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2690.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2693.7200000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2694.7200000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2695.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know where is the where it is to keeping yourself and the control is going from. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2697.6s)]
*  Sometimes it's going from the fear to be not hit. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2705.3999999999996s)]
*  Sometimes it's going from to be careful for the takedowns. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2708.64s)]
*  And but I want to be like fearless in that like to stay behind stay before the opponent [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2711.64s)]
*  and have no no fear. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2721.64s)]
*  No. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2723.12s)]
*  I can go as close you want to get as close you want and try to hit me and you will not [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2724.52s)]
*  hit me because I'm here and I feel you. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2730.12s)]
*  I got you. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2733.16s)]
*  So I can explain it and I don't want to explain it. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2734.92s)]
*  I want to show that in a fight. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2737.7599999999998s)]
*  So I know what you're saying. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2739.2799999999997s)]
*  When you one of the things that we were talking about Daniel and I were talking about when [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2742.0s)]
*  we were doing the commentary was your head movement was so good. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2746.2799999999997s)]
*  It was it was different than before. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2749.44s)]
*  It was like at another level. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2751.7599999999998s)]
*  Like what what specifically had you do had you done to prepare that made your head movement [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2753.62s)]
*  so much better. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2759.22s)]
*  I have like a long time I'm working on that. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2760.22s)]
*  Like since my before I stepped into you know since my title fighting I really I really [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2765.8599999999997s)]
*  exactly know what what when I started to work on especially on that because I realized that [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2774.7799999999997s)]
*  this is my game. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2781.58s)]
*  This is really what's me. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2782.58s)]
*  And it was around the title fight with with King more level in the rising. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2784.86s)]
*  So that was a title title fight in the rising. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2790.54s)]
*  And it's about the feeling the opponent the field opponent but not be but to not be how [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2795.42s)]
*  say do not let this feeling to to to push you in some way you know in a sense to to [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2807.3399999999997s)]
*  feel the space but still be calm be unshakable and you can feel the then you can feel the [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2820.74s)]
*  space around you the everything and whatever will move right now you will react for that [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2833.9399999999996s)]
*  and and naturally because you will feel the these all these things like yours like yourself [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2839.8199999999997s)]
*  like everything is you and then then you can step to the level I'm everywhere because there [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2850.54s)]
*  is no difference between me this this thing this thing the opponent but still but still [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2858.14s)]
*  and that's sometimes why I need to be why I need to be a little bit hit to feel the [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2865.8599999999997s)]
*  aggression back to the fight that was that was before the before the UFC and I need I [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2871.2999999999997s)]

*  felt the right right movement everything was right but I also needed to be more aggressive [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2885.74s)]
*  to once it's to go through the opponent yeah because I was too how to say too nice too [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2893.4599999999996s)]

*  but something in the middle still control that it's all about control balance yeah I [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2936.14s)]
*  like what you said like that there's no difference between you and your opponent [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2940.7s)]
*  like you're not even you just in this flow of movement and life in this thing you're [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=2944.8199999999997s)]

*  the of the of the comfort life of the of the people because like that you can have the food [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3289.7s)]

*  same word same attitude before the fight in the preparation and after the fight in the fight [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3667.8599999999997s)]
*  after the fight all the time like the same that's me yeah and I want to show me not me before and me [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3675.62s)]
*  after right there's a lot of guys just for the sake of promotion they talk a lot of shit and [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3683.22s)]
*  they're just trying to stir things up and make the fight more exciting by insulting people insulting [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3691.22s)]
*  their families yeah and it gets it gets very ugly and I think the audience turns on them over that [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3696.02s)]
*  and one of the things that's shown with your success and your popularity and guys like alex [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3702.58s)]
*  is that you don't even have to speak english like it doesn't matter if you kick ass I mean if it [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3709.2999999999997s)]
*  doesn't matter you could talk all the shit you want get everything hyped up what really matters [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3714.2599999999998s)]
*  is how you perform inside the octagon when you perform inside the octagon like alex has like you [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3719.8599999999997s)]
*  have it doesn't there's no need for shit talking it's you people love you and they love you just [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3725.3799999999997s)]
*  by the style of your fighting and you're expressing your soul inside that cage like who you are as a [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3731.7s)]
*  man inside that cage you don't have to talk shit about someone's wife or all that crap yeah that's [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3739.14s)]
*  that's why many people around me like the my manager team try to be more more focused for [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3744.42s)]
*  uh a promo and all these things and man the fight will do the promo this is the main thing of [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3753.54s)]
*  everything yeah not selling these things these things these these giving the [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3761.7799999999997s)]
*  the main thing is the [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3769.06s)]
*  the fight the performance the performance that's what kind of drives me crazy about um [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3772.8199999999997s)]
*  when championship level fighters have to do a lot of promotion before the fight I'm like man leave [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3778.98s)]
*  that guy alone what's really important is how he's going to perform if you want to promote it have a [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3783.7799999999997s)]
*  bunch of people like me or you know Daniel Cormier or Chael Sonnen have people talk about the [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3789.06s)]
*  fight you hype the fight up you don't have to bother this guy at seven o'clock in the morning [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3794.18s)]
*  and talk to him for an hour about some fucking nonsense that's what I like leave him alone yeah [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3798.66s)]
*  that's what I like on UFC they are focused for performance that's great every time and no talking [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3802.58s)]
*  before no one fight other fight no special promo before the like afterwards do interviews like [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3808.2599999999998s)]
*  right now afterwards relax but when leading up to the fight the most important thing is that you're [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3816.1s)]
*  100 prepared and anything that distracts from that should be eliminated that's right that's right [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3822.18s)]
*  that's right and yeah and many many many fighters are yeah we are like focused for [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3827.94s)]
*  yeah still there are things about shit talking that I do like and what I do like is that [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3835.7s)]
*  yeah first of all it gets a lot of people excited about it which makes me happy because I want more [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3842.1s)]
*  people to watch the sport but also there's a psychological aspect especially Conor McGregor [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3847.06s)]
*  he's so good at talking shit that he gets people so angry that like when he fought Jose Aldo for [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3853.7799999999997s)]
*  instance like no one had ever treated Jose Aldo anyway other than with respect he was one of the [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3860.58s)]
*  greatest champions he's an elite fighter he defended his title multiple times destroyed his [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3866.5s)]
*  division yes but you could tell that all that shit talking from Conor had an effect on him [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3872.74s)]
*  emotionally and I think his ego made him go out of line so he ran right at Conor and tried to hit [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3877.94s)]
*  him and Conor stepped back and cracked him he was so energetic so now imagine if instead if Jose Aldo [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3884.1s)]
*  fought that fight and dragged it into the fourth and fifth round yep and started using the leg [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3892.74s)]
*  kicks that he used on Uriah Faber and started like picking apart from be careful in the beginning [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3898.8199999999997s)]
*  but stay inside the game plan stay inside fight the best of your ability don't get emotional and [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3904.1s)]
*  that could have been a very different fight that's right but that's the weapon the weapon of shit [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3910.3399999999997s)]
*  talking yeah and especially if you know how to use that oh yeah he uses it better than anybody he [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=3913.8599999999997s)]

*  bullshit and that's how you perform at your best so after a fight like this there was a lot of [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4164.5s)]
*  space and this is i brought back to the luke thomas video he was saying like you could be [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4170.42s)]
*  the middleweight champion like if you made 20 you fought at 208 like that's a lot lighter probably [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4174.82s)]
*  than drekas duplassie yeah drekas is huge i look at him i was like how does drekas make 185 he's so [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4180.82s)]
*  big yep have you thought about that i know there was some talk about that at one point in time [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4187.38s)]
*  yes i thought i thought about that but the main thing for me is right now i see the way [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4192.74s)]
*  in light heavyweight because i'm this one of the strongest guy in in in this division [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4201.14s)]
*  and i still feel like there is a way in uh in light heavyweight and i said to myself like [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4209.06s)]
*  okay you can go to the middleweight but first show the consistency in light heavyweight [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4217.38s)]
*  take a belt then you can with a belt from light heavyweight you can fight for the belt from [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4225.3s)]
*  for middleweight in the middleweight to be a double champion yeah so yeah well you know it's [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4231.54s)]
*  interesting because weight cutting is in my opinion the worst aspect of the sport josh barnett was just [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4238.34s)]
*  talking about this he was on the ariel hawani show and he was talking about the dangers of [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4246.1s)]
*  weight cutting in reference to arman sorokian's uh having to pull out of that fight arman is big [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4249.700000000001s)]
*  he's big when i stand next to him i cannot believe he makes 155 he's very muscular very dense and very [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4256.58s)]
*  lean and so for him to make 155 it must be an absolutely brutal weight cut i gotta think he [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4264.1s)]
*  weighs 180 easy maybe more you know he's big and i think off when he's out of camp i bet he weighs [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4270.5s)]
*  closer to 200 i mean he's fucking thick man why so for a guy like that why do you do that why do you [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4277.46s)]
*  don't fighting in uh in in uh in a higher weight class in a higher weight class well the thing is [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4283.22s)]
*  at that weight class islam makachev is so fucking good and he's so big he's another one you stand [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4291.7s)]
*  next to him you're like how the fuck does this guy make 170 and he was actually talking about [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4300.1s)]
*  his first fight with alexander volkonovsky and one of the problems that he faced was that the [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4304.42s)]
*  fight was very early australia time so that it could be on pay-per-view in america so he was [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4309.9400000000005s)]
*  getting ready at 5 a.m so he did not have the time to recover from the weight cut from the previous [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4315.700000000001s)]
*  day okay so instead of having a full 24 plus hours so if you're weighing in at 10 o'clock in the [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4321.54s)]
*  morning now is it what time do you weigh in what time did you weigh in in los angeles eight eight [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4328.58s)]
*  in the morning okay so eight in the morning and then you have a full 36 hours plus before you [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4333.22s)]
*  fight that's right which is plenty of time to recover and rehydrate but he did not get that [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4339.14s)]
*  with the volkonovsky fight and you saw it in his performance he didn't look as good okay and because [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4343.3s)]
*  he's fucking big man yeah so he's i think weight cutting should be eliminated i said this to aria [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4347.78s)]
*  manual when they first bought the ufc i said listen man you know what you do get rid of weight cutting [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4353.62s)]
*  to stop it it's not look if you can randomly test people for drugs you can randomly test their weight [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4358.26s)]
*  show up with a scale hey buddy step on scale you're 190 pounds how the fuck are you making 145 [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4364.74s)]
*  you know like do something like that that's right and come up with more weight classes there should [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4370.5s)]
*  be a weight class every 10 pounds this idea of these giant gaps like 185 to 205 that's a 20 pound [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4375.22s)]
*  huge that doesn't exist in boxing they should have every 10 pounds 85 95 205 225 and then unlimited [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4383.14s)]
*  instead of 265 let them weigh whatever the fuck they weigh yeah these got giant guys out there [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4391.46s)]
*  that can't fight in the ufc because they can't make 265 which is kind of crazy yeah right like [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4396.18s)]
*  bigfoot bigfoot silver when he was at his prime when he was when he was saucy he was like 300 [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4400.82s)]
*  pounds it was fucking huge so i like the way the open weights man yeah yeah open weight not 265 [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4405.54s)]
*  let francis and gana weigh whatever the fuck he weighs when he doesn't cut weight probably weighs [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4412.74s)]
*  like 290 instead of having weight cuts just take the champions find out what the champion weighs [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4416.34s)]
*  like don't get rid of the championship belts find out what is islam makachev weight islam makachev is [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4425.14s)]
*  a ufc champion best pound for pound fighter on earth find out what he weighs what do you weigh [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4431.14s)]
*  if you were healthy if weight cutting didn't exist would it be 185 okay 190 whatever that is [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4436.66s)]
*  that's how you fight now and we're not going to weigh you in the day before and let you rehydrate [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4443.46s)]
*  that's crazy talk fight people your size and and also the fights would be better because too many [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4448.82s)]
*  guys get depleted horribly by these weight like max holloway said he would never make 150 145 [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4456.26s)]
*  again after i fought ilia topoya so i can't do it anymore because he had gone up to 55 he got [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4462.74s)]
*  thicker and then he went back to 45 he's just drained he just wasn't himself he didn't look good [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4467.7s)]
*  so i think that would be and i know this is not an easy thing to do but i do think it's just like [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4472.98s)]
*  getting steroids out of fighting when they brought in usada when usada came in you saw people's [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4480.58s)]
*  physiques melt you saw people that were doing steroids on a regular basis and gaming the system [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4486.26s)]
*  and testing negative on the day of the fight but all throughout their camp they were using [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4492.0199999999995s)]
*  you saw their bodies change they started looking like doughy and flabby because they didn't have [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4496.58s)]
*  any testosterone anymore because they've fucked up their endocrine systems instead of allowing [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4502.0199999999995s)]
*  that they brought in usada and usada started randomly testing and a lot of people fell off [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4507.86s)]
*  great champions fell off guys like vitor belford fell off great great fighters who when they were [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4513.54s)]
*  using were unbelievably good but then as soon as they had to be natural okay so we realized that [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4519.78s)]
*  we're gonna have to sacrifice some fighters for that this is the same approach that should be made [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4525.139999999999s)]
*  with weight cutting weight cutting should not exist it's terrible for you it's unnecessary it's [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4530.259999999999s)]
*  not necessary it's just sanctioned cheating that we've done forever if you're telling me that alex [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4537.139999999999s)]
*  perera when he fought is there a lot of sanya he weighed 185 one day and 226 the next day [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4544.42s)]
*  that's crazy that's crazy it's crazy that's it's not a slight against alex because alex is willing [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4552.42s)]
*  to fight heavyweight he's willing to fight to what he weighs it should weight cutting is something [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4559.62s)]
*  that exists it's it's sanctioned they allow it to happen they know what's going on and it's cheating [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4564.1s)]
*  that's right they're not really 170 pounds that guy's 195 he's depleted and dried out and then [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4570.26s)]
*  he's gonna swell back up again and he's gonna look huge the next day like trickus everything is [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4576.66s)]
*  evolving so yes they should evolve that because for the safety of the fighters for the safety of [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4581.780000000001s)]
*  the fighters it's not good to dehydrate your brain 24 hours before a cage fight that's right it's [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4587.38s)]
*  dumb yeah but nobody's gonna listen to me nobody listens to me yuri nobody maybe after this yeah [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4593.860000000001s)]
*  i don't think they should even have cages i think it should be an open floor i think it should be an [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4599.38s)]
*  open floor like a basketball court yeah because i think it was the best yeah the cage allows you [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4604.58s)]
*  to get up when you wouldn't ordinarily be able to get up you could walk wall walk get the cage [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4609.46s)]
*  allows someone to press you up against an unnatural object there's a cage there so you can press a guy [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4614.5s)]
*  up against a cage whereas if you were standing in the center you could do muay thai sweeps you could [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4620.74s)]
*  rotate around each other there'd be more action there's more movement that's right i also think [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4626.26s)]
*  if someone takes you down at the beginning of the first round at the end of the round you're on your [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4630.900000000001s)]
*  back you start that second round in the same position yeah you see that like uh yeah i i have [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4634.900000000001s)]
*  the similar similar riff of the of the fighting first i thought like where why there is a rules [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4641.46s)]
*  why there is a the eye gouging i i i pokes is not allowed so i'm glad for after this last fight [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4649.3s)]
*  it's not allowed it shouldn't be allowed but it's very effective man yeah but yeah show all your [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4658.740000000001s)]
*  weapon of your body how you can defeat this man that's all one against one that's all yes one [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4666.66s)]

*  they should do and i'm going to talk to dana about this this week cover the fingers there's no reason [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4679.06s)]
*  to have these fingers exposed it doesn't help anything it doesn't help grappling you never [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4683.860000000001s)]
*  grapple like this right you never you never use the finger no no nobody does you do this yes or [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4687.780000000001s)]
*  you do this yes or you do different things with your hands but your fingers but still the feeling [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4693.780000000001s)]
*  still the feeling i understand but the problem is the pokes because everybody does this because you're [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4699.700000000001s)]
*  used to sparring with gloves on so i love the eye pokes man everybody you will you know what will [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4704.34s)]
*  what will happen everybody will be more prepared for for i know for no for iphone for every possible [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4711.78s)]
*  attack for an eye because eyes is the weapon too for my especially especially i can i can speak [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4720.900000000001s)]
*  about that because i'm using that like uh i see so i know what you're saying maybe maybe it's weird [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4728.1s)]
*  yeah the problem is you don't want people to go blind like michael bissping can't see out of his [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4735.620000000001s)]
*  right eye yep you know and that i just i feel like for the sake of the athlete's future everybody [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4740.18s)]
*  will took every fucking sorry every every every fight every fight so seriously so preparation will [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4746.02s)]
*  be so and every uh people in the crowd will watch that with the man in this fight there can happen [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4755.14s)]
*  something what after that fight we will not can nobody can change right right so we will [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4766.02s)]
*  like the fighters we will uh speak better uh perform better train better be prepared to die [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4773.46s)]
*  right and not like uh just in our mind just to die to show the best performance like like um i mean [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4784.5s)]
*  that like philosophically like uh you have to stop thinking and be in the moment and all the all these [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4795.06s)]
*  right but like but that's what that's we are right now speaking like about [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4802.26s)]
*  ancient fights like about the fight fight for a life real fight yeah real no rules at all do [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4812.34s)]
*  you think maybe get rid of cups too and allow kicks of the balls that's real it's a real target [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4818.58s)]
*  it's a vulnerability of the human body to ignore vulnerabilities of the human body it sounds weird [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4825.139999999999s)]
*  especially in this age of the full of laws and all these things yeah but that's that's how i [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4830.58s)]
*  hum how i see that we are living in the age where the laws is work laws and the system yeah is [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4838.82s)]
*  working so we put the we have to put some some system on the fighting too right so eddie bravo [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4846.82s)]
*  actually came up with an idea it was he was joking around but he wanted to call it ultimate sack [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4855.86s)]
*  fighting where uh you were allowed to kick a guy on the balls and that your balls would be exposed [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4860.259999999999s)]
*  so it was like when the balls are in play the game changes and then the idea was that like your balls [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4866.98s)]
*  are so vulnerable but yet you cover them like a tie cup you know yeah and that if he didn't if the [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4871.78s)]
*  balls were hanging out like your you know your chin is hanging out that it would change everything [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4877.299999999999s)]
*  yeah he was just joking around it was very funny that the guy who would win would just have [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4881.299999999999s)]
*  like iron balls yeah but nobody has iron balls i mean the human body has the the eye pokes and [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4885.38s)]
*  ball shots you didn't see vulnerabilities you didn't saw the the the monks yeah how they how [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4893.7s)]
*  they kicking yeah i don't understand that i think they're just hitting each other in the taint [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4900.18s)]
*  i think their balls are tucked up i think otherwise it doesn't make any sense that you [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4905.06s)]
*  could just slam your foot because also the way they're doing it the monks they're kicking up [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4909.06s)]
*  they're kicking up so i think they're just slamming their shit into the in step into the taint [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4913.94s)]
*  yes it's not really the balls man like if you front kick that monk in the balls just front [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4918.099999999999s)]
*  snap front it would fall down dead he'd be like ah what happened i thought you had iron balls [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4923.0599999999995s)]
*  nobody has iron balls nobody has iron eyeballs either you know that's the problem with eyeballs [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4929.86s)]
*  is yeah these guys yeah see how he's doing that yeah he's getting kicked he's getting [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4934.5s)]
*  the middle yeah yeah he's getting kicked in the taint his balls i can even see the way his sack [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4939.38s)]
*  has pulled up see that little thing that he's got on there but still he's right yeah he probably [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4943.78s)]
*  has little balls too unfortunately it's stupid either way that's stupid that doesn't it doesn't [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4948.74s)]
*  if that was the only way like if you could train that way and you know like a lot of the ties they [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4955.7s)]
*  kick banana trees and kick sandbags you know we have a sandbag out there it's so brutal to kick [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4960.74s)]
*  but if you do that enough you'll develop those micro fractures on your shins and it'll make your [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4966.26s)]
*  shins much tougher you can't make your balls tougher you can't make your balls tougher [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4970.5s)]
*  yeah i think there is no no uh no reason just punched himself in the dick reason to [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4975.3s)]
*  this is so ridiculous this is so ridiculous this guy's you just take oh no fuck man oh oh no don't [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4984.26s)]
*  do it oh god he's getting slammed the nuts by a log these guys just hit each other the balls [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4992.66s)]
*  but again i think if you step to one of those guys and front snap kicked him right in the balls [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=4999.54s)]
*  and then they'd fall down this is stupid you know what i realized when i saw the like a lot of [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5005.3s)]
*  masters of of a lot of masters of of these kung fu doing these weird stuff and all these things [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5011.7s)]
*  so there is a way to like about obsession of the of the martial arts of the [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5019.94s)]
*  doing something in in your life to the deepest level but still this is a fighting yeah about [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5028.34s)]
*  that this is about the win so i don't know if this will can can will help you to really defeat the [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5036.58s)]
*  no no especially this is just defense yeah okay so you are the preferred prepared to [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5048.26s)]
*  defense your your boss and [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5055.3s)]
*  so man really like think about it like in real don't don't be so don't don't give it too much [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5060.74s)]
*  on these on this side of an art of the like just doing it's good to to know one thing one two [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5068.66s)]
*  right one two really really deeply so you can time that timing that in every situation to know how to [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5079.22s)]
*  what how to do this movement in every situation but these movements they're not an effective use [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5088.5s)]
*  of your time yes yeah it's not going to help you be a better fighter it's there's a lot of ancient [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5095.06s)]
*  movements that are probably good for the development of your consciousness and they're [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5100.42s)]
*  probably good overall for your ability to be a better martial artist because they teach you [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5104.660000000001s)]
*  certain movements which are almost like a form like kata a lot of people talk about forms and [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5109.780000000001s)]
*  they say it's a waste of time but i think it's a moving meditation i used to think it was a [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5115.38s)]
*  waste of time when i was a young man everything is when i got my black belt i just learned the [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5119.860000000001s)]
*  katas and then afterwards i forgot them as soon as i just learned them so that i could pass the next [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5124.0199999999995s)]
*  test and then once i knew all the forms and the katas i didn't care anymore i just wanted to fight [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5129.46s)]
*  so like yeah but all these moves they're important are written in in your in your body in yes maybe [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5134.5s)]
*  maybe you don't realize that yet but in the hardest situation in uh maybe there will one move will [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5141.139999999999s)]
*  wow will will jump up and bomb because you've trained your system you've trained your system [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5151.0599999999995s)]
*  with those things like the neo in the matrix man yeah i know the kung fu i know yeah yeah they [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5156.34s)]
*  think they're going to be able to do that now this is a day i was just reading an article about that [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5161.62s)]
*  and they were comparing it to neo in the matrix they think they're going to be able to download [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5166.099999999999s)]
*  skills into people's brains man it's uh what sucks this is no it sucks because it's i want [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5170.26s)]
*  them to learn the way you learned i think no man there is a the ego the force the force we will do [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5177.14s)]
*  that by i will take it and this there it is me demetri yeah that's demetri hey demetri hey [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5185.06s)]
*  and instead of like to take a take a find a real snake and whatever i i i cannot describe describe [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5194.1s)]
*  on the snake so i know what you're saying like train those movements so when the punch comes [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5203.78s)]
*  you block you counter and then that it's in your mind [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5209.46s)]
*  you will take some information and by the force you will give it in in yourself yeah to uh i don't [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5215.54s)]
*  know which which form you you meant like like the way they're like the matrix we spoke let's uh let's [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5223.14s)]
*  google that because they were jamie will find the article um maybe like i must have that uh [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5229.94s)]
*  neurolink i don't think or something like that i don't think it was that invasive i think it was [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5236.74s)]
*  it was some other technology that they think they're going to be able to utilize scientists [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5242.099999999999s)]
*  use matrix style learning to write skills into human brains see non-invasively so they don't [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5246.66s)]
*  have to inject anything okay put up okay okay a wire in your brain techniques use real-time [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5252.66s)]
*  brain imagery in neurofeedback it bypasses learning processes that require effort study [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5258.82s)]
*  or practice with our method not only can we nudge complex patterns around in the brain towards known [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5264.66s)]
*  ones but also for the first time write directly a new pattern into the brain and measure what [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5270.5s)]
*  effect that has on a person's behavior said dr coraline lorden lead author of the study [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5276.9s)]
*  an assistant professor of brain and cognitive sciences at the university of rochester [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5282.66s)]
*  that's crazy okay and this is this is the one one side the second side how i'm how i'm looking at [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5287.46s)]

*  know how it's working but it's working to be just connected for all the information what's [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5315.94s)]
*  whatever happened and will happen is there in this moment right here right now and [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5324.58s)]

*  responsibility yeah big responsibility because if you don't know how to work with the gun it can be [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5613.94s)]
*  dangerous right yeah so right right right yeah with great power comes great responsibility [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5621.7s)]
*  yeah where um you you sit right now at the top of the heap like uh after ankalev especially after [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5628.179999999999s)]
*  that performance it's very likely that either you or a lot of people are forgetting about jan [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5636.74s)]
*  bohovich always like to give him his props because jan bohovich is still one of the best fighters in [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5642.74s)]
*  the world and i would like to see him get another shot because he's also 41 or 42 i think now [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5647.78s)]
*  yep and you know he doesn't have much time left in his prime yep and jan is maintained like even [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5653.38s)]
*  at 40 years old still yeah doesn't show any signs of deterioration that's right man um when i thought [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5659.38s)]
*  about opponent my next opponents there was just like these guys uh ankalev perera the perera [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5665.94s)]
*  most but let's see how the negotiations will be the perera ankalev and maybe the bakovic so these [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5674.74s)]
*  three guys i see still there i see the uh challenge yes the challenge because i want to go [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5683.7s)]
*  somewhere where i will feel i can because every time when when there is a challenge there is a new [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5693.139999999999s)]
*  you and there is a new something new what you need to overcome what you need to rule what you need to [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5701.46s)]
*  which you need to observe yes yeah they're the elite level of the game yeah you know jan [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5711.7s)]
*  bohovich he's one of the i think the only gods to go the distance with perera other than bruno silva [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5716.82s)]
*  right yeah because he has the hands up also that guy's made out of iron i mean i never forget the [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5723.78s)]
*  fight with ankalev when he was just going shin to shin with ankalev and ankalev could barely walk [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5731.06s)]
*  jan bohovich is made out of rocks man that dude man i thought like he won that fight but very close [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5736.1s)]
*  very close fight but you could definitely see giving it to jan bohovich there's a lot of those [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5742.1s)]
*  fights here's another thing that i think should happen in the ufc i think we need more than three [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5747.620000000001s)]
*  judges i don't even think that the judges some judges are very good i think the judging in [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5751.22s)]
*  california was very good i think uh overall i think we need at least five judges i think three [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5756.58s)]
*  is too little i think we need because there's too many times where two judges get it wrong [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5763.7s)]
*  and the crowd is like what the fuck i think if you had five judges then you have two judges that [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5767.7s)]
*  would counterbalance that other and there'd be three two in the right direction and you would [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5773.22s)]
*  get a good result okay i think you're more likely to get a good result an accurate result of what [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5776.82s)]
*  the fans and the experts see about the result of a fight than you would if there was only three [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5781.86s)]
*  judges or fighting to win yeah fighting to win well that that's the i mean what gordon likes to [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5787.86s)]
*  do gordon ryan likes to do is no uh no time limit fights he does no time limit fights with uh no [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5793.62s)]
*  points like listen we're going to submission this is what this game is about it's a bit me strangling [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5800.58s)]
*  you that's right yeah yeah yeah imagine that if they started doing the ufc like the old ufc [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5805.139999999999s)]
*  like ufc one no rules maybe for somebody it will be a little bit uh like they will not like it [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5810.1s)]
*  because it will be maybe sometimes it will be long maybe but maybe so what yeah yeah that's fighting [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5816.58s)]
*  yeah that's fighting people watch baseball yeah no no offense against baseball but that shit's boring [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5823.46s)]
*  as fuck compared to fighting you you know what's my theory about that so there is a sports a lot of [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5828.900000000001s)]
*  sports but the first one first sport first uh [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5835.22s)]
*  uh fuck first version of sports for the reason of version of sport was like one man wants to [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5842.58s)]
*  overcome the second man yes and it comes from [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5849.780000000001s)]
*  dna from from dna from fight from fight for these a piece of cavemen for food from food fighting [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5855.54s)]
*  predators yeah this is this this that's why it came from and in the in the in the time there was [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5864.42s)]
*  like let's let's do some other another competition another competition right to not be so violent so [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5871.14s)]
*  violent but then to be honest the realest one competition is the one man against the second man [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5880.9s)]
*  that's why that sport translates through all languages is the only sport that translates [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5889.94s)]
*  like cricket cricket is huge in other parts of the world nobody watches cricket in america in other [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5895.62s)]
*  parts of the world billions of people watch cricket nobody gives a fuck about cricket here put cricket [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5901.62s)]
*  on tv you'll no one's gonna watch and we in a time we gave the some rules the kimonos the all these [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5906.099999999999s)]
*  things no let's well that was the beauty of the first ufc the first ufc was just wild no weight [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5914.0199999999995s)]
*  classes no no no real rules other than ipods you there's a there's a there's a joe um joe [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5921.54s)]
*  san was fighting keith hackney and keith hackney was uh caught in a guillotine and he's just [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5929.78s)]
*  punching joe san in the balls it's a famous scene yeah yeah yeah do you remember that i saw that [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5936.259999999999s)]
*  it was like i remember watching that going oh this is awful this is awful there's another one [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5942.099999999999s)]
*  in brazil big daddy goodrich was fighting this guy named the the pager look at this just pure [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5949.7s)]
*  nut shots just one after the other right to the balls this was horrible to watch show me the [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5956.0199999999995s)]
*  monk training but here's the thing if he's wearing a cup especially if he's wearing a tie cup a steel [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5962.58s)]
*  cup which i also think should be illegal i don't think you should have steel cups because steel [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5967.62s)]
*  cups act as a leverage point as well okay you know not only you could break your foot on it [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5972.34s)]
*  it's an unnatural object and then if you get someone an armbar with a steel cup yeah you could [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5976.9s)]
*  break it it's like it's like it's an extra leverage point like it's like bending a stick over a rock [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5981.78s)]
*  use it like a weapon yeah and you kenny flooring used to always fight with a tie steel cup he's [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5986.9s)]
*  like i don't know why anybody would fight with anything else because it hurts them when they [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5991.54s)]
*  kick me yeah yeah and it really is like a good leverage point it's also good for the mount if [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5994.5s)]
*  somebody mounts you there was a guy that i used to train with a mere renovati and he used to get on [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=5999.7s)]
*  top of you and mount you and drive his cup he just drive his dick in your solar plexus and you'd want [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6004.26s)]
*  to tap it was horrible but it was smart i mean if it's legal it's a smart thing find a way between [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6009.94s)]
*  the laws imagine if nobody had cups if cups were illegal there'd be so much more nut shots you know [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6017.62s)]
*  maybe somebody will find a way how to jump with the these couple to do a face like those guys [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6023.86s)]
*  i don't think so i don't think that's real i don't think that would work but other than that the you [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6030.179999999999s)]
*  know the rules uh they're pretty good they're getting a little bit better i'd like knees on [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6035.94s)]
*  the ground as well knees to the head i don't think a opponent should be allowed to be in a turtle [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6039.86s)]
*  when your head is vulnerable you have to move you have to avoid those knees and that's a like [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6044.179999999999s)]
*  before my last fight right now uh the the ref referee uh sorry i didn't with the big mustache [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6048.5s)]
*  oh mike beltron mike belch yes sorry mike beltron because he's a good guy and uh [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6057.46s)]
*  he tried to uh to tell me like how to when because i didn't know that the change of the rules the [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6064.98s)]
*  change of the rules like when the hands down right when it's not the when it's not the elbow [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6073.14s)]
*  when the hands down and you're staying and the legs and hands down you can knee the opponent [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6078.42s)]
*  to the head yes still yes man that's that's better that's better much better much better [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6084.42s)]
*  because guys were gaming the system they put a hand down so they couldn't get need in the face [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6089.700000000001s)]
*  that's crazy yeah that doesn't make any sense you should not be doing that yeah that that's a good [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6093.3s)]
*  rule that they changed another rule is the 12 to 6 elbow that should be legal and now that's legal [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6098.02s)]
*  again that's the only reason for john jones ever having a loss you know so there's there's good [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6102.58s)]
*  movement on the rules rise and allow uh knees to the head to a grounded opponent and kicking yeah [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6108.74s)]
*  did you get accustomed to that and have to like get that out of your system when you came to the [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6114.74s)]
*  ufc is there any moments where you like thought about throwing a soccer no no i didn't thought [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6118.58s)]
*  about that but um when you are still when you are in the control in in the fighting what's the i [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6122.74s)]
*  think the the biggest biggest thing in the fighter in the fighting to to to stay in in the control [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6129.38s)]
*  so you know what to do what can't to do and but some there's a moments when you don't [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6137.9400000000005s)]
*  don't control yourself too much so so it's dangerous but in raising i used that i did that [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6145.78s)]
*  like i think i twice yeah yeah it's very effective it should be allowed yeah i think it should be [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6152.74s)]
*  allowed i think the only problem with soccer kicks is the cage so the cage if your head is [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6158.66s)]
*  right there and you get stomped you can't move yep yep so this it's the unnatural barrier of the [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6164.34s)]
*  cage that's the problem that's why i think basketball court yeah matted down basketball court [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6169.38s)]
*  that's just two men in the center of it have a warning track yes you go outside the warning [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6175.3s)]
*  track too many times you lose points yeah because you're trying to avoid the fight plenty of movement [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6180.5s)]
*  yeah plenty of time to and if someone gets you down i was just trying to get it right to imagine [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6185.3s)]
*  that and it's it's better it's good it's much better yeah it's better because you wouldn't be [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6190.02s)]
*  able to just stall the fight out by holding someone against the cage yes sometimes when fighters are [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6194.18s)]
*  exhausted they'll just clinch against the cage try to catch their breath that wouldn't be allowed [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6198.42s)]
*  you couldn't do it there would be no opportunity to do that that's right that's right also if you got [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6203.22s)]
*  taken down you'd have to get up with skill you can't just use the cage to get up it's very hard [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6207.46s)]
*  especially if you got a great wrestler like islam on top of you very hard to get up any other way [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6212.34s)]
*  than wall walking yeah just right now i'm thinking about it i think about about uh how's the name of [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6218.18s)]

*  yeah but still how i see that when we are going higher in understanding everything we have to go [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6263.94s)]
*  maybe i'm wrong deeper in in the in the these raw things we want to see more raw because to be not [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6274.9s)]

*  i don't even have to ask but the book of five rings he talks about that because miyamoto [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6299.78s)]
*  musashi was such a great sword fighter that he he believed the only way to fight at your best is [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6304.1s)]
*  you have to be a balanced person very balanced you have to be an artist you have to be able to do [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6309.14s)]
*  calligraphy and write poetry you can't just be aggression you have to be completely balanced [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6314.02s)]
*  and he believed in that so strongly and taught that so strongly in the book of five rings that [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6319.46s)]
*  if you if you think about how he applied it to sword fighting it makes sense everything what [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6324.82s)]
*  you're saying makes sense because you have to be completely pure when it's just two men and and [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=6330.66s)]

*  you think he was using black magic yeah it's every time uh a big uh no big difference [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7033.94s)]
*  uh experience uh i said that that world big power when you are responsibility it's big [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7047.14s)]

*  don't want to speak about that fully because still it is it is something what i am humble for and [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7064.74s)]
*  and i can say this is it this is it yeah too because everyone everyone have has the their [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7072.1s)]
*  own way and nobody is like even me prepared for just saying uh some something what what can be [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7084.26s)]
*  for somebody like take it seriously you know you know maybe yeah again i get lost in that so [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7100.26s)]
*  the thing is [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7110.42s)]
*  i just started to believe i will not speak about where is the magic what how to use the magic but [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7114.02s)]
*  you believed that there was magic working against you man i and that was the that was the biggest [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7121.54s)]
*  power to my for my opponent because i was focused for him not for me you know and that's where the [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7128.66s)]
*  black magic lies and then because it gets you outside of your own head is that that is that [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7136.66s)]
*  black magic or is that just his presence as a champion because that's the the aura of a fighter [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7141.62s)]
*  is a weapon he have israel adesanya when he was in his prime yes mike tyson in his prime had that [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7148.26s)]
*  there's anderson silva had that there's an aura that champions have when they're in their prime [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7154.02s)]
*  that makes you think about them instead of yourself and it probably seems like black magic yeah but [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7158.740000000001s)]
*  still this is the just for me is the pure self-confidence and to be pure self-confident [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7163.9400000000005s)]
*  you you can't think about your opponent and that was the that was something what i made that was [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7174.820000000001s)]
*  something what i really went to another level yeah yeah so when you look at yourself now in [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7182.26s)]
*  this amazing performance against jamal hill do you are you imagining yourself even better [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM&t=7192.34s)]
