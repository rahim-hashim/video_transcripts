# Joe Rogan Experience #1504 - Alan Levinovitz
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOxxzOhZyg)
*  Hello, Alan. Hello, Joe. Good to see you. First of all, thank you for this. This piece
*  of pyrite that's embedded into stone. And we just started talking. I said, just don't
*  say another word. Let's start talking about this on the podcast because this, it kind
*  of it's interesting. I started your book, which I very rarely read books. I mostly do
*  audio books, but I was forced to read yours. But one of the things that I found interesting
*  is the concept of what is natural. And I've gone over this many times myself. I'm like,
*  poison's natural. Like everything's natural. Computers are natural really because they
*  come from the ground. They're made by people. They're essentially like, you know, a human's
*  version of anything like a bird would create, right? Birds create birds nests. Are those
*  natural? But this pyrite, this is pyrite, right? Yep. Which is fool's gold, right? Fool's
*  But it's naturally in these cubes, in this square form, this perfect, these perfect angles,
*  which you would never believe. You would think somebody left this shit there. I didn't believe
*  it. It looks like, it looks like aliens left them. Yeah. And they're even in like what
*  that's called is it's in the matrix. Oh, wow. So sometimes you can just get the cubes. They're
*  just the cube, but they call the rock that it's in the matrix, which I think is kind
*  of appropriate. That is going to have a permanent spot on this desk with all this other craziness
*  there. Thank you so much. That was really cool. I did not know that it came like that.
*  I found pyrite when I was a kid in rocks, you know, when they call it fool's gold. Jamie's
*  going to bring that up to you there. Fool's gold, but it's, you know, it's usually like
*  specks and flecks and stuff. There's another one called, I forget, they're called like
*  Illinois miners dollars or something. This is another form that pyrite takes. I'm kind
*  of obsessed with weird rocks, but they look just like sand dollars, but they're gold.
*  They look like they're golden. And so these are, you know, I think one of the things I
*  actually changed my mind over writing, like over the course of writing this book. Oh,
*  there they are. Jamie pull up some. Yeah, that's crazy. They're incredible, right? What
*  causes it to take on these different, completely unusual forms? So I tried, I tried to find
*  out there's like a local rock store where I live and I asked the guy and apparently
*  I don't understand how it works at all. But the way all crystals work is they have different
*  kinds of structures and the way those structures come together determines whether you know
*  it makes like a quartz crystal or what shape it takes. It's very, it's very surreal.
*  Yeah, it's very surreal. This is very bizarre. I did not know until you gave this to me that
*  that existed. Yeah. And this is so like for me, I went into this book, like you said,
*  right? With this question of what's natural. There's some people like often scientists
*  who will sort of scoff at the idea of naturalness, right? They're like, everything's natural,
*  right? Humans are natural. We're animals. We made all this stuff. We made the microphones.
*  We're all made out of space dust. Everything's natural. It's stupid to distinguish between
*  natural and unnatural. And honestly, that's where I was when I started writing the book.
*  I was like, I'm going to make, I'm going to show this as a stupid idea. I'm going to,
*  I'm going to be Richard Dawkins, but for naturalness. Right. But I was wrong. I don't
*  know. What shifted it for you? Well, so one of the things like with that pirate, right?
*  People ask, is it natural? That's the first thing they ask. Does this occur naturally?
*  Right. And it's an important question because there's a difference, like a sort of profound
*  difference between knowing that that was just spewed up by the earth forces that are not human,
*  right? Versus humans sitting down and deciding to make a cube, right? It's like a diamond that,
*  that has been shaped by millions of years of natural forces. And what I realized is that it
*  really does make sense to distinguish between naturalness and unnaturalness. You have to,
*  maybe it's a spectrum, obviously, right? So it's not an easy binary, but New York City is not as
*  natural as Yellowstone. Right. And what I realized was I wasn't really against the idea of naturalness
*  or even valuing nature, right? I mean, we'll talk, hopefully we'll talk about, I went back country
*  in Yellowstone. It was unbelievable. You know, I mean, everyone values naturalness in certain ways.
*  It was worshiping nature that I had a problem with this idea that the more natural something is,
*  the better it is, or that what we need to do, like if you want to raise your kid, right,
*  you got to raise your kid naturally. You like, you know, let them piss in the corner or like
*  elimination communication. Do you know about this? No. I swear. So, so I think so some,
*  some celebrities have been into like Alicia Silverstone's, uh, did it with her son, Bear.
*  And, uh, isn't it funny that that automatically dismisses it? I call you mean the fact that his
*  name is Bear. No, no, no. Just the fact that it's a celebrity thing. Like celebrities do it. It's
*  like, I dismiss it. Interesting. That's a different, I actually thought it was the name Bear that,
*  but that dismissed it. No, I have a good friend with this who has a son named Bear. I mean,
*  I guess it makes sense if, uh, if, if you're, if you're really obsessed with naturalness,
*  right. And your toilet training your kid, then you don't, you don't want to like be using diapers
*  and you don't want to be using a toilet. You want it to be like nature, right? Like, so when I talked
*  with, uh, with anthropologists who work with hunter gatherers, you know, ask them like, how does,
*  you know, how does potty training work? And they were like, what do you mean? Like people just piss
*  in the forest and, you know, if you, if you take a shit in someone's lap, they're going to be really
*  upset at you. And it doesn't, you know, and then you figure it out. Don't shit in daddy's lap.
*  Exactly. Um, but there's this idea, right? That, that, and so that's how, that's what we should be
*  doing with our children. And, and I don't know about you, but like when I, you know, when we had
*  our daughter, I was online and I'm like, okay, well how do I parent my child? What are the right
*  things to do? Like, should she be in my bed? Should she be in the crib? And time and time again,
*  I always read about how hunter gatherers parented their babies, right? And it was always like, this
*  is the natural way to parent your kid. So it must be better. And, and I realized that was,
*  that was where I had my problem that it's fine to love nature, but you shouldn't worship it.
*  Well, human beings have done horrible things to their children from the beginning of time
*  without anybody telling them to do it or not to do it. And I don't know if that's natural, but yeah,
*  I mean, if it occurs enough, it's kind of like pedophilia occurs a lot. Is that natural?
*  So there was a, there was, yeah, I mean, you know, essentially again, right? If natural is defined as
*  whatever sort of emerges spontaneously out of forces that weren't willed by human beings,
*  which is what I think natural is, right? So we say we have natural instincts. In other words,
*  it's whatever we didn't will, it just comes out of us. There's a, there's a woman who's an expert
*  on captivity. So kidnapping, slavery, and Catherine Cameron. And I was interviewing her. She said,
*  you know, it is as natural as the nuclear family to have slaves, right? So slavery is a thing
*  that has been done forever and ever. I mean, you imagine, right? So you're pre-agricultural,
*  your tribe, your group requires certain population can't get too high, can't get too low. And so
*  kidnapping other people's children, it's often a common thing. So is that good? Well, clearly not,
*  right? Or, you know, dying in childbirth. These are all things that are natural, but obviously
*  not good. And so I started to see the way in which this word was being abused. Basically,
*  people would use natural to describe whatever they favored and unnatural to describe whatever
*  they didn't like, right? People do it with sex, people do it with child rearing, people do it with
*  economic theories, right? You want a natural market with no interference. And that's how people
*  would justify a free market. You've got other people who are like, actually money is unnatural.
*  You really want a barter system. That was what emerged naturally out of humans. And I'm sitting
*  here looking at both of these arguments. I'm like, no, you want an economy that works. Right. It
*  doesn't matter whether it's natural or not. That's a really good point. You know, one of the things
*  that I saw in your book was you were talking to Joel Salatin, who I love. And he's a strange man,
*  but a beautiful person. I really love what he's doing with Polyface Farms, but he drinks the water
*  that the cows drink out of so that he gets that in his biome. You know, he's a real freak. But
*  when you were talking about New York City, and, you know, would his method of farming work to feed
*  a city as big as New York? He's like, do you need a city as big as New York? Then I'm like,
*  okay, hit the brakes. Right now we're in the weeds. Yeah, I love New York. It's fucking great place
*  to visit. I don't want to live there. But it's awesome. I mean, when you go to New York, if you
*  you're if you're in a hotel that has like a 30th floor, and you look out, you see the city's
*  skyscraper, you know, you see all the this, you know, the skyline, all the different beautiful
*  buildings lit up at night. I mean, that is an amazing, spectacular site that I am very
*  thankful exists. I love it there. Yeah, I'm grateful. I'm grateful for all that. I mean,
*  there's so many it's it's it's insane. Really, to be right now, if someone's listening to this
*  podcast, here we are, we've got microphones, we're beaming this conversation to millions of people.
*  And to think that that simultaneously, people would be thinking of themselves the criteria
*  I'm going to use to judge whether something is good or bad with a capital G or a capital B
*  is how natural it is. Right. This is totally unnatural. As unnatural as unnatural as it gets.
*  Meanwhile, the Coronavirus, right, which is, you know, natural, of course, people will say,
*  well, actually, we wouldn't have been infected if only we lived more naturally. Right. So the
*  problem is urban density, or the problem is that you shouldn't be going into the jungle and getting
*  things like this is, you know, there's actually an argument against that, though, the the virus
*  itself, more evidence is coming out daily that it's been manipulated that it most likely did
*  come out of that lab. I had Brett Weinstein on the podcast, who's a biologist. And he was talking
*  about all the various aspects of the virus that really don't exist naturally in in in this form
*  without having evolved for a long period of time, the fact that it just emerged and made this leap
*  from bats to the form that it is now people he's like, it's far too contagious. It's far too
*  prolific. It's there's so many different I'm going to fuck it up if I talk about the technical
*  details of it. But when he was describing it, he was saying more evidence points to the fact that
*  it was actually something that had been manipulated by people than that it was a natural virus.
*  So I mean, I don't I'm not a biologist. I have no idea. But I think what I think what's weird,
*  or what I would want to push back on, and this is a religious studies scholar, right, because this is
*  this is where I came to all the natural, natural stuff to begin with is if something's bad,
*  I think people are immediately going to think, oh, it makes sense that it was unnatural.
*  It makes sense that this bad thing that's hurting us couldn't be natural. But but the truth is,
*  some things that hurt us are natural. So there you go. Or, you know, I mean, I keep going back
*  to childbirth. I mean, I went to Peru, I got to tell you the story. So I went to Peru,
*  to research this book, because I wanted to talk with, like, as close as I could get to
*  pre agricultural hunter gatherers, right, and I can't get you can't get too close. But there
*  there are people called the Matsu genka, the Matu genka in the rainforest, that I got to talk to.
*  And I got to ask them about, you know, their relationship with technology and all that stuff.
*  I'm never going to forget, I go up to this, this guy, and I asked him, they've just had solar lights
*  installed, like in the main sort of area of their village. And I go up to this guy,
*  and I was like, how do you feel about having these artificial lights installed? And he and I'm
*  thinking to myself, you know, it's this pollution, right? Isn't it better to just have, you know,
*  the stars in the sky and the moon? And he looks at me, and he goes, he goes, this is good.
*  We can see at night now. He's just like, like, he was talking to just a fucking idiot. You know,
*  of course I'm happy. Right? Or this, and then there's this old lady. I was like,
*  they had, you know, they had a, they had a pump, like running water installed, basically,
*  clean water, right? So you could wash your dishes and your clothes. And I'm thinking, oh my God,
*  this is ripping them away from the natural way of life. And I asked this, I'm like, how do you feel
*  about the water? And she's like, it's, we don't, we don't get bacterial, I mean, she didn't say
*  bacterial infection. She was like, we don't get sick anymore from the water that we're drinking
*  from the river. I was like, oh, and she's just looking at me like, who, like, why, why is he
*  asking me this? Right? And meanwhile, I'm coming from this place where everyone wants to get closer
*  to nature, right? Because we have been alienated from it. And I'm asking from the perspective of
*  someone who thinks it just must be paradise living so close to nature. And she's like, no, we want
*  the, we want to be able to wash our clothes and have the fucking lights on at night. Yeah.
*  You know, and I was like, right, there was a shaman, I'm talking to the shaman in the village,
*  Don Alberto, right? And he's talking, he's like, you know, it's true that technology is messing up
*  the world. We've got climate change, we've got, you know, all these species are going extinct.
*  And he goes on and on, right? He's very close to nature. Very, very wise man. He's got a cell phone
*  also, right? And I'm like, well, so is technology bad? And he's like, he's like, yes, well, yes,
*  yes and no. He's on Tinder. Yeah, right. Yeah, that's what he's really doing. He didn't tell me.
*  But that's, and that's, I want people, I just want people to understand that there just aren't any
*  easy categories you can use to divide up the world into good and bad. And now that people,
*  now that organized religion is sort of the sphere of authority is shrinking, right? You don't go to
*  your priest to find out what to eat. You don't go to your priest to find out how to cure your disease.
*  Now that that authority is shrinking, I think people are looking to other similar kinds of
*  authority. And so they're like, okay, I can't go to my priest, but if I'm walking through the store,
*  what sort of criteria can I use to divide the world up easily into good and evil, clean and
*  unclean organic, organic and inorganic, right? Yeah. Artificial and it's built into our language,
*  Joe, like artificial, artificial might be a thing someday. Artificial, right? Is linked to artifice,
*  which is deception, right? So you've got manipulated, which really just means
*  humans got ahold of it and changed it with their hands also means something bad. So really built
*  into our language, we have this idea that natural means good, artificial manipulated, that's bad.
*  I think maybe it's because we have this insane power to manipulate things. And we, we all
*  collectively use the power to manipulate things that was created by scientists that have a far
*  greater understanding of what the implications and like what the process of this manipulation is.
*  And we just come along and use their technology. And that's, I think that's, that's a problem with
*  so much of what people do. Like we've, we've earned this power just by virtue of being alive
*  and being able to trade in goods and services for whatever that they've created. And then we don't
*  think about the consequences of utilizing this stuff. Like what is, there's gotta be, there's
*  some sort of a balance, right? There's a balance between, like if you want to have a fireplace in
*  your house, that's wonderful. Fireplaces are great. It's a nice smell, right? You walk in the house,
*  you smell a fireplace. If you're walking down the street and someone's got their fireplace on,
*  it smells good. But if the whole fucking place is on fire, it's terrible. You're filled with smoke,
*  you can't breathe. It's like there's a balance. And clearly when you see polluted cities,
*  clearly when you see polluted rivers and we're destroying the environment, there's a lack of
*  balance. We've utilized this power that we have to manipulate our environment, but we've done it
*  completely irresponsibly or we've done it without the awareness of the consequences of
*  eight million people doing the exact same thing. Yeah. Well, I mean, the scale you can do stuff on
*  with technology is really, I mean, it's made us incredibly powerful, right? There's Stuart Brann,
*  the guy who started the Whole Earth Catalog, you know, said basically we've become like gods,
*  so we have to be able to wield this power responsibly. I think it's easy to see that
*  and say, well, then the evil is in the form of the power itself, right? Obviously then if we've
*  got a nuclear bomb or we've got, you know, if we're polluting the world, then the problem is with
*  the technology itself. So you locate the evil in that technology, whereas, you know, what you're
*  saying, I mean, take burning wood, which is a great example. You know, we've got a lot of people on
*  earth now. We have them because kids aren't fucking dying all the time, right? I mean, so there's
*  some, there are some things that I discovered while I was reading this. For example, have you
*  seen that cartoon where there's two cavemen in a room? It's a New Yorker cartoon and they're
*  talking to, they're not in a room, they're cavemen, they're in a cave, sorry. So they're in a cave and
*  they're talking to each other and one of them's like, you know, we eat organic, we exercise all
*  the time and like nobody's living past the age of 35. What's going on? Right? So there's this,
*  that's, and that's the people that are like nature's bullshit take, right? They're like,
*  but, but actually it turns out that that cartoon is bullshit. So people didn't just die at age 35.
*  That was average lifespan because tons of kids were dying between the age of zero and five.
*  Truth is, if you made it past five, then you had a pretty good shot at like 60 or 70. So,
*  so it wasn't so bad in the state of nature. At the same time, there's another vision of what's
*  happening to us now. Have you seen that evolution? There's like an evolution cartoon where it starts
*  with, I don't know, like Paleolithic man or a chimpanzee or something. And then it gets to like
*  a big strong hunter with a spear and then technology comes in and they hunch over at the end
*  and they get obese and they've got like a Coke in one hand. And there's this idea like, well,
*  technology is now, we were perfect when we were natural and then technology has made us worse.
*  And for me, it's what you were saying. It's a balance, right? There are ways in which technology,
*  like my dad, my dad is 91. I talked to anthropologists and like, despite what you might
*  think, there aren't a lot of 91 year old hunter gatherers. They're just not out there. So I'm like
*  really grateful that my dad is super healthy 91 year old. That's crazy. That's an incredible
*  thing we've done. I'm glad that kids aren't dying all the time. I'm glad that mothers aren't dying
*  in childbirth. Those are incredible things like New York City, right? At the same time, we're
*  destroying the world. Right. So we got to work out these problems without using simple binaries
*  to figure out what's good and what's bad. It's better to have solar power than billions of humans
*  burning wood. Right. But solar power is obviously to me at least less natural than light in a piece
*  of wood. Solar power doesn't bother me at all. Yeah. I mean, I love solar power, but I'm totally
*  on board with what you're saying. And there is some sort of a balance and, you know, the nihilists,
*  like I have friends that will say, you know, we shouldn't have children and there's too many
*  people in the world and overpopulation is our biggest problem. I'm like, yeah, but I love people.
*  Don't you love people? Like a world without people would suck for people. Like if you, do you remember
*  that cartoon? There was a, excuse me, not a cartoon. It was an episode of Twilight Zone
*  where Burgess Meredith, he is the last man on earth and he accidentally breaks his glasses
*  and he can't read. He's always just wanted alone time to read his books and he's always been
*  bothered by all these people. And then he's inside, I forget what he's in a bank vault or
*  something like that. And there's a nuclear catastrophe, something along those lines. And
*  he leaves this area to go outside and he realizes that he's literally the last person on earth,
*  but he has all these books to read and he's so excited and he starts picking up these books,
*  but then he breaks his glasses and he's fucked. And I mean, the ideal of being the last person on
*  earth is one of the, that's probably one of the most terrifying ideas for a person to be completely
*  isolated and alone forever with no one to talk to. We love each other. People love people. We like
*  being around each other. We like the love of other people. We want to talk. And it's like a
*  vitamin. I mean, really it's like how you get vitamin D from the sun. You get vitamin L from
*  people. You really need it. It's a legitimate need. And we don't want people to die. And one
*  of the things about evolution is the, you know, I say this in the book, the gears of evolution
*  are greased with death, right? That's what it is. It's people dying before they reach reproductive
*  age. We've decided we'd like to prevent that from happening, you know, as much as we can. We don't
*  want people dying all the time. We love each other. We're stepping in with our virtue and stopping
*  natural selection. That's exactly right. And you know, it's a weird argument, I think, to want
*  to claim nature as this kind of benevolent deity that if only we follow what it tells us, right?
*  Just act naturally, which is a bizarre phrase if you think about it, because you've got to act that
*  way. But it is bizarre, right? It's like, no, no, no, just act naturally. You're like, well, but
*  that's it's hard for me. I'm gonna have to sort of artificially do this. But you know, I that we don't
*  want to be natural. We're unnatural animals. That's that's what we are. Not my phrase. H.G. Wells calls
*  us unnatural animals. And I think that's okay. We want to embrace that paradox instead of trying
*  as much as we can to figure out the ways in which naturalness is good. H.G. Wells is a fascinating
*  character, right? Because he predicted so many things. As a science fiction author, you know,
*  who was living in a time of very little technology in terms of like what we experience today,
*  that guy had a fantastic vision of the future. He did. I mean, it's interesting. This is a totally
*  it's a totally separate thing, I guess, for me. But when it comes to when it comes to the ability
*  of science and scientists to predict the future, I think this is a place I mean, we see it with
*  macroeconomists, most obviously. But there's a way in which we've come to expect that science,
*  because it has done such incredible things with manipulating reality, with telling us truths about
*  where we are in the universe, that also ought to be able to predict complex systems like where
*  humans going to be in 30 years or what's going to happen with the coronavirus 10 years down the
*  line or whatever it happens to be. But the truth is, fiction writers, science fiction writers who
*  have thought very hard about constructing plausible worlds are just as good of authorities on
*  predicting what's going to be happening with human systems 70 years, 100 years down the line,
*  as scientists are. So there are clear limits to what science and a certain form of investigation
*  can tell us about. And I think it's important if we stop trying to force scientists to tell us
*  everything, right? Like, what's going to happen with the economy? What's going to happen 70 years
*  down the line? What's going to happen 100 years down the line? At that point, we need a different
*  set of tools to figure out what to do with ourselves and what's going to happen. Yeah,
*  I mean, there's, there's a lot of people that think that there's not enough babies being born
*  in the Western world, because people are more career oriented. And we're worried that someday,
*  we're going to have underpopulation problems like Japan has right now. It's terrible. In Japan,
*  it's a real, it's a real crisis. And we got to that crisis, you know, how do we, all of these
*  things are a result of us, like you said, right, stepping in with our virtue, which I don't mean in
*  a bad way, but stepping in with our virtue, trying to fix things like feed people, for example, like
*  we don't want kids to die, we want there to be enough calories to go around. And what ends up
*  happening is we have a lot of people. So then we have to figure out new ways to house them and feed
*  them and power the things that they do and entertain them. And you know, and so on and so
*  forth. So we get a lot of people and then people like, well, okay, let's have fewer humans, because
*  that's the problem. But then when you do that, now you've got a system that depends on having
*  more humans, right? You need a younger generation coming in. So these systems are incredibly
*  complicated. And I think, I think, again, the, the reason people are leaning on naturalness so hard
*  is because when you're faced with complicated, uncertain systems, scary, you know, it's really
*  scary. And you want some kind of criteria, whether it's a holy book or a prophet, whatever it is to
*  tell you, no, I got this. Yeah, I think that's one of the weirdest things about today, right,
*  is that we are faced with these unparalleled crises, where we really we don't have anything
*  to go off of, we don't have a similar situation that happened, you know, in 1985, where we are
*  today with the Coronavirus. And then with the subsequent lockdown of the economy, where everyone's
*  terrified. And then you have the George Floyd murder. And then you have the looting and the
*  riots and the chaos and the protests. And then you have the Coronavirus kicks in again. And our leaders
*  look impotent. And we can't look to what I mean, when you have a guy like Donald Trump in office,
*  already you have a situation like, Jesus, I hope the cabinet can keep this thing together.
*  I hope the Senate can hold this business madness. We got a reality show host, who's the fucking
*  president. But then all the mayors are fucking up all the governor, no one, it's not even that
*  they're fucking up is that no one is equipped to handle this. So you see unprecedented anger,
*  particularly online, where you know, you're dealing with people. And this is one of the things that
*  drew me to you is one of the tweets that you made about processed information, that online
*  information is essentially processed information when you're dealing with like social media,
*  versus like actual communication like you and I are having right now, which is what resonates
*  with people. I think it's one of the things that resonates with podcasts. It's one of the reasons
*  why I prefer to do them in person. It's the closest thing to a real conversation with a real person.
*  Whereas this viewing of text, white on black, you know, white letters, in my case, I use the night
*  mode on a black screen. It's so weird, like you have to interpret intent, you have to try to get
*  and then you're not getting any social cues from the person. You're not there's not a back and forth.
*  It's just you spit something out, they spit something back. And it's you're trying to
*  approximate what it's like to actually talk to a person. It's very processed. I thought that
*  what you the way you described it was really the perfect definition of what ails us, where so many
*  people today are communicating in this way. And it's very similar to people surviving off a
*  processed food and becoming sick. It's so if you think about if you think about how processed food
*  was created, basically, and I mean, modern ultra processed food, because these terms are all really
*  slippery, right? Just like the term natural. So this is on a spectrum, right? The history of cooking
*  is a history of processing food, right? You like to cook, I like to cook. That's processing food.
*  Dessert is a kind of food that's been made to be highly palatable, you know, so it's not about
*  processing being intrinsically evil. But with ultra processed foods, what you've got,
*  is you got a bunch of companies that are like, all right, what can we exploit about human appetites,
*  to make foods as compulsively eatable as possible, right? It's terrifying. You've got I think Coca
*  Cola, I think it was said something like, we have to conquer stomach share. This is a term they use.
*  Yeah. So like, there's a, yeah, so you think, right, you have 100 think of the stomach, right?
*  Okay, so we got 100% of the stomach, like, how can Coca Cola fill the maximum amount of stomach
*  share in the humans of the world? Wow, what a bizarre way of looking at people. It's terrifying,
*  right? And so then, and they did it, because they've got the smartest people, you know,
*  they've got great chemists and biologists working, you know, day and night to figure out how to
*  conquer stomach share. And they started with cocaine, which is even more weird. Did you know
*  it's still okay. I discovered that when I was like, wait, there's a plant in New Jersey that's
*  getting Yeah, and it's the number one supplier of medical cocaine. It's Coca Cola. We should
*  tell people just tell people the what the what we're talking about for people don't know.
*  Yeah, well, so so Coca Cola, back in the day was made with with with cocaine for the for the
*  cocaine kick, john Pemberton, the guy who the guy who came up with Coca Cola had cocaine in it. And
*  to this day, there is a plant that's been grandfathered in, I guess, legally, I don't
*  know how it works, that is still importing enormous amounts of cocaine, processing it
*  so that it's no longer has an effect on you in the way that cocaine would and putting it in Coca
*  Cola. Yeah, the flavor of Coca Cola is apparently a big part of the reason why like Pepsi.
*  Unfortunately, Pepsi, you don't taste as good as Coke. You just don't say there's no cocaine in it.
*  Well, it's the flavonoids. There's just there's some, I think that's the right word. There's some
*  flavor that the cocoa leaf has. I've never had chewed cocoa leaf. But people who I've talked to
*  that have had it said it's an amazing way to get energy. It's like a cup of coffee.
*  They gave it to us when we when you arrived when we arrived in. So like when I was in Bolivia,
*  I had chewed cocoa leaves. What is it like? It's not I mean, it's not I mean,
*  it's not like being on Coke. It's just like Coke before I have. And it's nothing like that. So
*  it's it's a it's because cocaine, right is a ultra processed form, right of what is in the coca leaves.
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's how it's been described to me. Unfortunately, I've never
*  maybe fortunately, I've never done coke. But I have had mate de coca, the the tea from that,
*  which is really interesting, because I couldn't shut the fuck up. When I was drinking and I was
*  like, this is terrible for me. I already can't shut the fuck up. You give me this stuff. This is
*  awful. We got it. I want to want to get back to so it cocaine. So that we got side cocaine,
*  Coca Cola. Yeah, ultra processed food stomach share. All right, we're back. We're back. We
*  should tell people that this cocoa, this Coca Cola, when they do take the cocoa leaf, and they
*  process it and use the flavor for Coca Cola, then they take the cocaine out of it. And then
*  it's the number one medical supplier of cocaine is are the people that do that. So literally
*  medical cocaine like lidocaine and all that shit comes from I didn't know I didn't know it was the
*  same plant. That's crazy. Crazy. Yeah, that's medical cocaine. So these people are trying to
*  conquer our stomachs. And they did it. Right. And one of the ways they did it also was make it cheap
*  and accessible. There's vending machines in every school. I mean, think for a second how crazy that
*  is that there are vending machines with just Coca Cola and candy bars and stuff in every single
*  school we have, you know, it's that but but it happened, right. And so now we live in a world
*  in which extremely cheap, highly palatable and very accessible food is everywhere. No wonder
*  we have a problem with our diets. And that's exactly what's happening with information right
*  now. So I as as I understand it, the way in which Twitter was designed, for example, they consulted
*  with people who wanted to figure out how to keep you compulsively coming back. So like slot machines,
*  right. They consulted with people who build slot machines to figure out, okay, what, what keeps
*  people pulling the lever, right. So they could just have it refresh. You just have your tweets at the
*  top. But instead, there's a little alert button, right. You pull down, there's a little noise like,
*  or whatever the noise is when you when you pull down on it, you know. And so they've made it
*  compulsive. They've made it highly palatable, right. You want to you want to keep coming back.
*  And the thing is, the difference between ultra processed information and ultra processed food is
*  that I think we're we're we're the companies now. And that really freaks me out. We're the consumers.
*  We're also the manufacturers. And we're also the distributors. We make the meme someone is going to
*  take some cut of this show and turn it into a sound bite that's highly palatable in the way
*  that information becomes highly palatable. It's going to be oversimplified, right. It's going to
*  have heroes and villains. It's going to have a this going to demonize someone. And it's going to
*  be something that gives you a sense of belonging. Those are the three things I think that make
*  information highly processed and highly palatable. We want a hit of information that's easy to
*  understand, that demonizes someone, and that gives us a sense of belonging. And that's just like
*  exploiting what humans want, right. You're saying, you know, we're creatures that want to love each
*  other. We want to belong, right. It's just the same way we want to taste salt, sugar and fat.
*  We want to feel these things and the information that we have around us now. It's the it's the same
*  thing as a Snickers bar, except the difference is we're Snickers. We're making it. And we're
*  behaving like junkies, like rabid junkies. If you look at, I don't know what percentage of
*  Twitter discourse ends and people being angry with each other, but it seems like it's half at least.
*  I mean, it's just there's so much rabid discourse. There's just people pissed at each other and
*  insulting each other. And it's so unlike anywhere else in the world. And unless you're in a fucking
*  war zone, like the way people talk to each other, people talked to each other in real life, the way
*  they talked in on Twitter, the emergency ward would be filled with people with broken faces and
*  shattered eye sockets. It'd be chaos. Well, it's like road. It's road. It's how you treat people.
*  It's how you treat the person in the other car that's cut you off because they're not they've
*  been dehumanized. They're isolated, right. It's like Twitter just allows you to and social media
*  in certain ways facilitates being angry in the way that you get angry at other car. You like honk.
*  You're like, fuck you, man. I hate you. It's like it like, you know, it also causes that the reason
*  why people do that in road rage, it's because your sensors are heightened because you're moving so
*  fast because you're you're aware that split second decision making is it's important to survival.
*  So when you're going 65 miles an hour and you're looking around everybody and this guy gets it for
*  you motherfucker, like you're already at seven or eight. And I think this is also part of the
*  problem today online because of the coronavirus and because of the lockdown and economic
*  instability. And we were at unprecedented joblessness right now. I mean, people are
*  really hopeless. There's a lot of people that we got one twelve hundred dollar check from the
*  government and then that's it. And then, you know, you hear that Kanye West got this giant loan and
*  Judd Apatow got this giant. Well, these really wealthy people are getting all this money. But
*  meanwhile, salon owners, small business owners didn't. A lot of people are just fucking furious
*  at everything because it's like driving a car. You're you're already heightened. So this
*  information that comes at you, maybe it wouldn't have pissed you off under normal circumstances.
*  But now you're fucking furious. Right. It's like stress eating or something. So we have this. I
*  hadn't really thought about that with with road rage, but it does make sense. Right. So when you're
*  when you're already at that when you're already at that level, then you're going to be even more
*  likely to need that kind of information, want to participate in that kind of dialogue.
*  It's not dialogue, but no, it's not. Yeah. Yeah. It's and there's ways we can we can stop it.
*  I really think we can stop it by focusing on problems with the system and problems with
*  ourselves. Right. It's both of us because we're the ones manufacturing it and we're the ones
*  consuming it. So we can do things about it. And it ranges from, you know, I mean, I don't like I
*  don't have I still don't have a smartphone. You don't know flip phone. Wow. Yeah. Purpose. Yeah.
*  I mean, in part, not because you tweet a lot. I do. So that's not good. Well, it is. I know
*  it's compulsive. I think the reason I don't have it is because if I had a smartphone, man, it'd be
*  all over. I'd be on it all the time. I mean, when I'm at home, because I, you know, because I work
*  from home sometimes, my wife has my wife has a smartphone. And so I'll always be like using her
*  phone. What are you doing? Like, if you don't have a phone, you can't just go use my phone. Right.
*  And then I'm installing things on my computer, like freedom, which is this app that blocks you
*  from I mean, it's literally like, you know, with food, right, people have those locks that only
*  open. So I have an app that like locks me out of these sites. I have a folder on my desktop,
*  or on my, I guess, yeah, my desktop of my phone, that says junkie. And that's all of my Instagram
*  and Twitter and all that stuff. I was gonna show it to you. But it's important. That's that kind
*  of thing. So we need, I think we all need to collectively take steps in that way. But also,
*  we need to realize, and this is really important, right? It's not just about natural, unnatural,
*  it's not just about technology. We've had this kind of junk food information around forever. And
*  this is where I think for me is a, as a scholar of religious studies, right? If you look at myths and
*  folktales and fairy tales, and if you look at the structure of religions, there are ways to tell
*  stories to get people heightened. There are ways to tell stories to make people feel belonging.
*  There are ways to tell stories to demonize people, right? These tropes have been around forever,
*  right? What do you do? You create a villain. You tell a story about redemption. You tell a story
*  about a fall. You tell a story in which the people who are hearing the story, just by hearing it,
*  become heroes, right? These are things that have been around for a long time in the same way that
*  if you go back 2,000 years, if you were super rich and had access to lots of delicious, salty,
*  sugary, fatty food, you could get fat. It was just a lot harder back then. And in the same way,
*  now we've facilitated the manufacture of this kind of, these junk narratives that in small doses,
*  I think, are fine. But if it's all we're consuming, it's a disaster. And we're going to end up,
*  I think, with some problems that are analogous to the health problems that we're seeing because of
*  what we eat, except they're going to be problems in our soul, right? We're going to get mental
*  diabetes. Yeah. I feel like it's a, I mean, I'm not like a sort of organized religion person myself,
*  but I would say it's not just mental, it's like our souls. There's something deeply
*  corrupting of our humanity. And I catch myself doing it. So that tweet that you were talking
*  about, I had written a piece a week before that about Trump visiting the church and holding up
*  the Bible. It was this really angry piece. And I was like, I'm going to write about how terrible
*  this is and put this out there, right? And do something. The way he set it up too, like tear
*  gassing all the protesters to clear the area. I was like, what a horrible thing, right? I'm going
*  to tell everybody how horrible this is. I'm going to get my anger out. And then I, and then when the
*  article came out, I just realized that I was just sending it into the fucking machine, right? And
*  it was going to get ground up and the people who already agreed with it were going to read it and
*  be like, yeah, it's terrible. And the people that disagreed with it are either never going to read
*  it or they're going to see it. And they're going to be like, see people keep attacking Trump. Like
*  they're all crazy. And it, it was sort of like a crisis. I was just like, I don't want to,
*  I don't want to be doing, I don't want to be putting anything into this machine.
*  If it's just going to get processed into junk information so that we can feed our habit.
*  And this is a habit that we really don't know how to navigate. We've only been dealing with this habit
*  for when did Twitter get invented? 2007. It was very recent. Yeah. That's not enough time for us
*  to figure out how to do it. Right. I mean, you remember like during the, I'm 52. So when I was
*  a kid watching television for kids all day was fairly new, right? It'd only been like a generation
*  or two that that was even possible to just watch TV all the time. And it was constantly thought of
*  as the corrupting thing. Like get out, get away from the TV. You're all you do is watch TV, get up,
*  get outside. And that was sort of the first indication that there's a potential for an
*  unhealthy relationship with technology and with distributed content. Right. But I think Twitter's
*  far more toxic than that because you're actually putting the content out yourself and then you're
*  waiting to see how people respond and you shift the way you interact with people based on how they
*  respond to your tweets. Right. It's the belonging. Yes. Or your Facebook posts or what have you.
*  It's interesting you say that like thinking again about food because I'm obsessed with like the
*  first book I wrote was about food and like how we came to fear certain foods like fat or salt or
*  sugar. And thinking about it in this way, right, you need a technology to be able to process
*  something to get it cheap enough so that it can be widely consumed. Right. So information that allows
*  you to belong, right. For a long time, only certain people, I mean for a while, right, it's only people
*  who could read and write. Right. So that's all you've got. Those are the only people who could
*  produce it. And then now, it's so cheap to produce information that makes you a part of a community.
*  It's free. Right. We do it all the time. And like you said, we haven't figured out how to navigate
*  it. And that's another confusion I think that people have with natural versus unnatural,
*  which is that we also just have problems with novelty as human beings. Right. Something new
*  comes up. We still don't know how to navigate our food system. We still don't know how to stop
*  people from eating too much. We don't know how to do it. Collectively, as a society, we clearly have
*  not solved this problem. And yet, it's important to remember that for most of the world, the problem
*  is still not having enough. Right. So there was a time when the problem was people had no information.
*  You just didn't know anything. You knew nothing. That sucked too. Right. So it's great that we have
*  the internet. That was far worse. Yeah. That was far worse. Or at least not, I mean, like it was
*  really bad and it was bad in a profoundly different way. I mean, this goes back to like the
*  with the hunter gatherer thing, right. Whether it was better in a state of nature. I often hear
*  people, there's a great book called Against the Grain written by a guy who is at Yale and he
*  thinks that we need to be easier on the past and harder on the present in this book. And one of the
*  things he points out is like, oh, people these days, like humans, modern humans, you and I, we go out
*  and we don't know what a plant is or we don't know what an animal is. And he's right. Right. We don't,
*  most people don't have a have the knowledge of the natural world that hunter gatherers do. But at the
*  same time, they don't know about the germ theory of disease. They don't know about, you know,
*  planetary cycles. And so it's always important for me, at least as soon as I start to get sucked
*  into one of these binaries, right. It was so bad. It's so bad now today to remember that it was also
*  bad in different ways in the past. And we can't make the mistake of thinking that the problem
*  with information and our consuming of it today, we can't make the mistake of thinking that the
*  evil is in the form. We can make it good. We can make it better. We can learn how to deal with this,
*  I think. I hope as long as we're conscious of the problem. I think we can the same way we learn how
*  to deal with liquor stores. I mean, liquor stores are everywhere, but I'm not drunk. You're not drunk.
*  We don't go there and drink all day. And I think it's the same thing as dealing with this kind of
*  compulsion to use social media. You don't have to do it all the time. It's there, but you've got to
*  learn restraint and you've got to really be cognizant of the impact that it has on you.
*  Absolutely. It should be. Well, so what I mean, you know, bringing up alcohol, right? I mean,
*  one thing is, you know, taboos, cultural taboos are really important for controlling our relationship
*  to things that we would otherwise be compulsive about, like eating too much or having sex with
*  everybody. And so we institute these sort of taboos. I don't understand why it's not more of a taboo
*  to, you know, why it's not tabooed when you're on social media. If you're an asshole,
*  everyone should pile on to you for being an asshole on social media. I mean, I'm personally,
*  and I don't know, you may feel differently about this, but like, I'm just grossed out by people
*  sharing videos of random people and mocking these people. Like, I think it's just kind of creepy.
*  I'm not saying sharing videos of police or people in positions of authority. I just mean-
*  I know what you're saying.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.
*  Well, it's terrifying when you see, like, here's an example. And I don't think this person was
*  correct, but it was weird watching this. There was a girl who was on TikTok and she was talking
*  about Black Lives Matter. And she said, basically, if you say to me, all lives matter, she goes,
*  I'm going to stab you. And while you're bleeding out, you see this? While you're bleeding out,
*  I'm going to show you my paper cut. And I'm going to go, look, you know, I'm cut too. You know,
*  she goes, that's the difference between all lives matter. You know, like she was just screaming and
*  yelling, I'm going to fucking stab you. But it's just a bad analogy from a person who's trying
*  very hard to virtue signal. Cut to next video, she was crying that people had found the video
*  and they were attacking her. And then she got fired. And she got fired from this job that she
*  really loved. And there was in the comments of this, there was all these laughing emojis with
*  the laughing, with the tears coming out, where people were taking pleasure out of the fact this
*  person made this misstep. She's a young, she looked like she was in her twenties. She made this,
*  you know, she thought she was like putting something out in the world to stand up for people
*  that are being maligned and mistreated and, you know, and wrong by society and that there's a,
*  there should be a balance and understand the balance. And she made a terrible analogy,
*  just it wasn't good. But the fact that people were taking pleasure in the fact that this person got
*  fired from it was very disturbing. Why do we, I mean, I'm just sitting here thinking like,
*  why have I seen this? Why have you seen this? Like you knew, you're basically, it's like,
*  why did we consume that? I didn't know what it was. Why does that get part of my soul share,
*  right? If their stomach share, like why is that video even a part of my brain? It should not be
*  in there. There's no reason for it. It could be, there's a million better things that could
*  occupy that slot. But there's a fascination, the same way there's a fascination of people
*  jumping off buildings to a pool and missing and hitting the concrete. You know, I mean,
*  I've seen a lot of those. There's something, there's something about missteps because you know,
*  it could be you. Look, I'm a moron. If I was on a roof with one of my good friends and I had a
*  couple of beers in me and they're like, you want to make the jump? I'm like, fuck, should we? Like,
*  especially if I was 18, I probably would have jumped, you know, like there's a lot of people
*  that do, if I was her and I was 18, I probably would have made this a similar dumb video.
*  The thing is, okay, so with the, with the, with the swimming pool, right? This is, it's one thing,
*  I actually think it's one thing to mock someone for just doing some stupid shit. It's another
*  thing when the, when the background, and this again gets back to this idea of ultra processed
*  information, when the background, when what makes it so exciting is not that they're stupid or they
*  did something or I could have been you, but that they're evil, right? Ah, I get to watch evil and
*  I'm just good. I'm good just because I'm feeling that this person's evil. And that part, it's very
*  different from, I mean, it's very different from what was it like America's funniest home videos,
*  right? Like that's not, that was not a show where you were like tuning in to find out who the evil
*  people were, right? And then being like, look at those people. If we just like, they deserve what
*  they got, that would be crazy. It's so, I mean, just thinking about our attitude. I don't know.
*  It's really intense. Yeah, it's, I mean, it's not good. And meanwhile, I watch a lot of them.
*  I watched one today where a bus driver body slammed this guy. Apparently there was some
*  jerk who was bothering these bus drivers and he was picking a fight with his other bus driver.
*  And this second bus driver who he had apparently fucked with before comes up from behind and picks
*  him up and body slams him on the concrete, knocks him unconscious. It's horrible, but I watched it
*  three times. It's compulsive, right? It's the same way you can't step away from, I mean, not you,
*  but like, you know, in general, like the same thing with the, with the food, you know, you can't,
*  you can't help it. And yeah, it's, it's really as bad for your brain. And it's, but that one at least
*  is like, here's a person who's physically fucking with people and assaulting people and they got
*  theirs. But the girl with the paper cut analogy, it's like, she's just dumb, you know, she's just
*  a dumb kid who did a dumb thing and she thought she was being cool or she was fitting in and she
*  thought a bunch of people would be like, yeah, you go girl. And instead it came back and really
*  fucked her. Right. Although, you know, it's funny. So I've seen, you know, there's a, and you know
*  about this, like you've had some people like this on your show, like there's a, there's the tendency
*  again to divide the world up in the same way as natural and unnatural, right? Now another dichotomy
*  that's emerged is like woke people and then anti woke people. Right. And so the anti woke people,
*  and I'm, I'm generalizing here, but they look at the woke people and they're like, look at these
*  woke people, the woke people divide the world up into good and evil, right? The woke people are
*  like, Oh, look at all those unwoke sinners. We're woke, we're good. The unwoke are evil, but the
*  anti woke people are doing the same thing. They're like, look at those woke people tearing everybody
*  down. Those are the bad people. And if we just get rid of all the woke people, then everything will
*  go back to the paradise of free thinking and rationality where we could all speak our minds.
*  And I'm looking at these people and I'm like, do you not understand the paradox, especially because
*  these people are often like fairly smart, like philosophically minded people. And they're like,
*  I hate people that create demons and try to cast them out of society. We need to get rid of those
*  people and cast them out of society. And once we have that, we'll go back to paradise. And I'm like,
*  no, there is no paradise. It's complicated, right? Like even with the social media,
*  it's terrific that laypeople who didn't have power once can hold powerful people accountable. It is
*  a good thing that we get videos of cops doing bad stuff that before would have been hidden.
*  Right? So again, it's, it's more complicated. Like I like that. I'm happy about that. And I'm happy
*  about the way in which our technology has empowered people to find communities, right? Also just like
*  loners, like people that had weird hobbies, people that felt alone in their small town.
*  Now you can get out news. I mean, especially if you're dealing in a place where, you know,
*  the reporters can't get to people on the ground can get information out to people.
*  Exactly. There's a lot of positive benefits to social media. Don't get me wrong. I really,
*  if used correctly, I think it's very valuable, but I just think the power of it is very intoxicating
*  to people and much like processed food, which is where I think you, you had that great analogy.
*  I think it's just very, it's very dangerous to become completely like if you're eating
*  processed Twinkies nine hours a day, you're going to be sick. Well, if you're on Twitter,
*  nine hours a day, arguing with people, you're going to be sick. You really are. I know people
*  that have had real problems where, you know, they get tremendous anxiety, they're sweating
*  and they're involved in these back and forth with people all day and they can't sleep.
*  Yeah, there's that, there's a classic cartoon, right? Where it says,
*  like, honey, I can't come to bed. Someone's wrong on the internet. Right? It's perfect. I've had
*  that. Right? I'm like, my wife's like, what are you doing? I'm like, hold on one second. Like,
*  if I just tweet one more time, this person's going to have a conversion experience.
*  I think what you went with, with wokeness. And this is something that James Lindsay had pointed
*  out. And Douglas Murray has a great book about it in a lot of the areas that we're talking about.
*  What's going on is a religion. I mean, it really is. It's got all of the elements of a religion.
*  You can get cast out. You can get attacked for noncompliance. It demands this very rigid ideology
*  that you can't stray from. And it keeps getting more and more rigid as time goes on. Things that
*  were acceptable just a few years ago can now get you, you can get canceled, you can get fired.
*  You can lose your job. I mean, we're getting to this, like, you can lose your job and be attacked
*  for saying all lives matter, which seems insane. Just in terms of, I mean, it's understandable
*  where people are going from that this is like, no, you're in denial of this movement. But just
*  the term all lives matter should be universally acceptable, but it's not anymore.
*  Well, wasn't there also a cop though that got, I think there was a cop who got fired for sharing
*  black lives matter. This was very recently. And that's not to say that-
*  A cop?
*  Yeah. This was in New York. I mean, I know, don't quote me on this. Well, quote me on it. I just
*  got quoted on it. But-
*  It's too late.
*  Yeah, it's too late. No, I'm pretty sure it happened. But again, that's,
*  this is another problem with social media, right? Is like once it's said, it's out there,
*  and the amount of energy someone has said, the amount of energy it takes to like,
*  you know, reel back in misinformation is just disproportionate to the amount it takes to get
*  the misinformation out there to begin with.
*  A lack of understanding of like what a person does when they're thinking and expressing
*  themselves. Like think about what we're doing. You and I talked for three minutes before we sat
*  down and did this. I gave you a little tour of the place. We shot the shit about Laird
*  Hamilton superfood coffee and we sat down and started talking. You know what I mean? I mean,
*  we don't know each other, right? But so we're talking, we're just, there's no preparation
*  here. We're just saying things out of the blue.
*  This is, I want to push back on these anti-woke people though, a little bit,
*  because I think it's important, especially because they're very sharp. And so they make
*  very good arguments. And I think that part of their problem is they do something called
*  nut picking. Have you heard about this?
*  No.
*  So this is a phrase that I think a guy at Mother Jones, Kevin Drum, I think he coined it. It's like
*  cherry picking. And basically what you do is you trawl through any given group, university
*  professors, some blog, whatever it is, and you pick the nuttiest things you can. And then you say,
*  look what these, and this is actually what our whole information ecosystem does. It nut picks
*  for us. And so then what do you see? You see the craziest representations of any given group,
*  right? So you see, you know, if you're thinking about academia, right? You see some professor get
*  kicked out of a university, or you see some professor say some kind of crazy thing about,
*  like, you know, I don't know, like biological sex, not being real in animals or whatever,
*  you know, whatever the crazy thing is. And then that becomes how you see that entire institution.
*  You've not picked that institution, right? And it's easy to mock. It's fun. But like, the truth is,
*  if you sat these people down even, right? Like if you sat down the nuts from both sides, right? And
*  they had a conversation. They're complicated people, right? They have complicated thoughts.
*  They want to be able to explain themselves better. And I'm frustrated because what I really want
*  is for people to be able to have complicated conversations about touchy subjects. The most
*  touchy subjects. The problem with what you're describing, though, that these aren't conversations.
*  They are not. Someone spit something out. And even if it's preposterous, like animals don't
*  have biological sex, there's no one's talking to them. There's no one in the room with them,
*  especially not a biologist of equal standing, you know, someone who can go, actually, that's
*  ridiculous to say, and then you're having a conversation. Part of the problem is with just
*  statements. Or even if someone's writing a blog, there's a problem with no one being able to talk
*  while you're talking. That's absolutely true. I mean, for me, I just, I'm surprised by how much
*  I don't know. I mean, this is something I actually really appreciate about you. I don't know a lot
*  of stuff. So I'm out, when I was researching natural, I have a chapter on economics. I don't
*  know anything about economic theory. So I had to research that and talk to experts. I got a chapter
*  on sports. I don't know anything about sports. So I got to go talk to people who are experts on,
*  whether a cheetah blade for your leg, how do you figure out whether that's fair or not?
*  Or whatever. So I'm sitting down and I'm talking with these people. And what I realized is that
*  everything's very complicated, right? These are complicated issues. And when there's no one to
*  push back on you, and when there's no room for a dialogue, you just get the absolute stupidest,
*  most extreme versions of whatever position it is that someone holds. And the more touchy the subject,
*  the more that's true, right? Because the more people feel the need to say one kind of
*  sloganized version of whatever it is that they're talking about. And the truth is,
*  I think you could actually, if you got these people in a room, they weren't just angry at each other,
*  you could actually have really good conversations. Yeah, I think what you're saying too is really
*  important is that you're trying to, this idea of a sloganized version of it, you're trying to
*  reinforce your argument without any pushback from the other side, where a lot of these things are
*  nuanced and complex, and they're not black and white, and it's not a one or a zero. It's like,
*  there's a lot of pros and cons, and a lot of these things. One that I, you know, it's an
*  uncomfortable one to get into is abortion. It's a very, what I call a human problem, not just that
*  it's humans having abortions, and you're aborting a human, but it's a human problem in that very few
*  people are going to have a problem with it if it's like three cells. But then when it's three months
*  old, people are going to have more of a problem. When it's six months old, most people are going
*  to have a problem with it. So it becomes this very weird, like to say no abortion should ever happen.
*  Well, what about the morning after pill? You don't think that someone should be able to,
*  if they get drunk and they make a mistake and they accidentally get pregnant from sex,
*  you don't think they should be able to take a pill and end the pregnancy the day of,
*  the day of conception. Some people will say, no, you have to carry it forever and raise that kid
*  till it's 20. But other people will say, you should be able to have an abortion up until the day the
*  baby's out of your body. And I think that's fucking crazy too. It's one of those things where it's,
*  it's a complicated, very nuanced subject. No, no, it's just pro-life or pro-choice.
*  That's it, right? It's so stupid. What an unproductive way to think about it. And again,
*  I mean, you bring up abortion, right? But this is like what I said before, it's the touchy,
*  complicated, sex in general, right? Because God or the gods always care about sex, right? So it's
*  sex in general has always been talked about in this way. People want to draw neat, bright lines,
*  whether it has to do with age of consent, whether it has to do with who you should be having sex
*  with and why, right? Again, this is something that naturalness came into again, right? Because
*  people are like, okay, well, we got to figure out what kind of sex you should be having with who.
*  Well, how do we do it? If it's not God, right? And that's who it was for a long time telling
*  people who to have sex with and how, we'll look to nature. We'll figure out, and you know, you've
*  got people writing books about how, well, actually the natural way to have, you know,
*  to be sexual is polygamy. So clearly that's good and we should have, you know, monogamous
*  relationships are going to be terrible, right? And then there's other people like, well, no,
*  obviously, if you look at every culture, monogamous marriages have emerged naturally. So that's the
*  natural thing. And then somebody like, well, heterosexuality is natural. So you should never
*  have sex with people of the same sex. And then other people like, well, actually, we found these
*  animals here that are gay. So being homosexual is actually okay. It's been proven by nature.
*  I'm just looking at this like, it's obviously very complicated, right? Who you should have sex with
*  and how. Incidentally, there was a, while researching contraception and naturalness,
*  I ran into a book called Holy Sex, which is a Catholic's guide to, and I'm paraphrasing the
*  title here, mind blowing, toe curling, like, divinely sanctioned sex, right? And I'm reading
*  through it and there was a section on whether or not, so Catholic theories, really intense
*  Catholic philosophers will deny this, but they'll say natural means something else and they'll kind
*  of like do all this complicated reasoning, but it's not really true. They're drawing on what's
*  natural and what isn't in the sense of what's in nature. And the idea is that sex has to be natural.
*  So for a long time, it was that sex has to be tailored to procreation, right? So you can't have
*  anal sex, you can't have oral sex, you can't do coitus interruptus, which is pulling out, right?
*  All of those are bad because what God wants, what he's designed naturally, is for a penis to go into
*  a vagina and ejaculate into it to make a baby. So that was it. That was the criteria. But then we
*  had too many people in the world and Catholics were getting upset. They were like, well, I don't
*  want to have any more kids. I don't want seven kids. I don't have a farm. Like there's all these
*  reasons that people didn't want to have kids. So they came up with the rhythm method. You got the
*  rhythm method, right? And the rhythm method, this guy, Latz, the author of the rhythm method,
*  he spends most of the ethics section of that book, which was an enormous bestseller because
*  God didn't tell people about the rhythm method until like the 20th century. He could have told
*  them earlier, but he didn't. So Latz spends this whole book talking about how natural it is.
*  And he's like, look, this is natural. These are natural cycles. And there's a great quote,
*  some guys like in the Catholic church, you can use mathematics to prevent contraception,
*  but not physics or chemistry, right? It doesn't make any sense. Like how is this, how is it natural
*  to sort of plan your sex around rhythms? And this all goes back to the book, the holy sex book,
*  which is that, so then if the rhythm method is natural, right, then it can't be that sex has
*  to be directed to procreation, right? Because you've got a bunch of people who are having sex
*  at exactly the times where it won't result in procreation. So they change their understanding
*  of what natural sex is to just depositing. It ends with depositing semen in a vagina.
*  And in this book, there's a whole section on like, well, what about like, you know, anal sex and
*  basically he's like, if you follow the one rule and it ends in the right way, then you can do
*  everything else. And I'm reading this book. One rule, what rule is that deposit the semen in the
*  vagina. So you can do all that stuff as long as when you ejaculate it's inside a vagina.
*  That's exactly right. And I'm reading this. I'm like, how can you say this is natural? And
*  through his whole book, he's saying it too. He's like, you know, if you don't ejaculate,
*  if you don't end by ejaculating the vagina, all kinds of bad things happen to you biologically,
*  right? Your serotonin levels go down or whatever, all the same kinds of rationalizations that
*  people give whenever they're trying to show that something was designed by nature to be a certain
*  way. It was, and to me again, it's like, no, with abortion or with contraception or whatever,
*  we should be asking ourselves what works, what is it that we want and what is it that works?
*  And that's a complicated question. It's going to be different depending on your culture, depending
*  on the needs that you have at any given time in history, right? It's also, there's an inherent
*  problem with religion is that a lot of what they're doing is just controlling. They're
*  controlling people and what people want is freedom. They want the freedom to be able to do whatever
*  they want. If two people get together and they just want to use dildos on each other, why,
*  why would anybody have a problem with that? Do you want to do it? Does she want to do it?
*  Everybody's happy. Have a good time. Why does God care if God invented dildos?
*  Right. Well, that's, that goes back to the natural thing. Right. So that's exactly right. So now God,
*  they'll be like, no, God didn't invent dildos. People invented dildos.
*  God invented the idea of dildos. Every idea that you have comes from God.
*  Don't ask me to defend stuff. I think it's crazy.
*  God invented people. People invented strap-ons. God invented strap-ons.
*  So, but here's the thing, right? Again, and this goes back to my changing my mind is that
*  there is some way in which you can use what's natural as a kind of criteria. There's actually
*  this idea called the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, the EEA. And what this says is
*  basically, you know, there's a vague time that, that sort of determines how humans evolved, right?
*  So there are certain things that humans have evolved for and they evolve for those things
*  in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. And so then when we depart from that environment,
*  when we put vending machines in places or when we give people books to read,
*  one hypothesis you can have is that maybe that will have negative consequences for us because
*  we're not adapted for it. Right? So that, that's a fine hypothesis generating heuristic, right? But
*  what people do instead is they decide beforehand that it's necessarily bad. If it wasn't in the
*  environment of evolutionary adaptedness, if God, you know, if it wasn't there in the Garden of Eden,
*  then it must be bad. Right. And that's, and that's so, so it's not, it's not necessarily bad to say,
*  well, hey, is this, is this thing, is it natural? Like, is it, is it something that we are evolved
*  to deal with? But that doesn't necessarily mean that, you know, if it's not natural, that it's bad.
*  It just means maybe that we need a way to deal with it. I mean, a good example is reading,
*  reading things. I don't know. You don't have glasses on. I don't know if you have contact lenses,
*  but no, but I need glasses to read. Yeah. So like reading is not natural. That's just not a natural
*  thing. And there's, there's a bad result, right? Which is that we have worse vision because we're
*  squinting at things, but we fixed it. We came up with glasses and we're good now. So that's it.
*  So that's great. Now we get reading, which is awesome, you know, and like looking at small
*  things all the time and we fixed it with glasses. So that's terrific. Now, if the result had been
*  that like our eyeballs melted and we couldn't figure out how to solve that problem, reading
*  would be bad. Reading would be bad. Right. Knowledge would be bad. Be the devil's work
*  because it kills your eyeballs. Cause God doesn't want you to know anything more than what he put
*  in your head. And that's exactly what people would say though. They'd be like, if reading
*  melted your eyeballs, people would be like, well, of course it does. It's unnatural. Well,
*  that wasn't the argument that they use during the time of Martin Luther to keep people from reading
*  his phonetic interpretation of the Bible. The anti-reading thing goes back to Socrates,
*  which actually sounds a little bit like some of the stuff you were saying about dialogue,
*  where he says, if you have, and I'm paraphrasing, not my area of expertise. If you have the written
*  word, this is going to be a disaster because one of the things that happens with the written word
*  is it can't respond to the interlocutor. This is what he says. So when you write things down,
*  instead of saying them, people are going to take that and interpret it for themselves. It's going
*  to be terrible. You know, of course this is paradox because you're reading it. It's good and it can be
*  bad. I mean, that's really what it is, but it is also incredibly valuable just for storing information,
*  just for distributing information. It's unprecedented. It's changed the world,
*  but it also can be bad because it can have a distorted version of the reality of what you're
*  writing about. Right. That's exactly it. And that's, you know, I think that, I think the
*  reflexiveness of wanting, so I'm sort of, I think I'm slowly turning into an evangelical agnostic.
*  I think this is what I am because like the baseline, the baseline should be uncertainty.
*  I think, I think the world is an uncertain and mysterious place. And that's a wonderful thing.
*  Right. Wonder is a word that actually has built into it both loving the world, right? Like this
*  is wonderful, but it also means you don't know. I wonder, right? There's a way in which wonder is
*  tied to doubt and uncertainty. And that, I wish that were our default position, global uncertainty.
*  I don't know what's going on. This is a mysterious place. I want to figure it out.
*  And then local certainties, right? You have a decision you need to make at a given time.
*  And you're like, you know what, given what I know, looks like the right thing to do here,
*  or the right thing to believe here is this. But that certainty shouldn't be the default. It should
*  be local certainty, global uncertainty. Well, there's things you're certain of,
*  and there's things that you aren't certain of. And it's very important to be clear on the
*  difference between those and not attach yourself to whether or not you're correct or incorrect.
*  Because human beings with language and with dialogue, we were playing a game. Like if you
*  and I were in dispute about something, and even if you were correct, if my ego got involved,
*  I would want to be correct. So I would try to manipulate my version of reality in order to
*  trounce you. And people do that. Absolutely. It's a horrible thing to do. And it's a message
*  that I try to get out as much as possible. You are not your ideas, and you cannot be married to them.
*  You have to if you're wrong, if something's you like, Oh, I thought it was this. I am very quick
*  to say that. And it's something that I've developed. It's something that I have worked very hard to
*  cultivate, to not be attached to any idea that I have or that I espouse. And that if I'm incorrect
*  to say very, very quickly, as soon as I find out, I'm incorrect about this. It's so messed up that
*  with politicians, for example, people accuse a politician of flip flopping, as if it's like,
*  No, you don't want to log actually, if there's someone who has the sort of wherewithal to change
*  their mind. Why would we shame them for saying, Whoa, well, it's obvious. You know, it's wrong.
*  Politics are a game. It's a game of victory. I mean, it's a it's not just a game. It's a game
*  with time periods, right? You have you have till November, you have X amount of weeks, you have
*  your primaries are coming up. These these it really is a game. So there's very little room for nuance.
*  You have a time period. I mean, buzzers up, you miss the three point, the game's over. And it doesn't
*  matter who's right or who's wrong. It's about winning. I just don't get the why people I mean,
*  I guess I do and I don't get it right. But why would you demand that of your politicians, right?
*  So if I'm looking at a politician, what I would want and not just a politician, right, a teacher,
*  a friend, I'm looking for someone who is able to who is able to change their mind, whose ego isn't
*  wrapped up with sticking to their guns, whatever happens, right? And isn't the problem with their
*  their opponents, though, because their opponents are the ones who are going to call them out on it.
*  Yeah, well, the general public was like, stop calling them out for changing his mind, you moron.
*  It was awesome that he changed his mind. Well, if you say it that way, it's going to create more
*  problems. You're right. See, I just did it. I just did it. It's normal. It's normal to lapse. Oh,
*  it's those people who are bad, right? If we just get rid of those people, Joe will solve a reality.
*  You're just enthusiastically expressing yourself, but you're doing so, you know, with an insult.
*  You know what? Okay, so one of the things I do, you know how you have like the junk, the junkie
*  folder. Yes. So to remind myself of how blind I might be and how I could like how I need to change
*  my mind. Right. I talk about this with my students, but I keep it with myself. I actually have a
*  can have a touchy. I have a Confederate monument in my wallet right here. So I keep I don't know if
*  you know. So the Confederate two dollar bill. Oh, wow. That's a real Confederate. That's a Confederate
*  two dollar bill. And that guy on it right there, that's Judah Benjamin. That he's that he's the
*  only Jew who ever made it onto American currency, if you want to call it. And it's Confederate
*  money. Confederate money. Yeah, go for it. What year is this from? I sometimes let's see. What
*  does it say on there? I don't remember the exact year on the bill. This is weird, man. It's paper.
*  Yes, paper. But it's like really flimsy paper. I would think you would want to like keep this
*  under glass or something. No, it's not. I mean, they're not like super valuable. It's not. No,
*  but historically, I mean, it's so touchy, right? Even saying anything about Confederacy, like,
*  of course, it's not valuable. You fucking idiot. But they they won't do that. I'll tell you why,
*  because here's why I keep that in my wallet. People won't do that. I mean, maybe they'll take
*  that sound bite and it'll get ultra processed and people will be like, he was arguing for
*  Confederate monuments. That's stupid, because I keep that in my wallet. Because that guy celebrated
*  Passover. That guy celebrated Passover, which is a Jewish holiday, all about how slavery was bad.
*  Meanwhile, it looks like he's got a little Hitler mustache. He had he had slaves.
*  Whoa. So here's this guy who's a Jew in America in the 1800s, who's one of his most important
*  holidays is a celebration of the Jews liberation from slavery, who had most likely slaves in his
*  house, serving him the Passover dishes and certainly washing them. And what that means to me,
*  at least, is like, there's going to be something in my life that I'm as blind to, as that guy was
*  to the evils of slavery. And if you can have your most important holiday, be a holiday where you're
*  celebrating the liberation of your people from slavery, and still end up on a fucking Confederate
*  bill, like, God knows what we're blind to right now. Right? Like, what is it that we're not seeing
*  right now? And people can justify is very strange. Right. And it means that it means that no matter
*  what, there's probably some kind of thing that that 100 years from now is going to seem like,
*  how could Alan, how could this idiot have not seen that? Right? It was right in front of his eyes.
*  Yeah. What do you think that thing would be? Have you ever tried to think about it?
*  Yeah, I have tried to think about it. What do you think it would be? Well, so there's a there's a
*  couple of things I think it could be. One of them is the fact that we've essentially exported slave
*  labor. So, you know, people are going to be like, all these people who were talking about how
*  slavery is bad, right, and chattel slavery is a very, very different thing from other kinds of
*  slavery. But there are ways in which people are trapped in horrific situations, who are manufacturing
*  the goods that I have now gets complicated rapist people like, well, you know, that's better that
*  than no job at all. I'm not sure exactly how it all plays out. But I can imagine a future in which
*  people look back at me and you, and the things we are consuming and saying how were they blind
*  to the conditions in which those items were produced? Sure. Well, one of the best examples
*  is someone tweeting about slavery on an iPhone that's made by someone who works at Foxcon,
*  who has these giant nets around the building to keep people from jumping off because they
*  live such horrific lives that they they leap to their death so often they have to protect the
*  building with nets. And this is the exact point at which if you wanted to ultra process this
*  conversation, you take that sound bite and you'd say, look at these two assholes comparing
*  working in a Foxcon factory to chattel slavery, which is precisely not explain chattel slavery,
*  chattel slavery. Well, so sometimes so for example, when people are trying to justify the Bible and
*  the fact that like, so why didn't Jesus, here's this guy who came down and he, you know, shocked
*  everyone, right? Why didn't he also say like, you know, also slaves need to be released ASAP.
*  Slavery is bad. He didn't say that. So one of the things people will point out is that there are
*  different forms of slavery. So chattel slavery specifically where people are turned into property
*  and bought and sold and have no opportunity to earn their freedom is a sort of, is a specific
*  kind of slavery that was the kind of slavery we had in the United States. It's uniquely, horrifically
*  bad. And so that kind of slavery is not the same thing as working in a Foxcon factory. But, you know,
*  when I think about, you know, I'm thinking about this right here, I'm on like, you know, what's
*  going to happen when that parallel gets made? You know, I think it's actually an instructive
*  parallel, right? Like I'd like us to think about what, you know, how we're the goods that we're
*  using and consuming and where they're made. I also don't want people to think that for a moment,
*  that chattel slavery is the same thing as working in a Foxcon factory.
*  Most certainly isn't. But it is.
*  But it's bad.
*  It's bad. Working in a Foxcon factory is bad. You don't want your children to be there.
*  Joel Salatin will tell you. Another thing is eating factory farmed animals.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, it's messed up. I don't know. Like I do it, you know, I go out, I eat meat that I know
*  comes from a place, you know, where the animals are not treated, where they're in hell. It's
*  animal hell, you know, and we have these animal hells. When do you do that?
*  I mean, just yesterday when I went out and ate like baby back ribs down the street,
*  I guarantee those baby back ribs didn't come from Joel Salatin's polyphase farm.
*  Right.
*  And I think that, you know, that's something I think about. But I do it anyway. I can imagine
*  a time when we look back on our current eating habits and we're like, why wasn't everyone
*  arguing for ethically sourced meat? Like how was it that people didn't want to, you know,
*  force everyone collectively to pay more for meat that was raised in a way like the kind of way
*  that Salatin pioneers, right? In this, I'm really on board with Salatin. I think he's right.
*  Look, there are contexts in which animals are happier and less happy. They're happier on my
*  farm and they're fucking miserable. But I thought it was very interesting in your book when you
*  talk about Michael Pollan pressing him on whether or not you could feed New York City that way.
*  And he's like, do you really need New York City? Yeah. Well, so Salatin's got it. Right. So this
*  is well, and Salatin thinks, I mean, he thinks about this, right? Like you saw in the book in
*  explicitly divine terms, right? God has designed the world. I'll tell you, this is a story I tell
*  at the end of the book. I was eating Salatin's delicious pork. I mean, it was incredible. It's
*  an incredible place, Polyphase Farms. And I was eating his pork and like the people there are
*  awesome. He's awesome. And he announces to everyone, he says, look, we're going to be doing
*  a bit of a change. We have a new thing that we're going to be doing. We are going to be
*  producing chickens for a growing segment of our market that doesn't want soy fed to their
*  chickens. So Salatin's chickens get a lot of their calories, not from his farm. They get a
*  significant portion of their calories from non-GMO soy that's grown at another place outside of
*  Polyphase. Right? So it's not a self-contained system. He says, but there's some people that
*  don't want soy fed to their chickens. They feel like they react to soy, they don't want it. So
*  they're going to start feeding their chickens. There's a certain percentage of Salatin's
*  chickens. These can start feeding fish meal, ground fish meal. So afterward I went up to him
*  and I was like, you know, Joel, that doesn't seem very natural. Like do chickens eat?
*  They swim.
*  Like how are they getting all this fish? And you know what? He looked at me and he said,
*  I'm a hypocrite. You know, I'm a hypocrite like anyone else, but at least I admit it. And what I
*  wanted to say to him was there's nothing wrong with feeding your chickens fish meal. If some people
*  want chickens that are fed fish meal and you're treating your chickens in a way you think is
*  ethical, there's not some kind of purity test that you need to apply to your farm, even though
*  it's on a road called pure Meadows Lane. Right? But it's like, you don't need a purity test for
*  your farm. You're, you're a good guy who cares. I mean, I really think he's a guy who really cares
*  about his animals, you know? And, and it just kind of made me sad that he thought of that as some sort
*  of hypocrisy. Well, the only hypocrisy that you could see in it is factory farmed fish is awful.
*  I mean, it's, it's really bad. I mean, it's bad for the environment. It's bad for the fish. It's,
*  there's, there's not a lot of sustainable factory farm fish operations. It wouldn't make you wince
*  if you actually saw how they process all that fish meal. So I'll tell you, I, factory farmed fish.
*  So another thing, I didn't know any of this stuff until I started this research. So I'll tell you
*  a story, crazy story. I was in the Netherlands researching the food chapter of this book, which
*  is about vanilla, which I could talk to you about vanilla, which sounds very boring, right? Which is
*  why I picked it. It's vanilla. I'm researching vanilla and people want natural vanilla. And I
*  don't know if you know, do you know where vanilla comes from? Vanilla beans? Yeah. You know where
*  those come from? No, that was, that was the end of my, that was the end of the line for me. Right?
*  So we've got vanilla beans in the house. So they, they're actually on an orchid. This beautiful
*  white orchid vine is where vanilla beans grow. That makes sense. Vanilla ice cream has that orchid on
*  the. Yeah. Yeah. All of a sudden I was like, oh wait, that's what my yogurt looks like that.
*  Every single one of those is artificially inseminated. So there's a person who goes
*  and you can watch YouTube videos of it's crazy. They always been like that.
*  No. So vanilla used to be only in Mesoamerica. That was the only place where it grew naturally.
*  Right. That's the only, so everyone thinks of Madagascar, right? Madagascar vanilla.
*  Only place vanilla was growing was in Mesoamerica. It was these Mayan silviculturists,
*  which is like forest gardeners who had, who, who grew this and it was pollinated by its only known
*  natural pollinator, which was this thing called a Melapana bee. I don't know if I pronounced that
*  right, but whatever. So that's the only place it was. And when people came from Europe, they were
*  like, this is incredible vanilla, amazing. And they wanted to grow it, but they couldn't because
*  they didn't know how to pollinate it. And then a 12 year old slave named Edmund Albeus discovered
*  how to artificially pollinate vanilla flowers. And just like that, you now have the ability to
*  grow vanilla orchids in un, in non natural habitats. Right. So it's still expensive because
*  you can only grow them in Madagascar, Tahiti. You probably, I don't know if you know this, but like,
*  you know, they're, they're, uh, it's vanilla beans are incredibly expensive. Natural vanilla is just
*  really expensive ingredient. Um, and that's because there's not a lot of places it can be grown. So
*  they're looking for ways to make natural vanilla cheaper. And the Netherlands is where all of the
*  best growing technology or a lot of the best growing technology is. So I went to a university
*  there where they have a greenhouse where they're growing vanilla orchids, pineapples, bell peppers,
*  like coconuts. I mean, you name it, everything they figured out how to grow all of these natural
*  plants. Right. But I'm sitting in here and I'm like, you've got vanilla orchids growing out of
*  these buckets in this highly technological environment. You know, it's all temperature
*  controlled. Right. And for what? So that you can have cheap vanilla beans that can be labeled
*  legally natural. And that whole story comes back to the salmon and the fish that you were talking
*  about before, because in that same place, there was a machine like at a Charlie and the chocolate
*  factory with like pink sludge whooshing through it. This was, you know, a couple of, a couple of
*  places down from the, from the vanilla orchid house. I was like, what's that? The guy who's
*  showing me around says that's algae that we're growing here because people want their salmon,
*  their farmed salmon to be pink. And it's not pink because it doesn't eat the diet that it gets in
*  nature. So it's naturally gray, but people, people won't pay for that. So he's farming algae,
*  which is natural. So he's, that's the stuff, the pink stuff. And then they feed that to the farm
*  salmon just so it can be naturally pink. So when you go into your whole foods or whatever,
*  and you see that your salmon is all natural and it's pink, and I'm just looking, I'm looking at
*  this whole thing and I'm like, what is wrong with us human beings that we've gotten to this point
*  where we like, we want stuff natural so bad that we're developing new technologies to figure out
*  how to like have our cake needed too. It's really an orange, but they dye it. They do. They got the
*  orange, just orange pinkish color, but there's also a way. So as taxa thin, I think is the chemical
*  that, and then you can have it artificially, but then people don't want artificial. Can't they just
*  feed them the bugs that they eat that make them way too expensive? Really? Yeah. For when you want
*  it on that scale. So they feed them this algae and, and I was like, I get, I get, I get what we're
*  doing. I get what we want, right? We want stuff that's better for the planet. We want natural.
*  And so then, yeah, so what do we do? So what, but it's so complicated, right? Like what you're
*  saying, like what do we do with factory farm fish? You're like what you were saying about Joel
*  Salatin. How do you get, how do you get Joel Salatin's meat to people that can't afford it?
*  Right. How do you? If I knew the, well, some people would say lab grown meat, right? So that's,
*  but that's not the same as Joel Salatin's meat at least. Not for now. Not for now. I'm really
*  curious about lab grown meat. I'm not curious about the like impossible burger type stuff because
*  I just, it's not, it's neither, first of all, I don't like the idea of pretending something's
*  meat. If you don't want to eat meat, it just seems ridiculous. And I get it as sort of like,
*  you know, I mean, it's like a gateway drug, you know, like you're tricking people into becoming
*  vegetarian by giving them a burger and like, look, you can have a burger and still be vegetarian.
*  Look, we've got you, but that's not healthy. Like if you want to eat healthy vegetables,
*  you should eat vegetables. You should eat vegetable dishes that are actually made with
*  vegetables. So what's meat? What do you think counts as real meat? Like if you grow a steak in a vat?
*  Yeah, that's interesting. I think that, well, they are probably going to be able to do that with
*  alarming accuracy within the next 10 years where they're going to make a ribeye. Like it's going
*  to have marbling. It's going to taste like a ribeye. And I'm all a hundred percent down for that.
*  I'm a hundred percent down for that. Do we get to call that steak? Because the steak lobby,
*  there's going to be a meat lobby that's like, you know, it's like the almond milk. You can't
*  call it milk. There's going to be a bunch of people that are like, unless it came from a cow.
*  Yeah, well the almond milk lobby, I mean, they're right for milk. You mean it's not milk?
*  It's not milk. Like milk has to come from a breast. Like it's absolutely not milk.
*  Well, doesn't a steak have to come from a creature?
*  Well, it comes from a lab, but it essentially has the exact same properties as a steak.
*  That's the difference. Almond milk is in no way, shape or form milk. It's not milk. It's
*  weird water. You've just done some weird shit to water to make it white. You know, it's not milk.
*  But if you can recreate steak, if you can do, like if you can 3D print steak, it's still going to be
*  steak. Now, if you're the type of person that wants to eat the soul of the animal and you want
*  to be there when the animal gets killed and you want to take the slice the piece off and throw it
*  on the fire and you want to know, you want to be like boots to the ground and know, well, that's
*  a different thing. You're asking for a different thing. But if you're asking for meat that has the
*  same amount of essential fatty acids as a grass fed ribeye steak, you can do that, I think. I think
*  they're probably going to be able to do that. It's interesting though, like the way, so talking
*  about what counts as a steak, right? This idea, I mean, naturalness again comes in here because
*  the word nature, right? It actually means birth, natura, origins. So naturalness has to do with
*  the origins of a thing. And we think about origins a lot when we think about what a thing is, right?
*  We want to know where it came from. And that tells us what it is, right? And so with a steak,
*  there's going to be a lot of people who are going to say, you can't call it a steak unless its origin
*  is a cow. There's going to be other people who are going to say, no, if it looks just like and is
*  chemically composed identically to a steak that comes from an animal, then it's an animal. But
*  I'll give you an example to push back on what you were saying a little bit. Take a lab grown diamond.
*  I mean, I guess, well, actually, oh no, I think I might have put my foot in my mouth.
*  Some girls don't like that. I've had this conversation. They get upset.
*  It's because it's not the same thing. Well, it's cheaper. That's the only reason why.
*  No, it's magical. They know they want you to pay for something. They want a slave to dig that thing
*  out of the side of a fucking mountain. There's something weird about that. Like, don't you think
*  there's also a romance to the idea of a mineral that was made by pressures under the earth over
*  millions of years? You think it's just about price? I think there maybe is some romance to that. But
*  I think with women, there's something nonsensical that's been drilled. Not all women. Sorry, if
*  you're one of them. Don't fucking generalize. I'm not. I swear to God. But I think some women
*  have this idea that's been drilled in their head by marketing that you should spend three months
*  of your fucking salary on a rock. And it's complete nonsense. First of all, if you understand the
*  De Beers, like what they've done with the diamond market, and you probably do, you know, it's like
*  ridiculously overinflated. There's far more diamonds. They're far more efficient at getting
*  diamonds out of the ground than they ever were before. So they have this insane backlog of
*  diamonds. I mean, diamonds aren't rare, like, but they're stupid expensive, and they really shouldn't
*  be. But they've done an amazing job of keeping them stupid expensive. That said, if someone can
*  artificially create something that's absolutely indistinguishable from a diamond, there's a part
*  of some women that will think that because that was created by a machine, it's not as valuable,
*  it doesn't mean as much. And it's not worthy of the same sort of appreciation and, and, and,
*  you know, this, this weird thing that women have with you, I'm sure you've seen women look at each
*  other's rings and like check out the rings. It's, it's a symbol of so many different things. It's
*  like, how much does your man love you? How wealthy is he? How, how well did you do in choosing a mate?
*  There's so many things involved with this ridiculous ritual of diamond rings that for whatever reason,
*  those women that have fallen into this nonsense, they're not interested in some sort of a work
*  around, you know, some sort of a 3d printed diamond ring, even if it's perfect, they don't want it.
*  It's marketing.
*  I don't know. I don't know, man. For me, I mean, maybe if I was being given a,
*  if I was being given a diamond ring and the prices were identical, I think, and this is where I
*  changed my mind, right? This is about where the naturalness stuff comes in again, right? That stone,
*  that pyrite, even if making that gold cube were actually more expensive than getting it out of the
*  ground, there's something about where it came from that enchants it, right? That sort of makes
*  it magical. That's what, that's part of Yellowstone, right? Is that, you know, they talk about, okay,
*  the genetics of our, you know, our bison are, they don't come from outside of here, right? Even if
*  it's indistinguishable to people looking in at the animals, there's something about maintaining
*  genealogical purity or something like that, that something came from somewhere,
*  which I think drives, I mean, you're probably right. I don't know. It all goes back to economics,
*  right? Like the steak people, like maybe the steak farmers don't actually care about it, but I think
*  Joel Salton would be like, no, don't call that a steak. He would say, don't call that a steak.
*  And he'd say it's not a steak because it doesn't come from a cow. No, I'm sure he would, but let
*  me push back on the genealogical thing because Yellowstone in particular has some of the most
*  domesticated elk that you'll ever be around. It's so bizarre. I was there with my children
*  and we were taking selfies with the elk and they were like 30 or 40 feet away from us,
*  or it was probably more like 20 yards, but close enough that in nature that would fucking never
*  happen. They would run like hell if they saw people or they saw any animal that looked like
*  it was an eyes facing forward predator. And in Yellowstone, they're so accustomed to people and
*  they've actually adapted their behavior to congregate around the parks because they're
*  less likely to be killed by wolves there. So they'll go around these like visitor areas.
*  And there was a fucking vending machine and then 30 yards away from the vending machine is an elk.
*  And I have a photo of me standing in front of this Coca-Cola machine looking like this. And then
*  behind me is an elk. You used to feed the bears there? Oh yeah. Yeah, I was there when they fed
*  the bears. No. Yes. When I was a kid, me and my parents went through Yellowstone when I was like
*  seven or eight years old and there was cars in front of us that would put food out the windows
*  and the bears would put their paw on the car and take food from them. I think the elk example is
*  a good one for, I mean, I might be wrong, but for what I was arguing, which is that you seeing the
*  domesticated elk there, right? If Yellowstone for me, when I visited, right, it was like, look at
*  this. Look at these bears. Yeah, it's incredible. Hello. Hello. Yeah, so strange. Yeah, I witnessed
*  this firsthand when I was a kid. They would also congregate. Look at that. That's really crazy.
*  Look at this lady out of her fucking mind. She's going to climb out of the thing.
*  I'm sure a lot of people got killed that way too, by the way. This was, they were the heads of the
*  people that like headed up Yellowstone encouraged this stuff. Yeah, they didn't know any better.
*  Right. Well, that's a while before they figured that out. And also, you know, the bears, the problem
*  is they bears are uniquely, they have habits that they form in terms of where they get their food,
*  which is why it's really a problem if a bear gets into your garbage, because they'll never stop
*  going into your garbage. You have to, they have to kidnap the bear and move it to a zoo or take it to
*  another mountain really far, far away, or they have to kill it. Like there's no other way. So this is
*  the elk that you saw at that vending machine. And you tell me, I'm curious how you felt about it. To
*  me, seeing that kind of thing in Yellowstone is a little disappointing. And it's disappointing
*  because I think of Yellowstone as like, you know, and it's advertised this way, right? Come here to
*  see, and it's all the books and the tourist shops, but come here to see pure nature. Okay. First of all,
*  there's no way, there's no way you're going to have buildings and cars in pure nature. It's not real.
*  I, I'm a hunter. So I go into the woods. I get most of my meat from mountains. I bow hunt. So, and
*  one of the reasons why I do this, I started out in 2012, because I was either going to become a
*  vegetarian or I was going to become a hunter. I was watching too many of these PETA videos. And I
*  was like, this factory farming thing, it's insane. Once you know, once you see it, you can't see it.
*  This is something you, you are also. Yeah. I mean, I had just, I had tried to figure out a way to
*  I had to, I would morally, I was coming to this point in the road where I was like, I've got to
*  do something. I either have to figure out a way to acquire my own meat and be comfortable enough.
*  Like I've never killed an animal. I mean, I need to be able to kill this animal and eat it and be
*  comfortable with it or not. Like, I don't know if I am. And once I went hunting, I realized like,
*  this is probably the most insanely connected way. And it really hits some switches inside of your
*  body, inside of your DNA that I didn't even know were there. And these switches that like connect
*  you to it's almost like a psychedelic experience. It's very strange, like being in the wilderness,
*  stalking an animal and locking eyes with it and hunting it and then wind up eating it over a fire.
*  It's all these switches go on. It's very strange in a very positive way in a very reverential way.
*  Like you revere this animal, like you appreciate it in this really intense way. But these are wild,
*  wild animals. You're domesticating an animal if they're hanging out all along. Like I was
*  looking at the house once in Colorado with my family and we went out into the backyard and there
*  was a giant deer, like a huge buck that was just standing there staring at us. It was in Boulder,
*  Colorado. And I don't know if you've ever been to Boulder, Colorado, but it's like a lot of hippies.
*  And obviously no one's hunting in Boulder, Colorado. So these deer are completely relaxed.
*  They're just chilling. And so this deer is, I mean, no more than 100 feet away from us,
*  just staring at us, just looking at us and then just moves around a little and eat some grass and
*  looks at us again. And my wife is like, I didn't even think that was real. I thought it was a
*  statue until it started moving. I would never kill that deer, not in a million years. That's
*  like killing someone's dog. There's no way. I mean, I would have to be starving to kill that deer.
*  But if I was in the woods and I saw a deer that big, I would be very excited. I'd be like, wow,
*  that's like hundreds of pounds of meat. Look at the size of that deer. It's an amazing specimen.
*  And it's a big old mature deer, which means that it's passed its genes on for many, many years.
*  And a deer only has, if they're really lucky, they have nine, 10 years, and then they get killed by
*  wolves or mountain lions or whatever. That would be the perfect animal to hunt. But in this scenario,
*  there was none of those switches went off. I'm like, that's a domesticated animal. That might
*  as well be a Chihuahua. Right. Yeah. And it feels, and that's part of the criteria you're using
*  for whether it's okay to kill it. I mean, that's one of the things with the bison hunt in Yellowstone
*  that seems so weird, right? It's like these animals that have no idea what's waiting for them
*  cross this line. And then all of a sudden they're magically available to be shot.
*  That's a complicated issue. And one of the reasons why that's a complicated issue is because
*  buffalo contain brucellosis. They have brucellosis, which can be very dangerous to domestic cattle.
*  And whether or not they transmit it to domestic cattle, the same argument could be said about elk.
*  They also occasionally have brucellosis and there's a lot of ranchers who want to shoot elk
*  that wind up eating their hay and eating their grass. So when these bison drift off of Yellowstone
*  and they go into public land or they go into private land, it's an issue of resources oftentimes.
*  Oh, you got to cull them. You have to cull them. I'm just thinking of this and I'm not a hunter.
*  Although interestingly, I went to Yellowstone again, right? This is this whole, I'm not sure
*  about stuff. I didn't know anything about hunting. I assumed hunting was, I don't know, bad.
*  People go out, they kill endangered species, right? Whatever I had seen, that was it. And when I went
*  to Yellowstone, when I discovered that Doug Smith, who's the guy that reintroduced wolves to
*  Yellowstone, he was like, I hunt. And my first reaction was, what? I thought you loved animals.
*  How could this man who cares about nature? And what became clear, as you know and many hunters know,
*  is that it doesn't work like that. Hunting doesn't mean you don't care about nature. It doesn't mean
*  you don't care about animals. And that was a real, that was a wake-up call for me that I didn't
*  understand how people relate to the natural world and that I had been fed a kind of,
*  I don't know, oversimplified, ultra-processed version of what it was to hunt. At the same time
*  with those bison, you got to cull them, right? So you got to get rid of them. And like you said,
*  resource, you don't want them wandering on a rancher's land. And that's something that
*  the people in Yellowstone will, activists are happy to tell you, yes, these kinds of things
*  are problems. As a hunter though, I imagine that you wouldn't be super excited to just camp out
*  and shoot a bison as it wandered into, slowly into, I don't know, would you?
*  It would only be for meat. It would be that you wanted organic meat and you wanted to be able to
*  do it that way. But not the excitement of what you were talking about. No, it wouldn't be predator
*  versus prey and it wouldn't be what you would call fair chase. Right. You know, and that's, I mean,
*  it would be technically fair chase because the animal does wander out, but you have to admit
*  that those animals have been grossly domesticated. I mean, when we were in Yellowstone, bison were
*  everywhere. You could just stand there and stare at them. I brought binoculars, I was handing them
*  to my kids and they're standing like, look at this one over here. And they're like, you know,
*  they weren't even remotely concerned about us. I mean, that's also why a 70 year old woman was
*  gored just three days ago because this crazy lady decided she wanted to take a selfie with a
*  fucking bison. You know, there are wild animals. I mean, they are wild, but they're not wild like
*  a wild animal. They're not wild like a wild animal that doesn't have a real relationship with people.
*  But bison, this is where it's tricky. When there was no Yellowstone and when there was
*  no, you know, no place where they could be domesticated, they were still an easy animal
*  to hunt. They've always been easy because they're so big that they're not concerned about wolves.
*  They're not concerned about anything. In fact, one of the ways that Native Americans would hunt them
*  is they would kill wolves and they would wear a wolf coat and they would crawl around like a wolf
*  or coyote cult. So they would put it on their head and they would walk on all fours up close to it
*  and then shoot it with a bow and arrow. And there's actually a famous painting of this Wild West
*  famous painting of these two Native American hunters that are wearing these coyote skins
*  and they're crawling in this field up to these bison. And a friend of mine who was a hope,
*  my friend Remy Warren, who's a host of a television show called Apex Predator,
*  actually use this method to hunt a bison. You mean like a how to put on? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He actually put a coyote skin on and crawled up to a bison, to a free-range bison and hunted it this
*  way just to see if it would work just like this famous painting. So bison, one of the reasons why
*  they were able to almost extirpate them from the United States was that they're really easy to hunt
*  because they're not scared of anything. Nothing can fuck with them in the real world because in
*  the real wild world wolves can't fuck with bisons. They'll stomp a wolf. The wolf doesn't even have a
*  chance. Grizzly bears can and they have. And there's actually a video really recently from
*  about a month ago of a grizzly bear killing a bison in Yellowstone while all these people were
*  watching. There's cars parked and this fucking grizzly bear jumps on the back of a bison and
*  is bringing it down. It's a long, there it is right there. It's a long drawn out process too.
*  That's a small bison but you know big enough and this bear is fucking huge and look at this bear
*  is like I mean it's like that's probably like a two-year-old bison or something like that. It's
*  not like a full-grown bison but I mean this is all this this video is like seven minutes. How
*  long was it? It's 114. It's edited. Yeah so I mean you see him in all these different scenes.
*  These cut scenes and here he finally gets them and he kills them in this river but he's attacking
*  them on a bridge. He's attacking them on a road. It's a long drawn out process for this grizzly
*  bear to kill this bison. Yeah so they don't really have that much to worry about. Calves have to
*  worry. So this is the video. That's the excuse me the painting. Yeah. The famous painting and see
*  bisons have zero concern for wolves because they'll just stomp them. I mean they're they're enormous
*  animals and their hide can be like 12 inches thick of hair. I mean especially in the wintertime
*  like the Native Americans that would wear the bison robes like it was the most incredible
*  protection for from cold because you're you're wearing this insane natural thing that has
*  shielded bison to the point where they can just walk out in a blizzard. They don't give a fuck.
*  They're not even a little concerned about it. That painting and I was like that sounds familiar
*  like he's talking about that it was on the cover of a book called the Ecological Indian. I think
*  it's called by a guy named Shepherd Kretsch which is he was looking at the history. I mean for one
*  speaking of Native Americans and Yellowstone how crazy is it that because we think of natural
*  as not human involved one of the things to make Yellowstone natural is he got rid of all of the
*  like humans. Yeah right. That were living there. Yeah. Naturally. I mean I remember I went there
*  was actually when I was there there was a hunting blind that was left over from when Native Americans
*  were in Yellowstone. Yeah it was really cool. My guide showed me just like it's you know just a
*  little hunting blind that they would use and it it would also yeah again right. It made me realize
*  right. Yellowstone is not pure nature that even our understanding of of nature and naturalness.
*  If you get rid of like getting rid of humans right is getting rid of a part of the naturalness of
*  what this place was before or just having humans in cars in close proximity to these animals and
*  getting them conditioned to it that becomes unnatural. But even you know and or does it.
*  Well yeah I think it does. Right. I used to I I I would have wanted to say a long time ago oh no
*  there's no such difference. But yeah no man a road is less natural than no road. I don't know like
*  that. And the same thing happened with sports which was I mean with Yellowstone right there is more and
*  less natural right. And it would be sad if Yellowstone became much more unnatural. It would take
*  away from you know if they put in like an amusement park or whatever is they're trying to do to like
*  figure out how to raise funds at these places. And this it's because part of what we value about
*  Yellowstone even though it's impure and even though it's imperfect is that we get we get to see
*  something more natural than a zoo. Yeah than a zoo. Exactly far superior to a zoo. Exactly. Because
*  you can see that you can see a grizzly bear. No one's feeding the grizzly bears. The grizzly bear
*  has to eat by killing that bison. Right. That's far superior. And that's the same thing with the same
*  thing with sports. So like I that was another one of the things that really convinced me that I needed
*  to rethink my relationship with naturalness which is that you know so I went to a I went to a
*  natural bodybuilding competition. I know you had Ronnie Coleman on like I I'd never been to a
*  bodybuilding competition before. And so I went in and it was a natural bodybuilding competition.
*  And these you know these people were they had you could smell the spray tan from you know you know
*  I was I was in the I was in the room with them backstage. I was like these are the most unnatural
*  people I've ever seen. Right. They've been what is it called sodium cycling or something to like
*  cut their subcutaneous fat so that they I mean they've done everything you could possibly do
*  to get their bodies into this form. And I'm I'm I'm like what this is a great example. This was
*  going to be my example that I used to show that naturalness in sports was stupid because all it
*  really meant was that you weren't taking a certain list of drugs. Right. That's it. That's all it
*  meant. Everything else about it was unnatural right from the tans. But but the the truth is
*  that sports are about naturalness that they are a celebration of natural talent. There's no way you
*  know people call it God given talent right which is again the the connection between God and nature.
*  But you can't have sports as we understand them without thinking about them as a celebration of
*  what the human body can do right. When you see that guy Alex Honnold is that his name. Yeah. When
*  you see him free climbing like that. Yeah. A part of what you're thinking I think I mean it's not
*  just that he's like he could die. Right. But it's also like look at what the human body on on you
*  know unaided by anything else. Yeah. Look what it can do. And that's why we care when Elliot
*  Kipchoge you know when he runs when he runs his marathon record it makes sense to ask how much
*  was in the shoes. Right. Not because I could run that fast you know with those shoes. Explain what
*  you mean by that because. Yeah. So so so so when you're so you know setting a marathon record
*  there's an incredible marathoner named Elliot Kipchoge and there are these Nike had these new
*  shoes called Vaporflies and he was using these shoes and after he broke the marathon record just
*  shattered it. People were like wait a second how much of that can be attributed to him and how much
*  of it is just the technology in the shoes. Right. And this set off again one of these like back and
*  forth it was totally useless online where some people were like I can't believe you're taking
*  his accomplishment away from him and other people were like it's all you know it's obviously the
*  shoes. But but for me it's just a it's a broader conversation about well so what is it that we care
*  about in sports. Right. If you put a pair of shoes on someone and all of a sudden they're five percent
*  ten percent faster. That matters right. Jamie you actually know about this right. You were you're a
*  runner. What is what is. I have a version of how much they've made them. The pair he has is various
*  very very specific to what he was trying to do. Is that the pair he has. Yeah they tailored the
*  course to be specific. Oh yeah. They brought in top level pacers to to cycle in every like
*  hundred probably every mile. I don't know exactly how they did it but when they first started making
*  these pair of shoes they called they're called the four percent they made it made you four percent
*  faster. Really. There's like there was a thing like a titanium plate placed in the middle of it. So
*  like normal like even the shoe I have now you can you can bend this in half and whatnot. You can't
*  do this with that shoe. Because the plates as you hit it like launches you kind of forward like a
*  spring like like a it's not a spring so it's just a very minute assistance but you know the best
*  runner in the world it helped them get 159 40. They're actually selling these insoles that are
*  made out of carbon fiber. Similar to that. Yeah. Now that big ass heel on the back which is so
*  preposterous. My wife has a pair of those and I'm like what the fuck is that heel. At least seems so
*  crazy to walk around with that. They're really weird to walk around and I don't think I've ever
*  worn them here. I have a pair at home. They're specifically for running on the road fast. So on
*  the street. Not sprinting. Yeah. Yeah. So that's why it's got all the cushion. Right. They're very
*  specific for that. To protect your knees. Yeah. Yeah. So that's a real good question right. Is that
*  how much of a factor. I would think you would fucking you'd have to wear a regular pair of
*  shoes if you want to break a record. That's right. So this is that's exactly right. So then was right
*  and you would never do this with a mathematician right. You know if a mathematician had a new
*  proof right. You'd never be like now hold on a second. Were you drinking coffee. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Wait did you like no one no one cares like did you when you invented that new car.
*  What kind of substance. You want nootropics. Yeah. Exactly. No one cares because the way we evaluate
*  mathematical what we care about with a mathematical proof for a new invention
*  isn't showcasing the natural talent you know whatever that means because it's a tough thing
*  to you know the mathematician whereas with Kipchoge's record what we're wondering at in part
*  is what is he doing what is he doing in a way that is separate from what his shoes are doing.
*  And that means that in sports at least I have to admit that naturalness is an important factor.
*  It is an important factor but it's a weird one because it's not an even slate. It's not like a
*  it's not an even playing field like some people have just incredible genetic gifts
*  and some people don't. Now if a person doesn't and they take some creatine and a bunch of
*  different substances and they they get in a cryo tank every day after training and then they're in
*  a sauna every day and then they're doing all these different things where they're they have
*  electronics strapped to them to try to monitor their heart rate and make sure that they're
*  getting the exact right amount of training and no more and no less and that the recovery is
*  perfect before they train harder. How natural is that? Not very natural. That's the problem.
*  It's why you said the gift like isn't Phil Heath I mean I found out all this stuff but I think his
*  nickname is the gift and someone called Randy Coleman is that his name? Like like freak of
*  nature right? We'll say this about people. Ronnie Coleman. Sorry yeah he's like I mean people will
*  say like oh could I get like could you get built like that? Ronnie's the first to admit it yeah on
*  the podcast he talked about it pretty openly. Even with what Jew and whatever right this is like when
*  I talked with the natural bodybuilders backstage he was like man I don't if people want to juice
*  they can juice there's no way you know these people are still there you know Ronnie Coleman's
*  still like an incredible athlete. Well Ronnie didn't juice for the many many years into his
*  bodybuilding career and then once he started doing it he just he did it because he got tired
*  of losing to people that he didn't think he should lose to. Right and that but you know going back
*  to what you're saying which is true right is how natural is it if you're doing all of these things
*  so yes sports is impure right in the same way like how natural is Yellowstone there's a road
*  going through it you got these domesticated at the same time you can't take that criteria away
*  entirely right or I mean to give you an example right let's take a Marcus Rem or Oscar Pistorius
*  who people know about right. The guy with the no legs. The murderer with with uh with blades. South African runner.
*  That's right South African runner so you can't like you can't just let him put on any kind of leg
*  right right he can't have rocket launchers on his legs right that would be unfair and he can't have
*  like you know I don't know pistons and what exactly but and even let's imagine that like you could just
*  invent a leg with no mechanics in it right but it just made him incredibly fast much faster than any
*  human being you'd be like nope that's unfair we don't allow that. That is the argument about those
*  cheetah legs right. That's exactly right so then what do you have to do you have to test so a recent
*  case happened they allowed Pistorius in but there's a German guy uh Marcus Rem who also wanted to
*  compete and was using one of these legs and they did all these tests right and they ran tests on
*  you know they do these pressure plates it's really incredible what they do to see whether his leg
*  gives him an advantage over what a natural leg right so the baseline comparison here is does your
*  artificial leg give you an advantage over a natural leg and then but then whose natural leg
*  is it your natural leg or is Usain Bolt's natural leg well I think in his yeah exactly so in his
*  case it's uh that what they tried to do with these blades is they're like okay let's figure out
*  because he's you know all of these guys are world-class athletes right so it's if it's some weird
*  hypothetical right where if Marcus Rem had a leg would he be performing at about the same level as
*  he does with his artificial leg and that and and as weird as it is as paradoxical as it is
*  I think it makes sense right it makes sense in the same and it depends on the sport too like UFC I
*  looked this up so I was like I wonder if there's anyone with an artificial limb in UFC and then I
*  was thinking because I did judo and I was like wait a second that'd be crazy because like you
*  couldn't like you couldn't allow someone to have like a prosthetic arm because you couldn't you
*  couldn't like arm bar like you could you could just any pain yeah you wouldn't feel any pain so
*  unlike running where I can imagine it being fair to allow someone to have an artificial limb and
*  that that's what I mean it's like fair compared to a natural limb it would I can't imagine a
*  scenario in which a prosthetic arm or even a hand yeah or even a hand because it would be metal
*  that's exactly right you just beat the crap yeah you wouldn't break it no you would have to like
*  if someone had their hand replaced you'd have to literally engineer bones that had a breaking point
*  that were similar to organic bones exactly natural right so you're to engineer it to be
*  like less good than carbon fiber bones right you'd have to make it worse yeah and then you'd have
*  scientists right you'd have you would have usc fighters who are like no I still think the
*  prosthetic hand is giving this given this person an advantage right and then that person would be
*  like well we got to call in the scientists and they're gonna like do all these bone breaking
*  tests you know which is what they did with with these two athletes which is what which is what
*  they're doing also with transgender athletes who want to compete it's the same kind of logic right
*  which is what what is the what's the comparison between say and in the case of a a transgender
*  woman who is competing what's the baseline natural comparison in other words does being a transgender
*  woman give you an advantage over being a biological woman the only difference is there's an inclination
*  towards allowing them to compete because it makes you seem more progressive there's a there's a
*  motivation to allowing transgender women athletes to compete because if you look at the oppressive
*  you know if you if you have an oppression scale they are one level or two levels past being a
*  biological woman being a biological woman is more oppressed than being a biological when a woman
*  kicks a man's ass we're all happy when a man kicks a woman's ass we're very upset right well with it
*  with yeah i mean i think i think there is right now in this cultural moment i think there's in
*  the same way that there was you know i mean women didn't box in the olympics until 2012 because for
*  a long time it was thought that women aren't they're not naturally suited to boxing right i
*  think the first sports they played in the olympics were i don't think they did like sailing and
*  gymnastics um i mean even later earlier like the very earliest olympics there weren't any the guy
*  who founded the olympics was like not women women will just you know women will stay out of this and
*  right now i mean i think you're right that there is because sports are so symbolically important
*  right i mean you see this with everything with colin kapernick with whatever sports are really
*  important to people sports you know sports stars are heroes and so i do think that a part of
*  the transgender rights movement is going to be securing the ability for transgender athletes
*  to compete under their the gender that they identify as and i understand that i think it
*  makes sense i think it makes sense to want that because you want cultural representation at the
*  same time i don't think you're going to find maybe you'll nut pick them right you can find them online
*  you're not going to find a lot of athletes who think that there shouldn't be any regulations
*  on how transgender athletes compete in other words there are very few people who are actually
*  involved in the olympics right like they're setting up the rules or whatever i mean i talked with a
*  transgender scientist named uh joanna harper about this who studies the differences between
*  transgender athletes and athletes who identify as their biological sex and there's no way she would
*  say it doesn't matter let anyone compete without any regulations so the the real question on the
*  ground i think that people are arguing about is not whether there should be regulations but what
*  regulations should there be and that question i mean i don't know how i mean you probably follow
*  this a lot but like same question is like what do you do with testosterone levels right so so
*  duty chand right um let's say you are hyper androgynous but your xx chromosome yeah explain
*  that woman who's this is the the issue with her yeah so so one of the things that people try to
*  do in sports because it's important to have there's some philosophers will argue it's not but i think
*  it's crazy um it's important to have men's sports and women's sports right it's important because
*  sports are symbolically important and we want to have women competing at the very highest levels
*  and we want men competing at the very highest levels and there's a you know there's a significant
*  there's a significant yeah it's plus or minus 10 they've studied this right depending on the sport
*  right so you know powerlifting it's a huge difference um there's certain sports where
*  it's not like ultra-marathoning that's why the ioc is banned transgender athletes from competing
*  in powerlifting so so that's this this stuff is it's important to have these categories right but
*  then how do you distinguish so going back to duty chand right so if you make a testosterone rule
*  for example so you can only have testosterone you know you can only compete as a woman if your
*  testosterone is below a particular level that's the problem with that is they would have to test
*  it every day and they would have to test it multiple times a day because it's not just how
*  it is when you're competing it's what it's like when you're training so how much recovery how
*  much muscle have you retained there's there's a lot of factors well and the fact that there are
*  women who are who are ex-x who are hyper androgynous right and that's just like i mean
*  we're talking about being a freak of nature right or having a gift there's people with high blood
*  cell counts right there's people with really long arms or you know wet hands or whatever
*  so it's like well and this woman actually made her argument and i totally i mean it's incredible
*  it's really powerful when you read it she's like here i am i have naturally high testosterone
*  and they're gonna tell me that i have to artificially lower my natural testosterone levels
*  so that i can compete in the olympics and when i'm reading that it's a particularly sexist argument
*  because um they don't do that with men right there's men that have competed in the olympics
*  that have naturally high testosterone and you know they've dominated other men and particularly
*  in wrestling you know like if you see like do you know where alexander korelin is no alexander
*  korelin is a very famous russian wrestler who they used to call the experiment because his parents
*  are both like five five and five seven they're like smaller folks and he's fucking enormous and
*  he's terrifying go to go to that picture that i put on my instagram i put up a picture on my
*  instagram that i i look at this picture every couple you know months or so just to remind
*  myself what a tremendous pussy i am oh my god that's korelin korelin used to take men i mean
*  we're talking about men that were 300 pounds and they would flatten themselves out on the ground
*  to try to avoid being picked up by him and he would scoop his hands under their belly and hoist
*  them up in the air like they were a pillow and throw them onto the ground literally look at
*  that picture of him with the red shirt the one right there no right there look at the size of
*  that motherfucker i mean just unstoppable for years and years in the olympics and i mean i don't know
*  whether that's science or nature but if it's just nature you can't tell me that this guy doesn't
*  have some kind of crazy genetic advantage that the average man just does not and that's what we
*  celebrate right i mean that's what we love seeing some ways yeah you know when we watch sports i'm
*  sure alex honnold like he probably has some kind of genetic thing where he's just not scared
*  no of the same stuff or he loves being scared whatever it is right i don't think it's genetic
*  at all with alex i've had alex on a couple of times really what does he just love it he's uh
*  really loves climbing and he the way he says it he's like you're you're in control and it's pretty
*  mellow he's like when you know that's how he talks he talks like really you know really calm and
*  smooth and that's how he he climbs he's like if there's a thrill something's really wrong
*  like if i feel like if there's an actual thrill i'm kind of fucked he goes everything is very
*  mellow it's very slow and very mellow that's not that is not built into me i'd be absolutely
*  i just thought it's terrifying that his his his managing of that environment and that sort of
*  situation is part of the thrill of it for him it's trained it's trained or something yes for sure
*  i mean he's been climbing forever it's the ability to stay calm and where he's at least subcon well
*  he's consciously aware of the consequences of slipping and falling but he's a he's figured
*  out a way to stay in this zone and there's some sort of a tremendous reward in staying in this
*  zone so much so that he wants to do without any aid he wants to do without any ropes would you
*  be disappointed if you and i'm thinking about how i would feel too as i asked this question
*  if you found out that he took some kind of downer to like keep himself calm on the mountain like if
*  you found this like the steroid version yeah you know yeah exactly uh yeah i mean beta blockers
*  are real i mean beta blockers are a real problem in the world of competitive archery really yeah
*  yeah but they take beta blockers too so that when you know the shit's on the on the line and this
*  is like the final match and they're looking at a 60 meter target they just stay calm and they can
*  keep their arms steady and let that arrow fly i didn't know that but that's another great example
*  of what is it that you care about well a part of it is you're like okay under normal right what is
*  this person's natural ability or what is their non-chemical or whatever it is right whatever
*  you want to call it i've never taken beta blockers um i actually i got them prescribed for me to me
*  once by a doctor because i wanted to try them and i wound up never trying them i just wanted to see
*  what it was like to do something i just for my own curiosity i want to see what it was like to do
*  something nerve-wracking but while i was on beta blockers yeah i was going to use them on a hunting
*  trip but i didn't because i felt like i would be disappointed in myself if i did that which is really
*  crazy because on a hunting trip you would think the most important thing is making an ethical shot
*  but i was my thought process was i trained so hard to make an ethical shot and to to be accurate
*  and to to practice my my my shot making routine till it's it's like drilled into my head i don't
*  want to take a pill so i just and i i don't even there i still have them somewhere i don't i don't
*  even know if they're any good because they're like six years old but i i want to know what that feels
*  like it would probably feel really weird to have no adrenaline when you know you should you know and
*  and like what you were saying too is it takes away there are certain experiences you know where part
*  of what you value about the experience is how you know how you how you managed it and how you train
*  yourself like you said right you don't want it to be a pill yeah that did it and that's and sports
*  is one of those things whereas it would be crazy to you know to think to yourself well i'll give
*  you an example this is it's funny right childbirth right so it'd be crazy to go in the dentist office
*  and be like you know i'd be really disappointed in myself if the way i manage this filling is by
*  using uh you know no yeah novocaine right it's like i just be i'd be really sad about myself uh
*  you know please don't give me anything i'm gonna i'm gonna handle it myself that's insane to me
*  at least um but people do that with childbirth yeah because childbirth like sports is one of those
*  experiences where a part of what some people want is a sense of kind of primal connection
*  and that was something i didn't understand i thought it was totally i was like why would anyone ever
*  want to experience like you could just have an epidural yeah you know yeah you could just have
*  no no pain right well that would be better right that's like a great option right you know yeah um
*  but but like you were saying right so with sports but back to duty chan right because i think this
*  is really important because this is going to come up and in our cultural environment it's going to
*  be nuts right and i want people i hate the like i hate how bad the conversations are honestly about
*  transgender athletes because they are so binary and so simplistic that i think that they're going to
*  sides yeah on both sides that they're going to be there that that when there is actually an athlete
*  competing in the olympics who is transgender it's going to happen soon it's going to rip everyone
*  apart and and instead what what i would like to see is people who understand the complexity of
*  stuff like being an excess af you know xx athlete with hyper androgyny or alternatively right so say
*  you do it with chromosomes so now you're xy if you're you know for the sake of sports hypothetically
*  we're going to define you as a woman if you're xx and a man if you're xy but then you've got people
*  who are xy but androgen insensitive so these are people who biologically essentially grow up
*  as as women and they look like women they compete as women and then they have a chromosome they have
*  a test right and they find out that they're xy but they're androgen insensitive and this has been this
*  was an issue in the olympics well in 1985 there was a woman who's now a physician who had been
*  competing as a woman her whole life then the test came back and she was like well that's crazy was
*  she hermaphrodite she was not i mean i as i understand it she was just androgen insensitive
*  so she was not intersex this woman wasn't so did she have a penis she did not so she had a vagina
*  that's correct but she had a y chromosome that's right wow right so but then what ends up happening
*  and again i've read so many of these arguments and i want people to have interesting discussions
*  about this is people will say they'll look at this and and on one side of the argument people
*  will be like well then she was just you know if it's x you know if it's x x y she's a man that's
*  it like she's just a man without a penis right this is the outlier of all outliers right so people use
*  outliers to try to break down all of the category on the other side people will be like well since
*  there are outliers clearly the categories themselves don't make sense but that's not true either right
*  obviously the categories for sports of biological males and biological females are very important
*  categories that do make sense and there are also outliers that make it hard to decide yeah that's
*  it that's the and then we have a conversation about the difficulties with the outliers and we
*  and we try to at least you know for my part we try to embrace the the complexity of those situations
*  yeah it's it's so weird with sports because with sports first of all um did you ever see the
*  documentary Icarus yes amazing yes well it highlights if you haven't seen it folks it
*  highlights how prevalent cheating is it's really and so when you're talking about sports you're
*  talking about people that are willing to first of all push their body literally to the brink of
*  failure for success and then they're also willing to take exogenous drugs to succeed then they're
*  also in this case Russia was complicit in aiding them and perhaps even forcing them to do this and
*  they had this elaborate system set up at the Sochi Olympics to cheat and so when you're talking about
*  sports that's part of the thing it's like people are law they're everyone wants fair right they're
*  looking for fairness but what the fuck is fairness it's it's very very difficult it's very weird
*  and this is something that you know I've admitted openly with this the transgender argument
*  the there are outliers and there's outliers that are female athletes like first of all African
*  American females have the same bone density as a lot of caucasian men the bone density arguments
*  a weird one because men generally have thicker bone density particularly men that lift weights
*  have a denser denser bones than females but some women have dense bones you know there's some women
*  like there's some women fighters that have real knockout power and then there's some women fighters
*  that just don't they just don't for whatever reason structurally they don't generate the same
*  amount of force like what's fair what is fair because there's there's some people that are just
*  gifted they're just gifted physically this is why sports is so weird and I don't know I have no idea
*  how things break I don't know how things break down along racial lines but with with men and women
*  it's it's a particularly clear thing and it's also something that we have as a category right so then
*  that forces the question on us in a way that that is difficult right like you were saying what is
*  fair they're all they're every single athlete at world class level in a certain sense is a freak
*  of nature right they are all they all have certain kinds of gifts many of them many many of them are
*  freaks of just will and determination right and and that means that fairness is going to be a
*  really really hard thing to pin down and like you said too right they're going to be have training
*  regimens they're going to be taking all kinds of supplements they're going to be doing all of these
*  things that are obviously you know not natural but at the same time we want to have rules about what
*  kind of shoes they can wear right and and what kind of drugs they can take and and sports are so
*  important to people right they're so they're so so symbolically important that I just I get I get
*  scared honestly I get scared I mean this brings us back sort of to the beginning of the conversation
*  but I get really scared about the way in which people are going to be able to ultra process
*  whatever happens and this is on every side of the debate what's going to happen is people are going
*  to going to take whatever they see and they're going to go nuts with it right but that's that's
*  sort of on them it sucks but it is sort of on them we we really should be embracing these nuanced
*  discussions because this is what's critical for understanding the the true nature of things and
*  these people that are willfully distorting people's messages and taking these ultra processed
*  versions whether it's a clip or soundbite or even worse in in quotes a segment with dot dot dot at
*  the end the the idea that you you can do that and and reframe what is really a really nuanced
*  conversation where people are exploring the very nature of all things you know whether it's farming
*  or athletics or pollination or especially like your your book which is really what I've read of
*  it's really fantastic the idea behind it is it's such an important thing to discuss because we do
*  have this binary idea of natural and unnatural processed and this you know it's on them if they
*  want to do that like it sucks that people do do that and that they pretend that your argument is
*  different than it really is but that's on you you're you're just being a fool like it's it
*  sucks that so many people get sucked into these kind of debates in these conversations but you
*  can't do that to someone face to face you can't have that conversation with someone in a real
*  setting of sitting down talking looking at each other eye to eye because that's the only way
*  people are really supposed to be talking you can't do it but it's not i mean even if it's on them
*  sort of morally doesn't it i mean it worries me because it ends up changing society it ends up
*  changing people's lives for sure some people get fired for deception for the same reason because
*  people are deceptive about what they meant and what they were trying to portray or also that
*  someone can just make a statement and instead of there being a discussion about that statement
*  they're fired and their life is ruined and they're publicly shamed and then we get to share it and
*  laugh and mock them whether it's through an article or a video like that girl with the finger cut
*  or the black lives matter girl or we end up focused on stupid shit right it's like right now
*  like just to take the current example like police reform yes right i think that what happens is we
*  get distracted and divided by fringe issues that are fed by the ultra processed information so we
*  end up focusing on them which makes it very difficult to actually and politicians like you
*  were saying right they're looking at this and they're like okay i'm gonna have to weigh in on
*  those issues and so that ends up dividing politicians when in fact people agree on a lot of things
*  they agree on a lot of things people want for example with the police right as i understand
*  the vast majority of americans want police held accountable for using excessive violence yes
*  it may be it maybe it is on people for for eating the wrong information it's on me or whatever
*  becoming polarized but but it ends up making us as a society incapable of getting together and
*  making the changes that we actually all agree on if we only if we were only able to sit down
*  and talk i don't think it's on people that eat the wrong information i think that's very unfortunate
*  it's on the people who distribute the information deceptively the people that are distorting willfully
*  distorting you're like someone like you're saying if we have this conversation look we've talked
*  about a bunch of hot button subjects that could get us cancelled and you could take any segment
*  of a conversation like that and likely find a few things that people could take out of context
*  and it would it would spur this whole debate on what a piece of shit you are and this is something
*  that people like to do for whatever reason they like to willfully distort a nuanced discussion
*  and take a segment out of context and change the narrative and and turn it into something it's not
*  that's on them that is on them it's on it's not on the people that listen to it and and get sucked
*  into it i feel for them and i'm sorry and i i don't enjoy it when it happens to me but the people who
*  do that willfully you are wasting your life distorting reality because you wish things
*  to be a different way or because you're deceptive or because you're bitter or spiteful or angry or
*  hateful or you see in you this other person that you're you're targeting you see in them something
*  that you don't like in yourself or something in a past lover or something in your father or whatever
*  the fuck it is you know that's on you that's on you i can't i can't worry about that there's not
*  enough time in this life yeah no it's it's i do agree with i think you're right to like focus on
*  so i'm gonna tell you let me tell you a story about about a about a terrible person um there's
*  there's we should have some cue up some spooky music yeah right so this there's this guy i hope
*  i like don't get sued by this guy well you don't just don't say his name yeah well i'm gonna i'm
*  about to say the place that he runs um this is a guy who tells people that he can cure their cancer
*  yeah yeah uh you know cure their cancer naturally right he's got the whole you know he gives him he
*  gives him a wheat you know gives him wheatgrass smoothies right and he tells him that if they
*  just think positively and and they you know the that big pharma is is corrupt and chemotherapy is
*  a sham and if they just come to his place which i went to in in florida um he's you go to interview
*  him i did i did i went to interview him because and he looks like i mean he just looks like he he's
*  like a caricature of a snake oil salesman he's got this like artificially tan skin and like a
*  pointy goatee and and and the and and and so i think you're totally right i guess on this guy
*  this this fucked up guy who is who is getting people's hope up right it's not right because
*  it's also he gets to the people and they could have seeked sought out real they treatment yeah
*  could be cured and live and people die people die because they go there and the people that were
*  there this was the crazy thing and this is this again gets back to how the ultra-processed
*  information is happening these were not idiots man these were people who i mean i don't know
*  what it's like um because i've never had i've never had you know knock on wood i've never
*  you know i've never had cancer a person very close to me has never had cancer but like these are
*  people who you know when that happens um you're looking for anyone you're looking for anyone to
*  tell you a story that gives you a sense that things are actually not chaotic right that things are
*  simple that there's an answer that there's a community that that can help you um and so and
*  so they go right and he and he taps he taps into that and he gives them what they want right in a
*  sense he gives them what they want which is which is a feeling of certainty and belonging and hope
*  and and he's terrible terrible human being but but but it ends up it ends up being really
*  bad for these people and it ends up being bad for you know society in certain ways and that
*  and so i struggle right and the problem is if you attack that guy i don't know if you've run into
*  this at all but if you attack the charlatans they've been turned into saints by the people
*  that look up to them so when you attack them you also end up attacking all of the people that
*  believe them that believe yeah i've been there before with chiropractors yeah wait so what say
*  a little more well i don't know if you know the history of chiropractors i do i just want to i
*  have to figure out where you come down on this before i think it's nonsense yeah okay it's 100
*  nonsense it's this ready yeah me cracking my fingers that's what they're doing to your back
*  it's not fixing anything chiropractic medicine was created by a guy who was a magnetic healer
*  who came about it through a seance the idea that he was going to manipulate people's spines and
*  cure them of tuberculosis and blindness he was murdered by his son who drove over him with a
*  fucking car and then took over the practice and somehow or another this has been grandfathered in
*  like what i told this to a friend of mine the other day was talking to me about chiropractors
*  i go do you know how much time a chiropractor spends in medical school they go how much i go
*  zero yeah zero time they're a doctor of chiropractic medicine but they're not a doctor there's people
*  flipping out right now though who have been to their chiropractor who have feel like they've
*  gotten relief we respect their crack yeah yeah well there's some relief in someone manipulating
*  your body folks you should get a deep tissue massage and you should get an mri and find out
*  what's really wrong i came through this because i used to go to a doctor chiropractor excuse me
*  and i had a bulging disc and it was fucking me up for a long time it was really bothering me
*  and this this chiropractor was assuring me it definitely was not a bulging disc and there's
*  probably a muscle tear and we're going to fix it by manipulating this i'm going to change your that
*  and crack and see oh i got it there let me adjust this boom in your hip this it was all horseshit
*  but he was a saint compared to another one that i went to i'll tell you a story about a guy who
*  is ripping people off this guy was really ripping people off he was doing this thing that he called
*  zone healing are you ready for this he would i'm not bullshitting he would touch your head
*  and he would he would press your head here and press your head here press your head here and then
*  press it really hard here and he goes oh you feel that and i go yeah and he'll be like yeah that's
*  that's uh l4 is off and this i mean no you squeezed hard on my fucking head i'm not stupid and then
*  he would adjust you and tell you that this is going to fix you know whatever autoimmune disease
*  you have whatever this and so i was going to him because all these other jujitsu people were going
*  to him and they were all telling me oh this guy's great at cracking backs and he's he's amazing he
*  fixed my neck he fixed my this because people want someone to fix their thing right if you have a
*  neck injury and you just spend time off and it gets better and you get some treatment from a
*  chiropractor well heal things heal your body knows how to heal and he goes oh he fixed my neck no
*  your fucking neck healed okay things do heal but this person touching your back saying he's fixing
*  your gallbladder is a scam artist right so i had this guy and i'm talking to him and so i said well
*  how does this work he's explaining to me he's got a chart this is zone he is how we're fixing this
*  and that and that and this and i said but all you're doing is pushing down on my back how are you
*  fixing all these things and so he tries to give me the shenanigans and a little song and dance hey
*  hey and i keep going and i say how are you fixing this you tell me what is going on here and so it
*  goes down to the placebo method he literally tells me oh he said if you believe if you believe in
*  these things i go so you're telling me i have to be so fucking dumb to think that if you push on my
*  back it's going to fix my liver and then it will fix my liver well he goes well you do know the
*  placebo method does work i go so you're taking money from people to lie to them so we have this
*  tense conversation in his office and i'm looking at him and i know this guy's got a nice house and
*  he's got a nice car and he's just fucking stealing money from people by giving him these false hopes
*  it's it's creepy shit man and it's really creepy shit when you're alone with the guy and you're
*  talking to him about it and you get him to say it's the placebo method and meanwhile other than
*  that nice guy which is even more fucked up like i knew him like he seemed like a nice guy i didn't
*  i didn't know i didn't even know chiropractor stuff was bullshit i mean the history of it's i mean like
*  you said right if you look into it it's sort of hard to believe that people like it's still a
*  thing it's hard i mean it's insurance covers it yeah and it's and it you know and this goes back
*  to the religion stuff too i mean i got all i got into all of this stuff so i like my my actual
*  area of academic expertise is classical chinese philosophy so like that's what i that's what i
*  did as an act do did do as an academic and i you know i read all these ancient daoist texts and
*  stuff like that and there's all these promises in there about you know if you take my you know
*  mercury mixed at night with this and you eat in this way and i'm looking at this stuff and i was
*  like you know this seems very familiar right there's a lot of that going on today and then
*  you look at the history of chiropractic and it's there are these vital forces right homeopathy is
*  a similar thing there's vital forces that are actually what's causing illness and if you look
*  at the history of that it's quasi-religious reiki which is like the oh my god energy healing right
*  and it's like they didn't even touch you right right and it's these words i mean it's really
*  interesting these words energy is one of these words that can easily slide from explicitly
*  religious to seemingly secular right it's like oh yeah energy that's in physics they have energy
*  right but it's like no this is a thing they're not manipulating your energy there's not something
*  scientific happening here this is a this is a religious ritual a healing ritual disguised
*  as some kind of science right and and and yet as you know and this is what i discovered with my
*  first book i used to joke with people like i got out of religion because i didn't want to talk about
*  touchy stuff and then i started talking about food and medicine and that was when people really got
*  pissed like when you when you start to talk about what they eat so you got out of religion just
*  because you didn't want these uncomfortable conversations i'm joking i it's not i actually
*  got i i got i stopped doing religion like or not stopped doing because i still do scholarship
*  stuff um but i wanted to talk about it in a way that was relevant to modern society so i didn't
*  just want to do classical chinese thought i wanted to look at how the stuff i learned about how
*  religion works or about the history of religion and apply it to you know how are people choosing
*  the foods they eat how are people choosing the medicines like with chinese medicine right people
*  would say crazy stuff to me they'd say things like you know acupuncture is natural right or whatever
*  and that's and that's part of why it works i'm like acupuncture they got stainless steel filoform
*  needles you think those who are around when the yellow emperor was writing his classic like
*  no they don't and when people talk about chinese medicine they don't talk about you know exorcism
*  exorcism is not a thing it was very popular back in the day but that's not something people
*  embrace and so i saw these weird uncritical embraces of of dietary regimens and healing
*  rituals that to me were just obviously right out of you know ancient china or you know any
*  ancient context um where people would never believe them and yet today you know you're going in and
*  you're having your your back cracked it's so weird that it's so prevalent but push back on it and oh
*  i've experienced it i'm gonna experience it now oh no just 100 well i don't read social media luckily
*  so i'm not gonna hear from it but and let me do say this there's a bunch of people that are
*  chiropractors that do use some valid methods for rehabilitation right there's a lot of them that
*  use deep tissue massage cold laser therapy actual real methods a lot of them use ralphing there's a
*  lot of them that use a bunch of different methods of stretching that are very beneficial but the
*  practice of cracking backs to cure disease is fucking nonsense right right and that's a problem
*  and the practice of calling yourself a doctor of that is also nonsense it really is yeah and it's
*  a problem yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely uh it's but at the same time again and i don't know you
*  i keep saying you know this but like it's it's it must be difficult when people are in pain
*  right or when people when people are in pain when you're in pain either you know psychic pain or
*  physical pain you really need someone to tell you they have an answer for you and to explain it and
*  fit it into a system they can say to you i know why you're sad i know why you feel empty i know
*  why your fucking back hurts it's because of this simple thing and i have the answer i'm gonna fix
*  it i'm gonna fix it and and actually just hearing that itself is therapeutic it really is and that's
*  the the problem with going to a healer because there's many people that have gone to people that
*  have claimed to be a healer and just this process of embracing this new new situation
*  that's like i am here i'm getting healed oh my god it's happening and you're a lot of what makes
*  people ill is anxiety is stress and the placebo effect of having some sort of a in your mind
*  perceived solution does have tangible physical benefits for some strange reason which is really
*  weird like what what goes on in the human mind there is an unbelievably crazy thing on i think
*  it's a netflix special it's a guy who's a magician a professional magician but he also comes from
*  like a religious background where he would go to these faith healing revivals and he does a show
*  where he tells his audience this flat out he says i'm a magician i specialize in manipulating your
*  minds and i know that the way that faith healing works is bullshit and i'm gonna show you by faith
*  healing people tonight in this audience i'm gonna do it right now but i want you to know that i'm
*  just manipulating you right is it darren brown is it is that his name and then he like goes and
*  heals people is it is darren's been on the pocket he's amazing i mean this was i'm watching them
*  and they're going up and he's like and was it your back and was it this and they're like oh my god
*  how did you know i feel better i've never felt this good in my life and it's it's it's unbelievable
*  really because you realize that certain forms of communication right are just inherently powerful
*  they're symbolically powerful and they can make people feel yeah it is dan brown yeah he's been
*  oh my god brown's amazing i mean it's just unbelievable yeah he's he's a really brilliant
*  human being in in many ways and uh and talking to him about his process of how long he sets these
*  things up and some of the things that he um he he's done several of these netflix specials
*  incredible he's amazing this is what people do with natural stuff though this is what they do
*  yes you go into a store you're stressed out you don't know what's going on you've got a chronic
*  condition there is a way in which buying something natural and consuming it the ritual of that
*  says to you you're going to be better you're a part of a system that is simple in which there
*  are good things and bad things and there's a solution to your problems but there is also
*  the reality of some natural foods being incredibly good for you that's true and there's also the
*  reality of some diets being incredibly poor in nutrients and the really the the result of that
*  of eating those diets is you get really sick and if you eat the nutrient rich diets your body turns
*  around that's true too that's also true that's exactly this is i wish that that the that's true
*  too yeah that's i'm i like yeah that's exactly it and that's and that's where i mean you know
*  what's weird is that most of the experts i talked with for for my book they were actually nuanced
*  you know i talked to environmental activists who were you know they are they are activists right
*  they really want to change the world for the better they care a lot about this stuff but
*  they're also very nuanced like you know nuclear energy is a complicated issue like here's why i
*  think it's complicated or here's why genetically modified organ they were always relentlessly
*  stressing how nuanced things are and how complicated things are and i feel like if there's one thing
*  although now i'm making it simple right but if there's one thing that's gonna look the one thing
*  that will fix everything is nuance it's sort of a stupid take that's a funny way of putting it right
*  yeah but nuance and not being married to your ideas is very very important yeah so let's not
*  hold people accountable yeah all right but that's that's a big part of why people are using the
*  internet they're trying to score points and and and shoot people down and cancel people and expose
*  people and get mad at people and they're doing it to elevate themselves it's a big part of why they're
*  doing it and really it's just you're robbing yourself of time and focus and energy that you
*  can be spending on important things and this is not again to say like what you were talking about
*  before about exposing police brutality or corruption these are important things to expose
*  that are really they're really like there's people are being victimized but that's not what we're
*  talking about here what we're talking about this is a general human tendency to tear people down
*  and it's it's very negative and it's and it feels like you should be doing it for some strange
*  reason while you're doing it there's like some satisfaction like if you have a rock you see a
*  window and you just fucking chuck that rock at the window and it smashes and a bunch of people
*  behind you go yeah it feels good you know and i don't know why it's part of being a person it's
*  the same it's the it's the same reason i guess like eating you know eating junk food feels good
*  right it's like they've it's tapped into all of these things and you know but it's right just use
*  the internet to find out about stuff like you like just even in this show right how many times have
*  we been able to bring up a video of something or a shot of something it was constructive i learned
*  things you know what i mean like there are plenty of ways to use the internet well and i do think
*  you're right we got to hold people okay if people are fucking designing social media
*  to make it compulsively addictive i mean that's like we didn't think there's anything wrong with
*  that when it was first instituted that's the problem i mean i was it i remember i was it i was
*  undergrad at stanford when facebook was first happening like this guy like smoked bulls with
*  and played guitars now like the like developed the facebook feed you know and i went back then
*  devil you know yeah well that and it's he didn't know what he was doing i'm sure you know he was
*  just like some kid who's like this is incredible right but then they didn't design it they didn't
*  design it with everybody's best interest in mind they didn't design it to to really make sure that
*  people would use it the right way and not the wrong way effective that's right yeah well that's the
*  thing about the youtube algorithm my friend ari had this uh experiment that he did was people were
*  talking about the youtube algorithm that it sort of there's one thing about facebook and youtube
*  and a lot of these things people will make this argument that the algorithm favors arguments it
*  favors it pulls up things that you get upset with particularly facebook and that it's trying to
*  manipulate you into using it much more often because it turns out that people engage much
*  more in things they disagree with than things they agree with so what he decided to do was only youtube
*  puppies and so he just youtube all these videos of puppies and all just so his feed was just filled
*  with puppy stuff and all his suggestions were puppy stuff and he's like no it's not that
*  it's trying to make you upset it's that you're trying to make yourself upset and it's taking
*  advantage of that it well yes this goes to salatin something salatin talked about here's another
*  analogy i think for information that's really helpful monocultures versus polycultures right
*  i think that that our current information ecosystem is set up to give us all a monoculture
*  of information it's like okay here's what this person wants i'm just going to feed them
*  a lot of puppies and only puppies here's the information this person wants i'm going to feed
*  them more of that and what you end up is a homogenization of what it is that's coming
*  into you when what you need is a kind of intellectual polyculture right you want something resilient
*  where there's people you know where there's where there's different systems in place so that you
*  don't just have one big system so that you can have other ideas i mean intellectually this is
*  what comedians often did right or jesters i mean this is something i work on academically is this
*  idea like you know you have the king and the king is the authority but the king will have a jester
*  who has the right to push back on the most fundamental things that the king believes in
*  and puts out there they can like you know and in general right the fool or the jester is wise
*  because they can challenge you take off their pants in public right and piss or they can do
*  things that no one else gets to do that's important because it prevents monoculture
*  intellectual and moral monoculture and i honestly think i mean i think you were talking about south
*  park the other day um but one thing that i have i struggle with now is that i feel like the jesters
*  these days they're just confirming what it is that their viewers already believe so with south park i
*  didn't know whether i was going to agree with what they were mocking or whether i was going to be
*  shocked you never knew gross generalization though in terms of jesters because there's so many
*  different styles of uh comedians like you can access them in a way that makes it so that you
*  don't have to hear anything you don't want but you don't know what they're going to say i kind of know
*  what john oliver is going to say well john oliver is a different kind of an animal and his stand-up
*  is what he's doing is not really stand up right what he's doing is he's got this show where he
*  mocks things and it's got a very heavy left wing bend to it right well john stewart i felt like i
*  knew what john stewart was going to say and it's not to say i didn't like it he was funny and i
*  agreed with him and i watched him i mean a lot of maybe this is just what people you know
*  conservatives say this and i think they're right is that there's a bent to late night like i'm not
*  going to tune into stephen colbert and be shocked that that he's mocking something that i didn't
*  expect him to mock well what's interesting that's true but colbert is a he's a catholic
*  yeah heavy duty catholic which is really weird i wish he would talk about that more he has a
*  few times does he gets real weird it gets like like almost like he's holding a hot potato and
*  he can't wait to drop it you know i wonder if i wonder if that's because it doesn't fit with the
*  i don't know i don't know man i mean first of all there was the character that he was doing
*  you know when he was doing the colbert report which was this like really cocky republican
*  character and then he went over to do the steven colbert show and now it's not that anymore now
*  it's like he's hosting a talk show but it's the guy that we knew who was like super ultra cocky
*  and really funny from the daily show that was like a parody of a right wing guy it's it's very odd
*  it's a weird it's a weird progression i wonder that you think that there are gestures because i
*  want to although i think he's very funny yeah he's hilarious well that's the thing being
*  being funny doesn't you know there are plenty of funny people who aren't jesters right i mean
*  there's i like when he fucks with trump i think it's hilarious that he gets trump to reply and
*  he's like you made a mistake you replied like you reacted to me like it was crazy to be in that
*  yeah to do so so tell me a jester because i want what i want i want to be able to i want to be able
*  to watch people who are going to who are going to sometimes make me feel like i was i was right
*  and they're going to be mocking someone that i that i disagree with and then i also want and then
*  two seconds later i mean this happens a little bit with dave chapelle i see like oh dave's the
*  best at it but there's a guy named andrew schultz who's thriving during this lockdown because he
*  can't do stand-up and he's doing on his instagram he does these really well produced videos where
*  he'll take down a subject like um i don't even want to give you an example but he's got a bunch
*  of them out there but he's fantastic at it he's really good at it and he's also independent and
*  he's a wild young really funny comedian and he doesn't have any affiliation whether it's he's
*  not like stuck in this left-wing paradigm or he's not a right-wing person he's not in any way shape
*  so he's just like what's this bullshit here's here's the problem with these motherfuckers and
*  then he goes on these that's him right there he's fantastic oh yeah he's got a new one
*  fake woke activism no one asked for but they're great and they're like they're all like 10 15
*  minutes long and then he fucking nails it it's really really good stuff is there anyone out there
*  who mocks the anti-woke people the anti-woke you know what i mean the people that are like all you
*  need is rationality and free thinking i'm sure yeah i'm sure there's i'm sure there's someone out
*  there there's probably some like heavy-duty left-wing people that are mocking like oh you're right yeah
*  yeah i'm sure maybe it's on me well i mean we got a problem in ideology world right we've got a
*  problem with these very strict left versus right things you know it's really weird and and i've
*  been acutely aware of it because i've been so often accused of being right-wing for the most
*  bizarre reasons mostly because of the way i look and because i'm a commentator for the ufc and you
*  know i'm a meathead i look like a meathead i'm a hunter all these different things i get accused
*  of being and then you know it turns out i'm a bernie sanders supporter and i lean way more
*  towards progressive ideas but i also support the second amendment it's like people have this idea
*  in their head that you have to be in these hard lines and if you're not you're not a part of a
*  tribe and you get ostracized by that tribe and there's a very real stigma attached to that
*  and you feel that stigma when people attack you for your ideas and so people lean into what gets
*  them love and lean away from what gets them chastised yeah well i feel like i don't have a
*  i mean one thing that i feel i feel these days is i i feel very politically homeless yes and i think
*  there's a deep because and i don't like the moderates either because i don't feel moderate
*  because there's some stuff i'm not moderate about it's like no there's some shit that's really bad
*  and we need to change it right now yeah and so the mod you know and and like you were saying
*  right i think it's just what we want labels and simplicity right and so if you have if we look at
*  things on an issue by issue case by case basis then we don't have a category to fit ourselves into
*  and that's obviously since the beginning of time right this is what religions often provide right
*  it's like well here is what i believe in i am this kind of person and that word you know i'm
*  muslim or i'm christian or i'm protestant that word describes who i am it gives me an identity
*  right but then that locks you into all kinds of stuff yes it does it does and people lean into
*  that and oftentimes people don't even have their own opinions they have a established set of
*  opinions they've adopted because they're this or they're that they're right or they're left
*  they're christian or they're atheist and you know it's i really think like as we're talking about
*  like earlier that being woke is very akin to being religious being anti-woke is akin to being
*  atheist there's a lot of people that are like rabidly atheist the same way someone is an
*  evangelical christian i mean they they have no room for religion being positive and if you say
*  there's some positive aspects of religion i think it's a moral scaffolding for people i think it
*  gives people hope it improves the quality of their life it establishes a community amongst other
*  people that also share values and there's real positive benefits to that it's exactly how i was
*  with the natural thing i went in like a like a like an atheist right i was like this is so stupid
*  these people are all stupid then i came out and i was like no no like that's no there are some good
*  things about it right that's that's exactly there's actually it's it's funny like one of the things so
*  project i was working on way back in the day was was a podcast about people who shift it's called
*  shift and we were looking at people who fundamentally who changed their minds on really
*  really important things so we did one episode on this guy scott shepard you actually had darryl
*  davis on so this is a related thing so scott shepard was this guy it's an insane story who was
*  i mean i don't want to give away too much about this but like he started very much not a racist
*  ended up in the kkk and then left the kkk and what i wanted to understand and what i think maybe
*  this is something we just need to investigate right now is what is it that causes people to break out
*  of whatever ideological label it is that they have there was another guy that we that we did
*  another episode on that was where it ended for now um about so he was like a greenpeace activist
*  like he was one of those guys who would go in tear up gmo crops right now he's pro gmo i don't care
*  about whether or not gmos are good or bad that's not the point of the episode for me for me it's
*  like how does that happen what is it that changes you how is it interview kandace owen
*  yeah yeah because keno kandace owen ran an anti-trump website and and then she became a
*  hardline right-winger right and that's and i just want to know like how does that happen what are
*  the things and it's obviously gonna be all kinds of stuff right because it's your yeah there's
*  people around you there's so many variables but it's also like what you choose to focus on like
*  what you know sometimes there's a lot of gravity in in shifting to another perspective like and
*  people start rewarding you for that and praising you for that and then the wrong people criticize
*  you for that so you feel like you're on the right track you know you get morons that that call you
*  an asshole for having a different perspective yeah and that one thing right one thing one one
*  moment of being hurt or one discovery of being a betrayal or whatever yeah yeah yeah it's um
*  we're at an adolescent stage of interpretation of ideas that's what i think we really are and
*  of communication i and i think that what we're doing with social media and the internet in
*  general is we are far more connected than ever before but in many ways far more segregated and
*  segmented and and far more rigid in our ideas and the echo chambers have never been stronger
*  it's very and i think that the next leap of technology and i've had elon on and he discussed
*  his neural link which is really fascinating stuff because it's going to require surgery
*  like people are literally going to get holes very unnatural fucking super unnatural i mean
*  his unnatural is fillings but they're going to drill holes in your head and they're going to put
*  literal wires into your brain and you're you're going to have a device attached to your skull
*  and he said it's like a let me say like a quarter sized device on your fucking head it's going to
*  bluetooth up to your phone and you're going to be able to access information and your your
*  bandwidth that you're going to be able to access information app is going to be radically increased
*  and the way he describes it it varies between it varies between the way he describes it when it
*  seems like he's trying very hard to make it palatable versus when he sees the actual
*  future potential of it which is we're not going to be the same thing anymore just like you're not
*  the same thing as like when i was a kid uh people would lie about stuff and you really there's no
*  way to check you know they could say like i won the olympic 16 times and i was the fastest man
*  ever and you'd be like whoa who the fuck are you like there's no way to check now you could go
*  what's your name and then you pull out your phone and in five seconds you know the person's full of
*  shit so we've changed radically in our ability to assess whether things are accurate or inaccurate
*  and whether someone's a liar or not i think much like that the next leaps of technology are going
*  to completely change our understanding of motivation of emotions of what what is causing
*  someone to to have a deceptive narrative that they're trying to push forth and we're going to
*  be able to see these things we're going to be able to access this information in a very different way
*  and it's going to change what we are as human beings we're going to have some sort of cyborg
*  capacity and it's going to radically elevate our ability to understand things and to communicate
*  and that's weirdly enough probably our only hope you think it'll be good i mean here we are talking
*  about ultra-processed information i mean i was stuck with this i know okay we're stuck we're
*  stuck with this ultra-processed information is here and unless we can technology our way out of
*  this i don't i don't think we're going to get better at this if someone said okay no more social
*  media the social media we have now we keep forever nothing but youtube and facebook and twitter and
*  instagram that's it forever and you know they can randomly decide you violated their terms of service
*  and ban you and there's no room for conservative thought and they'll they'll blackball people for
*  the most ridiculous ideas because most of these people that are running these organizations are
*  super woke so what what happens then well we're fucked and it's gonna it's like literally pushing
*  us towards the point of at least an ideological civil war that's where we're at right now just
*  solving it with a brain implant feels like solving the food system with bariatric surgery
*  you know what i mean it's just like it's like okay we've got this food system so what we're
*  gonna do i'm not necessarily thinking that a brain surgery is the only way to solve it but i'm scared
*  i do think that technology and more emergent technology is probably what's going to get us
*  out of this that we what what you were talking about earlier uh in the tweet that really resonated
*  with me about ultra-processed information i think we need something that's far more
*  that has far more depth to it that something that works and distributes information in a far more
*  nuanced and a far more transparent way and i think we're we're going to move in that direction
*  and we're going to move in that direction because it seems like technology is moving everything
*  towards greater and more prevalent connectivity right you can get better internet access everywhere
*  everywhere everything is instant we're live streaming and tweeting and all this different
*  stuff it's moving us towards some ultimate moment of intense connectivity and i think we're going
*  to be able to read each other's minds that's one of the things that elon said he like he said you're
*  going to be able to talk without using your mouth and i think he's right and i think that's what's
*  going to happen we're going to be able to bad though i don't know if that's necessarily the future
*  though you could be getting you saying it could be better we i think we're going to be able to read
*  thoughts and emotions you know in a way where you'll you'll know that someone's being a baby
*  you know someone's being a child you you'll know someone's being deceptive you'll be able to see
*  these things what a terrifying world that's sort of like that you know the radical honesty people
*  have you seen this group it's the people that are like you never lie about anything so it's this
*  weird social experiment where they're just like you know whether where they're with their loved
*  ones or whatever and the loved ones are like do you like my shirt and they're like no it looks
*  bad and you've gained weight right and like there's it's it's radical transparency about
*  everything and that that i understand where they're coming from right it's like this thought that
*  like we're all sort of laid bare to each other um but also like it's great that we can keep things
*  private like what we live in right now is the sort of grassroots i mean i call it a grassroots
*  panopticon right we're all watching each other but it's not the government it's not big brother
*  we're big brother right and that i want to keep stuff i like i like like i i know what you're
*  saying i don't want you to look at my brain i know what you're saying and i i agree with you
*  to a certain extent but however um i'm a stand-up comic and one of the things that i love about
*  being a stand-up comic is my friends are all brutally honest and they fuck with me and we
*  fuck with each other like i said do you like this shirt and he'd be like no dummy it looks stupid
*  on you they will say something like that we both be like ah they would say to them like do you
*  think i gained weight like you know you gain weight motherfucker get on the scale you fat fuck
*  and they'll say that to you and they start laughing we there's no in the comedy world like in the
*  world of my friends there's no room for dishonesty and if they think you're bullshitting they don't
*  want to talk to you because it's no fun i think comedians are uniquely strong in that way though
*  i i so as someone too right for me like my thing was like rationale like i liked rationale it was
*  like oh we have a good argument like i'll just have a logical argument with you right but like
*  one of the things i realized and this one you know when i was there at that place in in florida
*  where this fucking charlatan is killing people yeah i can't just tell those people the truth
*  that's crazy i wish i could but they're dying and they're in pain and there's certain people
*  who are constitutionally they like honesty all the time they thrive on it yeah even when they're in
*  pain right but there's a lot of people where logic or honesty that's just not the that's not
*  the they're gonna suffer they're gonna they're gonna suffer no i i agree i i think you're right
*  about that that there's there's certain people that you really shouldn't like you know if you're
*  talking to a delicate person and they ask you a question and it's there's nothing wrong with
*  just being complimented you look great you look great i like doing that too i have a kid i one
*  of my things my wife so my kid would come to me with drawings right you're like you know kid comes
*  with a drawing right and she'd be like dad look at this and i'd be like oh that looks like shit
*  yeah i was like hazel i was like hazel that's not your best work and my wife is like what the you
*  fucking monster what is wrong with you and i was like well i should just i don't want her to like
*  and she's like no it's a kid she just wants love from her dad right you tell her like that's a great
*  you know did a great job and i don't want to infantilize adults but like there are times when
*  i am when i just need you know love or like i need someone to keep their thoughts to themselves
*  and and yeah i don't know i i know what you mean i don't know i haven't been in a lot of pain joe
*  is the truth i haven't i've been i've led this charmed life i've led it on someone said like
*  i've led it on difficulty level like pretty easy setting you know my my personally life and like
*  i've been lucky i haven't been like super sick like who knows what kinds of crazy healing therapies
*  i would be into i mean there was a guy there's a guy at duke who specializes in als rick bedlack
*  photos of him are incredible because he dresses in wonky outfits like flashy like tuxedos and
*  crazy ties and stuff i was like rick why do you why do you dress in all these outfits and he's
*  like because it's the best because it's the best thing i can offer my patients is these is i don't
*  i can't tell them the scientific studies they're not here for that right i don't have anything to
*  offer my als patients in terms of like science or rationality but what i can do is just make them feel
*  lighthearted for a moment and i was like do you tell them like when they come into the office do
*  you tell them like the truth you know which is like basically like you're you're done for you know
*  and he's like you know obviously not right you don't just tell people who are in pain the truth
*  or at least you don't there's there's i don't know for me i've really pulled back from
*  i've really pulled back really recently from from the idea that truth telling is the way to engage
*  with people who are in pain right i think a lot of what we're seeing right now with black lives
*  matter a lot of what we see with with with transgender activism uh all of the hot button
*  political issues often right change is there's there are groups of people who have been in pain
*  for a very long time um and individuals within those groups have been in pain and
*  and that i don't know i think it's just important to sort of acknowledge that and i had a lot of
*  trouble doing that i would be like well here's the truth like here's your situation here's how
*  you need to fix it and like but that's not i don't know that's that's not necessarily it doesn't work
*  and it's not necessarily what people want yeah well in those two particular subjects too you're
*  dealing with people that are that will get very upset if you do offer anything that
*  anything that contradicts their narrative well and if you know if someone's in if someone's in pain
*  or if someone's like literally trying i mean if they're if you're trying to change a situation
*  for the better yeah right there's you can always throw nuance in you can always have a logical
*  argument about something but i've become and i'm not saying like don't say stuff i'm i'm very on
*  board with like you want freedom right like i want to be able to say chiropractor is a bullshit
*  i want to do that but like if there's someone who was struggling with chronic back pain forever
*  and found a chiropractor and they come back from that chiropractor and they say to me alan for the
*  first time in my life i feel like there's some hope this chiropractor helped me if i have that
*  thing in my brain i don't say it yeah i'm with you i'm with you i'd be like that's great i'd be
*  like that's great but alan that's just being kind yeah so you value kindness and i think that's an
*  awesome thing to value and i value that as well and i think that's something that i've learned
*  as i've gotten older is that you don't always have to say what you think you could just be nice and
*  i've seen i've saw i saw you do this like i love this moment i don't know i forget which podcast
*  it was on you were like you were talking about something and then you were like you look down
*  and you were like wait i think i think we're making fun of this person is what you said
*  and i feel like and that was a moment right it was like you want to like yeah you want to be kind
*  right and and honesty that's the difficult the sometimes ridiculous things or illogical things
*  are the kind thing and i'm really struggling now and i hope i just wish everyone were struggling
*  to realize that that those are those are sometimes incommensurable values you can't
*  sometimes be honest or tell the truth and also be kind at the same time right there's this book uh
*  god what is it about a kid who's um i can't believe i'm blanking on the book now but it's
*  a kid who's severely disfigured um and it was a book for young adults and and there's this moment
*  in that book where one of the the teacher puts on the board when you're given the choice between
*  being right and being kind always choose being kind yeah and i was like when i first read that
*  i was like that's so stupid man you can be the way to be kind is by helping someone be right and
*  like tell them the truth right but i used to share that thought but i'm now in the group of be kind
*  yeah and as i've gotten older first of all i never sat i never i never i never went out
*  with the idea that i would create something that millions of people would see never this was not
*  this is just something that happened along the way and as it was happening i became more and more
*  aware of the impact and then the responsibility that comes with that impact and just through that
*  process has made me a far nicer person because i'm mostly i'm really aware of you know mean shit
*  like i never i don't i don't attack people i don't like it i don't i'd rather just not you know and
*  i don't i don't even want like if someone says to me before the podcast and they have before hey
*  would you do me a favor and not talk about this weird thing that happened to me i'm like i don't
*  want to make you uncomfortable i don't we could talk about a million things you're a human being
*  i'm a human being there's not like a specific i don't want i want gotcha moments if you want to
*  talk about something that's in your heart that you want to get out i'll talk to you about it but i'm
*  not i'm not a mean person you know and when i was younger i was and when i was younger i was i was
*  in the group of fuck that tell them the truth they need to face reality get your fucking shit
*  together and then and as i've gotten older i've realized like there's not that's that's me worried
*  about myself falling short that's me worry about worrying about my own failures and then wanting
*  to sort of reinforce my own philosophies and other people because i was insecure well this i mean it's
*  interesting you're saying right like talking to millions of people and this goes back to the stuff
*  you were saying about written language and the the fact that you can't respond to stuff the
*  difference between a conversation is you know such and such so so here we are we can talk to each
*  other i can have an argument with you about you know whether like turmeric coffee works or whatever
*  it happens to be right or supplements or whatever it is we can talk about chiropractic right but
*  there's someone else out there who really did just go to a chiropractor and so it puts you
*  especially not me right i'm not i don't have like a podcast reaching millions of people
*  you got a twitter dude they're coming at you too don't worry about it i'm sure they are but you know
*  yeah twitter i think i mean twitter i see as a spiritual exercise i've said this before i go on
*  twitter to force myself to be kind like how can i balance how can i be on twitter and communicate
*  with people like q anon right instead of just mocking q anon like can i engage with a q anon
*  person like you know but anyway that i do what do they say back they really want to talk to you about
*  q anon and then i ask them questions about it and i try to have you had like meaningful dialogue
*  you know i i have had meaningful dialogue i've even had meaningful dialogue on twitter with
*  people who were i mean honestly my my my favorite moments on twitter are where i engage with someone
*  and it starts angry and then i'm like okay alan can we get this to a place where we're being
*  kind to each other if i can do it on twitter i mean that's like that's like the gymnasium of
*  the soul right if you can be kind to someone on twitter but i was saying like you're in a you're
*  in a shitty situation in part because when it comes to this kind of thing because you're
*  communicating to 5 000 different types of audiences all at the same time you're talking with me you're
*  talking with the people who are watching this right now all of whom are range from people who
*  are not in pain to people who are in pain yeah some of those people need honesty to help with
*  their pain and so you know what i mean it's like and i don't even know how you handle and then and
*  then you don't want to be lying you want to be telling the truth you have to evolve as a human
*  and get better at your own your own bullshit and your own like what are you trying to get out what
*  is your message like what are you saying like what is in your head and are you using words to
*  accurately relay what's in your head or have you fucked that up you get better at that but
*  there's some benefit no doubt to engaging with people online i mean i guess i just it's just
*  untenable for me there's too many people but you know megan phelps is yes yeah it was a great
*  example yeah yeah she's an amazing person i've had her on the show too megan phelps is the
*  granddaughter of fred phelps who is the leader of the westboro baptist church one of the most vicious
*  nastiest evil religious groups ever that would have these god hates fags signs and hold it up
*  in front of the when soldiers would die they would go to their funerals the craziest shit and
*  she grew up in this horrible environment and then through twitter interacting with her husband on
*  twitter that fucking dude that angel whoever he is that dude converted her and he just talked to
*  her back and forth and they became friends and then eventually they became married and then they
*  have a child together and they're happy it's a cliche i mean you said it's interesting when
*  you said that's being kind right i mean there are these cliches and i hate how we also live
*  in this like ultra ironic time now where like every you know oh it's a cliche it was like no
*  kindness and love you know and it sounds it's valuable they work it sounds corny but it's
*  valuable it's what every saint and sage they've said it since the beginning of time and you can
*  be like oh that's a cliche or it's more complicated than that and it is it is more complicated always
*  right but like i don't know the the the the kindness i don't know it's hard too because i
*  don't want to even be i keep thinking right it's like you get in this like inception of of nuance
*  right but like you and i can say hey we need to be kind or i you know i need to be kind i can speak
*  for myself but like there are some people who actually they're gonna say back no i'm being
*  fucking hurt right like the time like for me i need to fight back i need to not be kind if you're in
*  an abusive relationship right or whatever like or if you're in a in a position where you're fighting
*  for something you believe in so i don't even want to be telling other people they are all i
*  feel comfortable with right now and this is sort of where i landed after you know i mean people
*  were pushing me like this subtitle on this book man that was pushed on me i'm gonna be honest how
*  faith in nature's goodness leads to harmful fads unjust laws and flawed science it makes it sound
*  like it's a fucking takedown you know they were like we need you you know this is this is how a
*  subtitle needs to work it needs to tell people like this simple truth where there's like just as
*  a marketing ploy that was just their idea the british the british book has a different subtitle
*  just the seductive myth of natural goodness oh that's better i mean i understand where they
*  were coming from though right because my publishers like look they want to sell a lot of books yeah
*  and people want this they don't like you know people don't want kindness kindness doesn't sell
*  right like controversy sells and so i it's hard you know again you know i think about this a lot
*  because you know i want people to read my book i want people to listen to me i would love to have
*  you know i'd love to be able to talk about you know my you know i'm going to be talking about
*  quantification in my next book right so i i want people to hear what i have to say about
*  how quantification gets abused but i'm also like well the best way to get people to hear me
*  right might be to like ratchet up the controversy or the thing so you know you don't think so i
*  don't think so i think the i really think like what you're talking about like don't tell people
*  what to do you like i want to be kind but i don't feel like i should be telling people
*  but here's the thing man you don't have to you don't have to tell people just lead by example
*  just do what you're doing and do it at your best and if you can be kind that will have a greater
*  impact than anything i mean it's like being a parent right you can tell your kids what to do
*  but one of the best things that i've found is to just live life in a way that your kids see the
*  right way to do things in the wrong way to do things and one of the things i always do whenever
*  whenever i correct my kids i always say hey let me tell you something i did way worse than that
*  i'm way dumber than you and this problem that you you created or this thing that you did wrong i've
*  done way worse i've definitely done that i'll tell you the things i've done i always tell my kids all
*  the things i screwed up on i love telling them that i love telling them like let me tell you
*  what i used to lie about and i'll tell that my kids like lies that i used to tell i'll tell
*  my kids all the screw-ups that i used to and i i tell them that just so that they know first
*  i'm not picking on them like i'm a grown man with i pay taxes they're you know i'm talking
*  to a 10 year old there's no way this is fair so i always criticize myself first and whenever they
*  do something wrong i always say listen for before you know just so you know rather i
*  fucked this up already too but you're in i don't know man you're in a i guess like what i would
*  say is it does it does work for you like for example to take one thing that i've talked about
*  something you do on your show that i encourage my students to do is i say look if you don't know
*  something say i don't know yeah say i don't know if i've used a word in class or if you don't know
*  the answer say you don't know right and and that and you doing that makes people feel comfortable
*  with admitting they don't know things it's a kind thing to do for a person especially person
*  position of power to say i don't know but the problem is there's also a lot of authority and
*  cultural currency in pretending to know shit and there are far more people out there there are far
*  more people out there who have risen to positions of power pretending they know everything than
*  admitting that they don't know things it's so dumb there's zero benefit zero benefit in pretending
*  you have information that you don't have zero there's zero benefit because first of all it
*  you'll get exposed people will find out they'll they'll and then also it doesn't make you look
*  any better if you pretend you know something like there's actual strength in saying what does that
*  mean i don't know that oh okay or or oh i thought it was the other way oh my god i'm an idiot i
*  totally power in that i totally disagree there's power in admitting you don't know but i think
*  there's a lot of benefit in pretending you know stuff that you don't for one ultimately ultimately
*  know because you get exposed and then they'll never listen to you again people will never trust
*  you it's very valuable to tell the truth very valuable didn't you just tell me about a guy
*  with a nice house and a car who was doing placebo fucking magic yeah i mean he had an okay house i
*  don't want to live in that shithole i'm just saying you know what i'm saying like there's a lot of
*  liars out there know that guy's full of shit now and i think his businesses eroded radically
*  you know it got through the community that he's full of shit i mean but yeah i know what you're
*  saying like he was he was scamming people but he knows he's scamming people that that that the what
*  you carry in your heart being a con artist and robbing people out of their hard work hard-earned
*  dollars by tricking them and thinking that you're healing them that in in itself is a great punishment
*  when you say ultimately you mean sort of like ultimately in like the big game well not just
*  yeah in the big game but just in day-to-day life you know you're a fucking con artist like the way
*  you're paying for your food is through lies god i hope you're right i just i've seen i've met these
*  people that guy in florida these people i mean fucking come on dr os jesus christ you think dr
*  os i mean i don't know man i i this is why i mean it's interesting talking to you about it but like
*  you think he's going home at night and like jeez i really shouldn't have had that reiki
*  healer on like it's eaten me up inside does he have reiki healers on he's got how many every
*  time i go to the supermarket there's his smiling fucking face on some magazine with dr os's easy
*  way to lose weight with these you know what i mean and like it's fucking hard to be oprah she lets a
*  lot of these motherfuckers through the net oh there's a something uh on wander which is one of my
*  favorite podcasts uh i don't know if you ever listened to wander it's amazing it's they they're
*  really good and they had a fantastic one on erin hernandez who's that football player one of being
*  a murderer but they have one now on some uh con artist who's uh some some healer person who oprah
*  had on and oprah elevated this guy and now and i saw it on my feed today i was very excited to
*  read it after to listen to it rather after this podcast after we're done with our podcast but it
*  was uh essentially another one of those things where some person who oprah had on snuck through
*  the net and became a bullshit artist she's had a bunch of those on remember there's that one guy
*  wrote a book it turned out he yeah yeah yeah made up everything that was in the book and dr os is
*  he they brought him before congress because he was he had some miracle cure that literally like
*  melts fat off your body and they're like is this a miracle cure he's like no it's not like what the
*  fuck how the fuck are you still on tv well because once you do it you know what he is you know he's
*  he's a religious figure right he is he's oprah's hoe oprah's out there no no no no no my hoe's out
*  there working i'm gonna keep him out there making that money well this maybe it's and this is the
*  flip side of kindness though right i mean we keep going to this inception circle right but like
*  there's this carl sagan i think it's carl sagan line where he says you want to be open-minded but
*  not so open-minded your brain falls out right and it's like you also want to be kind but not so kind
*  that you become a kind of laundering factory for people like dr us right right um and that
*  you know and that's i don't know oprah just wants people to be happy right you know so so she's i've
*  encountered a few of those people too man over the years of doing this podcast is a few people
*  that i've had on that turned out to be full of shit it's hard because you you particularly in
*  the beginning i really didn't vet them at all like someone would tell me oh this guy's great
*  just talk to him let her talk to him then in the conversation like hey is what you're saying true
*  and then i you know it just took a while for me to understand you got something there
*  it was on the secret oh one of those motherfuckers one of the narrators the secret those motherfuckers
*  that's the ultimate of horseshit bullshit i mean what they don't want you to know you talk to
*  actual physicists about that and they just go people actually study quantum mechanics and you
*  know like the really complicated underlying mechanism of the fucking universe itself and then
*  you see these quacks out there selling horseshit and then when you find out that the secret was
*  actually well not the secret that's what the bleep what the bleep was actually run by that person who
*  claimed to be channeling some fucking thousand-year-old alien or some shit you know that lady you know
*  that do you know that i don't remember what the bleep what was it i like want to write it down
*  is this really there's yeah yeah yeah it's like there's a name to she my god she goes on and talks
*  she's like this uh middle-aged woman who's kind of heavy and she's uh talking in this weird what
*  she has this crazy word name like what is this lady's name like what kind of name is that and
*  it turns out that's not her name that is who she's channeling and they don't tell you this on the uh
*  when you're watching what the bleep but she's channeling some fucking thousand-year-old entity
*  but here i am look look now i'm just like i just need you to like make me feel hopefully i feel
*  like this is what i like came here to talk to you about or something like i just you really think in
*  the end like it comes back to bite you in the ass that feels like a very sort of redemptive vision
*  but it's like here we have a laundry list i mean we could go on and on and on and on and on about
*  charlatans who have risen to the very highest levels there's a power yeah and i feel like i'd
*  like to believe that every day they like cry into their pillows at night and they're like soul husks
*  are going to be you know shown what they truly are but i would rather concentrate on good people
*  yeah concentrate on the bad people that that succeed financially i'd rather concentrate on
*  good people because i think there's plenty of them there's plenty of really interesting
*  fascinating people that have a great message you're saying it works too you don't have you're saying
*  you can be kind and that'll work yeah yeah yeah a lot of them out there man there's a lot of like
*  really motivating fascinating people that are there they they've lived a life of of value and
*  they can relay that information to you and there's there's like real lessons that you can take out of
*  that that can enhance your own life i i think those people are real they're they're out there
*  you can concentrate on the bullshit artists that asshole down in florida selling people wheatgrass
*  but you don't have to though i mean i i hate that they're real i hate that they exist
*  but in some ways what they do is like they they make it so that you really appreciate
*  kind people and you really appreciate real people you know the the assholes and the
*  deceptive people that you run into in this life they're just going to make you appreciate the
*  exceptional people
*  god i mean i have rainy days bro yeah yeah rainy days make you appreciate the sun you do
*  you have a shot of the light crazy dr os makes you appreciate real doctors makes you appreciate
*  real real real doctors real physicians real real real people who are actually trying to help people
*  it's just crazy like and maybe he's trying to help people he is that's the thing like there was a so
*  we were in i was in div school so i went to i went to like so in divinity school although it sounds
*  like i'm gonna be a priest but like i was like it's a secular it was the university of chicago
*  so it's a secular university we were early early students in div school and we were mocking this
*  guy joel austin i don't know if you know yeah sure we're like that's the guy with the gigantic
*  arena yes he fills up yes his own jet in a mansion oh my god you know this guy right and we're just
*  like oh joel austin like can't believe that that like people think that's christianity you know
*  we're going off right and and one of my friends sitting there and usually he'd be talking he was
*  quiet the whole time he says he finally speaks up he says you know what i get what you all are
*  saying i get what you all are saying about joel austin but when i was in high school my parents
*  neglected me like he was he had like a terrible terrible childhood they didn't care about his
*  education he was dirt poor and he was like i watched joel austin and joel austin told me
*  that god wanted me to make more of myself and it and it helped me and we're all sitting there
*  looking at each other and we and i didn't even know my brain exploded right because here's this
*  guy who's just obviously a charlatan like a like for me a terrible person and here's my friend
*  being like hey you're you're laying into a guy who you know and he realizes right in retrospect
*  what was going on but he was also like you know he gave me something important and and and i i
*  didn't even i didn't even know what i didn't know what to do with that it's happened with diet gurus
*  i've laid into this guy david pearlmuter who wrote this book grain brain and stuff like that
*  like i went back through his history and i found out that he used to promise everything was a
*  miracle cure he started with this his self-published book called like i don't know like brain saving
*  dot com or something and back then he had a totally different line on it he was like you need to eat
*  only lean meat and i've cured all these people of als and then it became you need to eat saturated
*  fat and i've cured these people of als and i wrote this hit piece on him i was like this guy is a
*  horrible human being and i'm going to show you who he is i'm going to trace his charlatanry all the
*  way back to the beginning and there were all these people that were like i read david pearlmutter's
*  books and they got me eating healthy again because he does advocate you know like an alternative to
*  junk food that's so he his charisma right these people have charisma and that charisma can give
*  people hope and meaning even if it's like fake energy healing people are so weird we're so
*  complicated we are so we're so we're so complicated natural we're unnatural animals right yeah
*  natural listen man we've been talking for three and a half hours what yeah it's 330 can you believe
*  it i can't believe it really there's a fucking time warp in this room man it's very strange
*  we happen all the time yeah humans are weird i really i mean i don't know i think that i don't
*  know i think that last i think that's maybe what i really care about is just just there's so much
*  right there's so much to pay attention to there's so many people who's just in this country alone
*  there's 320 million people yeah and a lot of them are talking publicly you know there's a lot there's
*  a lot out there but there's a lot of good out there too the the key is to just concentrate on
*  the good you know and and just be the best that you could be that's the key just be the nicest you
*  could be be the kindness you could be be the most honest you could be and you're gonna fuck up there's
*  no way around it you're just you're a person and if you fuck up you can't be too hard on yourself
*  you can't judge yourself on failures you gotta you gotta recognize that you are the person who's
*  learned from those failures you're you're you're you're not defined by mistakes you know and that's
*  a lot of the lot of what people do they get they define themselves by mistakes and then they also
*  judge other people by their mistakes and they decide that this one moment in time that this
*  person said the wrong thing or did the wrong thing or made a mistake or was incorrect about something
*  that defines them forever you know and all these people that you could find good things in whether
*  there's Joel Olsteen or Dr Oz or what are these people like it just there's just there's a lesson
*  in data that comes from them about just how weirdly complicated human beings are and how wildly we
*  we vary that's it that's that that's i just it's funny because you know i think we're we're
*  comfortable with that but a lot of times people aren't comfortable with complexity no they like
*  to define people yeah they want to make things very binary they want to make people good or bad
*  right or left one or zero right and that's not the world's messy it's like it's a human problem
*  it's like we were talking about with abortion or there's a lot of human problems that's a human
*  problem and i think it's hard to be comfortable with yourself so it's very hard to be comfortable
*  with other people that's why i always stress with people like you've got to accept yourself for what
*  you've done wrong do your best and also find some difficult shit to do because that gets away a lot
*  of the anxiety that you carry around in your body a lot of like difficult things make regular life
*  less difficult and that sounds so simplistic but particularly physically difficult things
*  because when you do things that are physically difficult the strain of making yourself do those
*  things it's very valuable it's not just valuable like exercise and fitness and martial arts and
*  running and whatever you're doing that's really difficult it's not just valuable in terms of like
*  health and the way you look but it's also valuable for your mind maybe even more so because regular
*  life can be confusing and little things that go wrong and little problems that arise are exacerbated
*  by the fact that you're not accustomed to dealing with hardship so creating your own bullshit whether
*  it's through some brutal kettlebell exercise or running up hills or something is extremely
*  valuable for you also not not just accepting the nuanced perspectives of other people but also
*  being able to navigate through this world with some sort of an understanding of just how complex
*  it all is and how weird it all is and and and not be overly thrown off by every little dip in the
*  road and pothole that you encounter focus on the good focus on the good focus on the good people
*  and hope that and have faith i guess that that that'll work know that there are bad people
*  but you know just do your best do your best and you know and don't get suckered there's a lot of
*  suckers and tell the truth even if you feel like it's going to sell yeah books to live yes yes
*  or you know not if it's an old lady and you look great say that say that to her i don't know be
*  nice right choose kindness over truth if you have to um tell you your book one more time natural
*  hold it up so people can see it where do i where am i holding it towards this camera yeah it's a
*  natural how faith in nature's goodness leads to harmful fads unjust laws and flawed science but
*  you know now that that's just a publicity ploy it's really very nuanced fuckers with their titles
*  and um your your instagram or your twitter i have twitter at alan levinowitz and also there's i mean
*  we got an episode of the shift podcast up on on apple itunes and if you search like shift alan on
*  spotify there's we've got like the first episode up there beautiful which would be cool all right
