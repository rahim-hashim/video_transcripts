# Joe Rogan Experience #1908 - Erika Thompson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA)
*  This is your first podcast? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=0.0s)]
*  This is my first podcast. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=14.44s)]
*  Well thank you very much for allowing me to be the host of you for the first podcast. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=16.16s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me in The B's. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=21.28s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=23.32s)]
*  I became fascinated with B's when we did an episode of Fear Factor where we had a cover [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=24.32s)]
*  of these people in B's and it was this outdoor thing that we did at this ranch and while [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=29.1s)]
*  we were doing it a local hive of bees came over and interacted with our bees and we had [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=35.06s)]
*  to shut down production. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=43.34s)]
*  And so I talked to the beekeeper I said what's going on and he said we have to shut everything [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=45.14s)]
*  down for an hour or so while they work this out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=48.8s)]
*  While the bees work it out. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=53.1s)]
*  Yeah I'm like what do you mean? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=54.1s)]
*  He's like well they're going to communicate because these bees are trying to figure out [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=55.660000000000004s)]
*  why these bees are here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=58.4s)]
*  Why our bees are there. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=60.24s)]
*  And I go they're going to communicate? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=62.4s)]
*  Like is it going to be a bee war? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=63.4s)]
*  He's like no they're going to sort it out. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=65.12s)]
*  I'm like how do they sort it out? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=66.52s)]
*  And it's kind of unknown right? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=69.12s)]
*  Like how? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=70.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=71.56s)]
*  Well what happened with those bees? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=72.56s)]
*  They sorted it out. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  The other bees went away and our bees came back and stayed and then we resumed the show. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=75.68s)]
*  That's great. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=81.88s)]
*  So what kind of communication are bees capable of? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=82.88s)]
*  Do we know? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=86.12s)]
*  We don't know everything there is to know about bees. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=87.58s)]
*  Bees have been around for 120 million years. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=90.58s)]
*  We've been keeping bees for maybe 10,000. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=93.94s)]
*  You know if I were to think I knew more than the bees that would be so foolish of me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=96.86s)]
*  But we do know some of the ways that bees communicate. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=102.86s)]
*  They communicate through scents, through pheromones a lot, through these chemical signals that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  they're sending out to the entire colony to let this colony that's a super organism know [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=111.46s)]
*  what's going on. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=116.34s)]
*  And so in your case you had one colony of bees. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=118.02s)]
*  A colony is a collective noun, is the collective noun for a group of bees whereas a hive is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=121.62s)]
*  the box they live in. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=127.24s)]
*  So you had these two colonies who met and were trying to make sure they all stayed together [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=128.9s)]
*  and they all stayed with their queen and went to the right place. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  And it sounds like you had a bunch of bees in one area and bees are social creatures [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=137.54s)]
*  So they were attracted to the scents of these other bees and were there to see what's going on. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  And you know they eventually figured it out and everybody went back to their respective places. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=147.3s)]
*  And it was fine. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=152.66000000000003s)]
*  So what is happening though when they're figuring it out? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  They're smelling that the is it that these other bees have a specifically different pheromone? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=157.3s)]
*  Yes they will have a different scent and that's how they'll stay with their colony. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=162.06s)]
*  And it comes from the queen. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=165.62s)]
*  The queen has a queen mandibular pheromone. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=166.9s)]
*  And so she is sending out scent signals, pheromones to the colony and they're always communicating [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=169.22s)]
*  with each other. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=175.42s)]
*  And the queen and the worker bees have this wonderful system of checks and balances to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=176.42s)]
*  make sure that everything gets done within the hive and that the colony is doing what it needs to. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=181.78s)]
*  Is it possible that bees who are like loner bees could integrate with another hive? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=193.5s)]
*  You know it happens to me in my work all the time. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=194.5s)]
*  I remove bees from places and you know I'll go in and take a colony and a hive out and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  relocate it to my apiary. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=203.61999999999998s)]
*  And in that process I don't always get every bee of course. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=206.06s)]
*  And the bees that are left behind or if there's a loner bee they can join another colony. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  And it's actually their chances of successfully joining are increased if they bring gifts [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=216.45999999999998s)]
*  of pollen or honey. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=221.54s)]
*  So whoa. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=223.22s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=224.22s)]
*  But you know bees live a very short lifespan so sometimes they'll just live out the rest [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=226.02s)]
*  of their bee life. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=232.14s)]
*  And the bees that we see out in the world foraging they're at the end of their short [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=233.14s)]
*  bee life. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=238.74s)]
*  How long is a bee's life? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=239.74s)]
*  So a worker bee and we're talking about honey bees, western honey bees, the ones you see [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=240.82s)]
*  me keep. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=245.02s)]
*  The lifespan of a female worker bee varies throughout the year. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=247.54s)]
*  So in the spring and summer when the bees are working their hardest the female worker [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=252.29999999999998s)]
*  bees will only live about six weeks. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=256.62s)]
*  In the winter when they're not doing quite as much and when we need more bees to make [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=259.62s)]
*  it through the winter they'll live a little bit longer and they'll live about six months [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=264.74s)]
*  and their bodies actually change in the winter. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=268.46s)]
*  The bees that are born later in the year and need to make it through the winter will have [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=272.3s)]
*  more fat bodies on them so that they can make it through the dearth when there's nothing [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=276.3s)]
*  in bloom and when bees are living off the honey that they collected or stored in their [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=281.78s)]
*  hive earlier in the year. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=285.9s)]
*  And how long does the queen live? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=287.68s)]
*  The queen can live the longest. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=289.12s)]
*  She can live about five years. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=290.76s)]
*  That's on the longer end. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=293.28s)]
*  Most queens will live a little bit shorter but she can live significantly longer than [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  all the other bees in the hive. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=299.94s)]
*  And then we have the worker bees who live about six weeks, six months. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=301.96s)]
*  The queen bee can live up to five years and the drone bees will live about six months. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=307.65999999999997s)]
*  And what is the ratio of male bees to female bees? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=311.6s)]
*  A honey bee colony is about 95% female and the amount of male bees can actually fluctuate [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=317.46s)]
*  throughout the year. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=324.5s)]
*  So when we need male bees around to mate with a queen, and they'll mate with a queen, not [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=326.26s)]
*  their queen, but when we need more male bees around the colony will produce more male bees. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=331.1s)]
*  In the winter, when there aren't as many resources available to the bees, the female bees will [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=338.18s)]
*  kick all the male bees out of the hive and they'll either starve or freeze to death. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=344.3s)]
*  So right now there are no male bees in most hives. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=349.1s)]
*  In these bees that came along with me today, there's not a single male honey bee there. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=354.22s)]
*  They starve to death. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=359.38s)]
*  They starve to death. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=360.38s)]
*  They have no way of foraging. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=361.38s)]
*  They don't do the work of bees. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=362.38s)]
*  Most people have never seen a male honey bee before and that's just because male honey [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=364.86s)]
*  bees are out in the world doing the work of bees. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=370.36s)]
*  They stay in the hive or they leave and they go to drone congregation areas to mate with [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=373.86s)]
*  a queen, but they're not going to be on a flower or in your wine glass or whatnot. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  So the male bees don't mate with their own females. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=383.6s)]
*  Would that be like mating with the mother? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=387.44s)]
*  That would be like incestuous. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=389.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  So here's what happens within the colony when it's time for the queen bee to mate. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  So once a queen bee is born, when she reaches the ripe age of about seven days old, she'll [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=397.08s)]
*  go on a mating flight and she may go on only one, possibly two mating flights in her entire [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  life and she'll fly out of the hive and she'll go to a drone congregation area, which is [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=408.11999999999995s)]
*  exactly what it sounds like. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=414.65999999999997s)]
*  It's an area where there's a bunch of drone male honey bees flying around just waiting [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=416.08s)]
*  for a queen bee to fly by. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=421.78s)]
*  And these drone congregation areas exist about a hundred feet in the sky, which is another [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  reason you would never see a male honey bee. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=428.82s)]
*  But if a queen bee flies by, the fastest, strongest drones win and they will successfully [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=431.96s)]
*  mate with a queen and the queen will mate with only about 15 to 20 drone bees and she'll [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=439.24s)]
*  have enough sperm to last the rest of her life. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=444.56s)]
*  And what happens to the male bees is once they mate with a queen, their endophallus [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=448.16s)]
*  rips out of their abdominal cavity and they fall to the ground and that's the end of their [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=452.52s)]
*  little bee life. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=457.36s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=458.36s)]
*  So they die during mating. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=459.36s)]
*  They die during mating. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=460.42s)]
*  Harsh life for a male bee. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=462.6s)]
*  Depending how you look at it, I guess. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=464.32s)]
*  Starved to death, die when you have sex. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=466.16s)]
*  I mean, but also, you know, his genes pass on and he's a successful male honey bee. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=467.96s)]
*  But they also don't have to do a lot of work in the hive. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=475.28s)]
*  They don't forage for food. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=478.4s)]
*  They don't build the hive. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  They don't have wax glands. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=481.64s)]
*  They don't even have stingers. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=482.82s)]
*  They don't defend the hive. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=483.94s)]
*  So they have one role. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=485.76s)]
*  So how does the males know? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  Is there a specific time of the year where the males know that the female queen is going [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=491.65999999999997s)]
*  to be flying around? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=495.96s)]
*  Sure, in the spring and in the summer. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=496.96s)]
*  And that's when, you know, that's their only job. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=498.44s)]
*  So if they're present, that's what they're trying to do. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=500.64s)]
*  And that's why the colony controls how many drones there are. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=502.91999999999996s)]
*  So right now in the hive, there aren't that many drone bees because they're trying to [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=506.76s)]
*  conserve the resources they have. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=512.16s)]
*  So the honey that we eat from bees is their food source in the winter when nothing is [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=514.36s)]
*  in bloom and there's no flowers out there for them to forage from. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=520.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  So what are the male bees when they're inside the hive? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=526.2s)]
*  What's their specific job? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=532.0400000000001s)]
*  What kind of work are they doing when they're in there? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=534.32s)]
*  They're really not doing a lot of work. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=536.2s)]
*  Just hanging out eating? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=537.76s)]
*  Some research will show that they're contributing to the heating of the hive, but they're really [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  not doing a lot of work. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  Even when you see them in the colony, not only can you distinguish them because they [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=545.72s)]
*  look different from the female worker bees. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  They're larger than the female worker bees, but they're not doing anything. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=553.92s)]
*  They're walking around different. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=558.1999999999999s)]
*  They're kind of fumbling and bumbling around. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=559.92s)]
*  So they really don't have a lot of purpose, which is why there aren't that many of them. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=562.78s)]
*  We have to keep in mind they only make up about 5% of the population, maybe 10, sometimes [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=568.52s)]
*  zero. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=573.5999999999999s)]
*  So there aren't that many male honeybees. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=574.5999999999999s)]
*  And I always love sharing with people that they probably have never seen one. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=576.64s)]
*  If you're ever near an observation hive or have the opportunity to go into a hive with [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=580.78s)]
*  a beekeeper, I encourage folks to do that and make sure you ask to see a male honeybee. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=584.3000000000001s)]
*  So they fly up in the air and they put a pheromone out that lets the queen know that they're [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=590.12s)]
*  there? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=596.66s)]
*  Yes, the drones will emit a pheromone. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=597.66s)]
*  These drone congregation areas still remain somewhat of a mystery. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=602.5s)]
*  They seem to be a place that the drones will go back to annually, but we don't really know [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=606.7s)]
*  why or how they select these areas. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=612.34s)]
*  There's some research that shows they're covered by wind. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=614.7800000000001s)]
*  They're going to be a safe area for the bees to fly around. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=618.3000000000001s)]
*  And they're massive. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=623.34s)]
*  They can be 100 feet in the sky, but they can be about 500 feet wide. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=624.44s)]
*  I mean, a ton of male honeybees flying around, just doing circles, waiting for a queen to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=627.9000000000001s)]
*  fly by. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=633.98s)]
*  And how does the queen detect where they are in terms of pheromones? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=635.2s)]
*  I think it's just the chemical pheromones. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=639.5200000000001s)]
*  They're not flying that far from their hive area, so it's within a radius. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=643.0400000000001s)]
*  Bees to forage will only fly about two miles. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=648.6s)]
*  But they go every day. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=652.6400000000001s)]
*  This is the males. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=654.32s)]
*  The drones fly out of the hive and try to mate successfully every day. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=655.5200000000001s)]
*  So they're always doing this. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=660.82s)]
*  And most drones will never meet with a queen. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  It's a small percentage of drones that mate with a queen because she only mates with maybe [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=665.04s)]
*  15 to 20 drones. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=670.04s)]
*  So do bees have a nose like we think of a nose? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=671.92s)]
*  Their world very much exists through scents, but they don't really have a nose like we [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=677.8399999999999s)]
*  do. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=683.5999999999999s)]
*  They can taste through their feet. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=684.5999999999999s)]
*  They even have a way to taste the difference between sweet and salty through their feet. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=686.9599999999999s)]
*  And I believe it's just glands that they're doing this through. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=691.68s)]
*  They have antennae too, which their antennae help them move within the colony and talk [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=695.1600000000001s)]
*  to each other and clean themselves. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=701.6400000000001s)]
*  But yeah, they're remarkable little creatures. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=705.2s)]
*  It's so fascinating how they have this uniform structure, the hive, with all these little [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=708.6800000000001s)]
*  catacombs and all these little combs that they create. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=714.24s)]
*  And they all do it the same way. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=718.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=719.9200000000001s)]
*  Like, how do they know how to do it? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=720.9200000000001s)]
*  Do we have an understanding of how they teach each other? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=723.0s)]
*  Or is it innate in their genetics? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=726.04s)]
*  Well, the comb building is a really interesting process because we see it as hexagonal comb, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=728.24s)]
*  right? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=736.72s)]
*  We see little hexagons within the hive, but they actually start off building it as circles. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=737.72s)]
*  So the weight of the hive will bring it down. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=743.0s)]
*  And the way that they build the comb is actually up at an angle so that the honey doesn't seep [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=747.2s)]
*  out. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=752.48s)]
*  It's remarkable what they have figured out how to do as a species, how to engineer this [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=753.48s)]
*  perfect building and do it out of beeswax, out of something that their body produces [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=759.36s)]
*  naturally. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=765.16s)]
*  I mean, I can think of no better example that nature has given us for a sustainable creature [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=766.16s)]
*  that can build its home out of something that comes off of its body and just live with what's [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=770.72s)]
*  around them and then always leave the world better than they found it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=778.04s)]
*  It is very fascinating. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=782.8399999999999s)]
*  But do we have any sort of studies on what is the process that's going on within them [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=785.0s)]
*  that allows them to know when it's time to create these combs? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it's when it's time to create the combs. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=797.4s)]
*  I mean, they start creating a comb as soon as they find a cavity to build in. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=800.0s)]
*  Most of the comb building takes place within the first 40 days. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=805.3199999999999s)]
*  The bees will build the majority of their hives. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=808.68s)]
*  So, I don't know for sure, but I would say it's just a natural instinct. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=812.08s)]
*  When they find a place to live, they need safety and they need a place to bring up their [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=816.92s)]
*  young. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=823.96s)]
*  The queen lays eggs in the comb. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=824.96s)]
*  It's not just storing honey and food. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=826.44s)]
*  This is where the bees also raise their young. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=829.76s)]
*  And I think it's just they know that they need a safe place to live. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=832.4s)]
*  And so they start to build a beehive immediately. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=836.8s)]
*  The queen is a solitary queen in the hive, in the colony. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=840.8000000000001s)]
*  So what happens when females are born? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=846.9200000000001s)]
*  So the female bees are the worker bees and they're the ones that make up about 95% of [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=849.9200000000001s)]
*  the population. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=854.9200000000001s)]
*  And they cannot lay eggs that have been fertilized. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=855.9200000000001s)]
*  So they can lay eggs that only result in drone male bees. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=860.24s)]
*  So there's no competition between the queen and the worker bees. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=865.0s)]
*  I mean, there's, you know, the queen has one job. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=869.12s)]
*  That's to lay eggs for the colony. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=872.64s)]
*  She is essentially the female reproductive organ of this greater being that is the super [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=874.32s)]
*  organism of a bee colony. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=882.24s)]
*  So when the worker bees are born, they're the ones doing all the work for the hive, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=884.08s)]
*  those other female bees besides the queen bee. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=888.5600000000001s)]
*  So does the queen, when the worker bees are born, and you said they lay eggs and they [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=892.12s)]
*  can only make males? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=898.16s)]
*  They don't lay eggs. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=899.76s)]
*  They don't lay eggs. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=900.76s)]
*  So they can. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=901.76s)]
*  And on occasion they will if a colony is queen-less. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=903.6s)]
*  But it doesn't mean the colony can continue. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=907.68s)]
*  So without a queen, a colony can't continue. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=910.36s)]
*  So as a last resort is the only time you will see female worker bees laying eggs in a colony. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=913.4399999999999s)]
*  And they will lay eggs that turn into bees that look different. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=921.28s)]
*  They're male drone bees. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=924.8s)]
*  And so their larvae and their pupae look a little bit different than the worker bees. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=925.84s)]
*  And so as a beekeeper, if you see a colony full of male honeybee babies, brood, eggs, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=930.84s)]
*  and larvae, it's a sign that a colony may be without a queen. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=937.2800000000001s)]
*  And what happens then? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=942.0s)]
*  So as a beekeeper, you can introduce a new queen to the colony and likely they'll accept [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=943.58s)]
*  her. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=949.52s)]
*  colony eggs from another colony that are female eggs, so female bee eggs. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=951.52s)]
*  Any female bee egg can be made into a queen bee. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=957.84s)]
*  So if you give a colony that's queen-less the opportunity to make their own queen, that's [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=961.46s)]
*  sometimes even better than introducing a new queen to them. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=966.68s)]
*  And the way that a queen bee is made is when the queen bee lays an egg and if it's a female [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=970.92s)]
*  worker bee egg, which most of them are because again 95% of the colony's population is female, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=977.92s)]
*  every bee in the first three days of their life, they're fed royal jelly. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=985.4s)]
*  And then they're switched to a diet of pollen and a little bit of nectar. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=990.12s)]
*  But if a baby bee is fed royal jelly through the duration of its development, it turns [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=993.92s)]
*  into a queen bee. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1000.4s)]
*  That a regular worker bee cannot give birth or cannot lay an egg that would be a queen [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1002.96s)]
*  bee or even a female bee. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1008.76s)]
*  So where does that female bee come from? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1010.88s)]
*  Only from a queen? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1012.72s)]
*  Where does, yes. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1014.4000000000001s)]
*  So a queen can only give birth to a queen. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1016.12s)]
*  A queen can lay both female and male bee eggs. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1019.9200000000001s)]
*  I shouldn't say give birth. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  So a female can lay a female, so does when a female, when a queen knows that her time [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1024.76s)]
*  is short when she's about to die, does she like make a successor? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1031.22s)]
*  Well, it's not always the queen that knows and it's more the colony that's making the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1037.22s)]
*  decision. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1041.3000000000002s)]
*  So we often think of a colony of bees being a monarchy where the queen is in charge and [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1042.7s)]
*  making all of the decisions, but that's not the case at all. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1047.94s)]
*  It's the colony making the decisions. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1051.94s)]
*  So it's all the worker bees. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1054.5800000000002s)]
*  The collective of female worker bees making that decision. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1056.26s)]
*  And they can take any female egg and turn it into a queen bee, not only by that diet [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1060.02s)]
*  of royal jelly, but they will also make the cell that the bee is born into a little bit [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1065.26s)]
*  bigger to accommodate the queen bee's larger body size. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1070.3799999999999s)]
*  So it's actually the group of female worker bees that's making that decision. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1075.08s)]
*  And the queen bee doesn't always know when she's in her final days. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1079.3799999999999s)]
*  It's the colony that would know. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1083.24s)]
*  And then the queen bees would have their pheromones would get weaker and they would prepare for [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1084.66s)]
*  having a new queen and sometimes even have a new queen develop while their old queen [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1088.46s)]
*  is still alive. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1095.22s)]
*  And in the case that you have a colony with an older queen who is failing and a new queen [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1096.5s)]
*  who just emerged from a cell, the queens will fight to the death. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1102.98s)]
*  Oh, gee. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1108.18s)]
*  And the best queen wins. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1109.18s)]
*  That's what needs to happen for the life of the bee colony. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1111.7s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1115.3s)]
*  They fight to the death. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1116.3s)]
*  What a ruthless world. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1118.18s)]
*  They have figured it out, though, how to do this and how to live in these giant societies. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1119.8600000000001s)]
*  And you know, it all works and it's remarkable. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1126.6200000000001s)]
*  It is very remarkable, but it's also very ruthless, right? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1129.66s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of crazy that they fight to the death. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1132.5800000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1135.7s)]
*  Like this poor queen, like she's done a great job. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1136.7s)]
*  She's made all these bees. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1139.26s)]
*  A lot of bees. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1141.5s)]
*  A queen bee will lay up to 2000 eggs per day. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1142.5s)]
*  I mean, she's an egg laying machine. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1145.3s)]
*  That's all she does. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1147.14s)]
*  She doesn't feed herself. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1148.14s)]
*  She doesn't clean herself. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1149.54s)]
*  She's the only bee that defecates in the hive. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1151.38s)]
*  All the other bees defecate outside the hive and she has bees that clean up after her. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1154.46s)]
*  She has like a royal court of attendant bees that follow her around and take care of all [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1158.18s)]
*  of her needs. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1163.38s)]
*  Is there ever a time where the queen, like something eats her or something attacks the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1165.1000000000001s)]
*  queen? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1170.58s)]
*  I mean, the queens will die naturally all the time. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1171.58s)]
*  Is there like an insect or anything? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1174.98s)]
*  There's nothing that would seek out the queen. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1176.9399999999998s)]
*  But you know, swarming is a dangerous endeavor and sometimes the queens don't always make [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1180.06s)]
*  it so swarming is when the bees will decide to leave their hive and make another either, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1184.9399999999998s)]
*  you know, they're trying to make another bee colony or they're trying to find a new place [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1190.62s)]
*  to live. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1193.58s)]
*  And that's a dangerous trip for the queen. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1194.58s)]
*  That's why, you know, the queen doesn't really leave the hive that often. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1197.3s)]
*  So, you know, sometimes when I'm going to remove bees, I'll find a healthy colony either [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1200.38s)]
*  without a queen or sometimes I'll find a deceased queen and I'll have to, you know, do what [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1205.7s)]
*  I need to either introduce a new queen or give them eggs or something. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1210.8600000000001s)]
*  But without that, without you intervening, what would happen to them? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1215.3400000000001s)]
*  Then the colony would naturally perish. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1218.98s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1220.7800000000002s)]
*  That would be the end of that colony. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1221.7800000000002s)]
*  What a fascinating creature. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1224.7800000000002s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's a superorganism. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1226.9s)]
*  So that queen bee is really, you can think of her as the reproductive organ of this larger [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1228.7800000000002s)]
*  being that is the bee colony. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1234.42s)]
*  And so without her, without that, it can't continue. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1237.26s)]
*  So I've seen videos of you where you've moved colonies of bees and one of the things you [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1242.0s)]
*  do is you isolate the queen and then you move the queen to a new place and all the bees [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1248.7s)]
*  go with the queen. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1253.5400000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1254.8200000000002s)]
*  So that's how you like, say if you went to someone's attic and you found a swarm of [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1255.82s)]
*  bees up there or what would that be? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1258.82s)]
*  A colony of bees? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1260.46s)]
*  A colony of bees, yep. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1261.46s)]
*  So you would then, you have to figure out a way to get them out and then find the queen. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1263.1s)]
*  How do you find the queen? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1268.98s)]
*  A lot of patience, a lot of practice. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1271.1399999999999s)]
*  Do you have to take apart the combs? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1273.22s)]
*  Yep. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1275.58s)]
*  So, you know, I just start working my way through the hive and I'm always looking for the queen. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1276.58s)]
*  Finding the queen in a bee removal is the key to a successful bee removal because obviously [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1283.94s)]
*  we've talked about the importance of the queen but the colony really wants to be with their [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1290.02s)]
*  queen and so they will naturally follow her and once you find the queen and have control [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1294.6200000000001s)]
*  of the queen, you can control the colony. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1301.88s)]
*  And so that's why it's so important for me as a beekeeper during these removals to always [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1304.5800000000002s)]
*  find the queen. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1309.2s)]
*  So how much time will that take? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1310.5800000000002s)]
*  It's always different. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1312.5s)]
*  It depends on the removal. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1314.02s)]
*  You know, if it's a really, really large hive, I mean if it's five, eight feet of comb in [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1316.14s)]
*  the walls of someone's shed or in someone's backyard compost bin or whatnot, I mean, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1322.1000000000001s)]
*  it can take a long time. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1331.38s)]
*  Some of these bee removals will take hours. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1333.1200000000001s)]
*  Sometimes I have to go back the next day. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1335.46s)]
*  But then sometimes you get lucky and she's on, you know, one of the first few combs you [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1338.1200000000001s)]
*  pull up and she looks different. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1341.6s)]
*  She's bigger than all the other bees. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1344.7199999999998s)]
*  She has a different job, right? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1346.24s)]
*  She's the only bee laying eggs in the colony so that naturally looks a little different. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1347.76s)]
*  She also has this kind of retinue that follows her around this circle of bees that is guiding [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1353.04s)]
*  her and giving her these signals on what to do. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1359.52s)]
*  So there's clues that the bees will give you on her location. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1362.1599999999999s)]
*  And, you know, if I'm moving bees from point A to point B and I have, and I don't know [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1366.6s)]
*  where the queen is, typically where most of the bees congregate. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1372.52s)]
*  Here's a video. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1376.7199999999998s)]
*  Wow, I never watched these again. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1379.2399999999998s)]
*  And so that's like a little clip that you use. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1381.6799999999998s)]
*  That's the queen in there. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1384.2399999999998s)]
*  You've found the queen. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1385.32s)]
*  I tell you what, that moment feels so good. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1387.8s)]
*  It's hard to capture it in a video. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1389.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh, that's a bee telling the other bees where to go. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1391.6799999999998s)]
*  She's fanning her Nazinov gland. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1394.84s)]
*  So you can actually see the Nazinov gland in that video, in that little clip. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1396.8799999999999s)]
*  So on the back of her abdomen. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1400.6799999999998s)]
*  Wow, thank you. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1403.08s)]
*  Jamie, on the wall. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1405.08s)]
*  Yeah, the back of her abdomen. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1408.08s)]
*  You can kind of see it. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1409.32s)]
*  So see how she has all those little black stripes. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1410.32s)]
*  And then at the end you can, yeah, that's, it's a little gland that's exposed and that's [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1412.76s)]
*  one of the pheromones, the ways they communicate. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1418.4399999999998s)]
*  She is signaling to all the other bees where to go. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1422.0400000000002s)]
*  And she's letting them know, you can see them start to move down and into the new hive. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1425.3200000000002s)]
*  It was getting dark. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1430.2s)]
*  I was racing daylight there. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1431.2s)]
*  And then they will eventually do the rest of the work for you. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1433.52s)]
*  You're doing this with no beekeeper suit, nothing on your hands, nothing. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1437.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this was a really great, great colony of bees. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1441.64s)]
*  Are there bad colonies of bees? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1445.68s)]
*  There are certainly bees that can be more defensive, but. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1449.3999999999999s)]
*  Why would that be? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1453.24s)]
*  Well, if they don't have all the resources they need, if they're in a bad spot, if they [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1454.24s)]
*  don't have a queen, a large colony tends to be more defensive than a smaller one because [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1457.96s)]
*  they have more resources to defend. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1463.76s)]
*  So sometimes you'll see me do this and it's a small swarm. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1466.48s)]
*  So it's a swarm where there's no comb, there's no beeswax, there's no nectar, pollen or honey, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1471.76s)]
*  there's no baby bees. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1479.0s)]
*  So they don't have anything to defend. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1480.04s)]
*  And they're much gentler, you know, in those cases most of the time. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1482.28s)]
*  But every colony is different. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1487.16s)]
*  Every colony has a different, you know, behavior and is in a different set of circumstances. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1489.36s)]
*  So it's I never know what I'm getting myself into. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1496.4s)]
*  So what would cause them to be there if they didn't have those resources? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1499.28s)]
*  To be where? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1503.08s)]
*  Like in a, like in the wall right there? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1504.08s)]
*  Those bees had been there for a number of years. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1506.48s)]
*  I don't know exactly how long. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1508.08s)]
*  But those bees likely were relocating, looking for a new place to live because maybe their [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1510.44s)]
*  hive something happened to it, it got damaged, maybe, you know, they felt like they didn't [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1515.92s)]
*  have the resources they needed around their hive and they wanted to move where there were [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1520.36s)]
*  better resources. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1525.8799999999999s)]
*  But that cavity in particular, a wall or the side of a shed or the floor of a shed is a [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1527.76s)]
*  very common place that I remove bees from. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1534.64s)]
*  And that's because it's a common place bees choose to live. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1538.56s)]
*  It replicates what, I mean, it's so ideal for what the bees want in an environment. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1541.48s)]
*  It almost is, you know, the same kind of width of a beehive that's space in between the floor. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1547.2s)]
*  They like a closed environment that's climate controlled with a small entrance that they [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1554.84s)]
*  can easily defend. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1558.92s)]
*  They like it, you know, protected from the weather and from the elements. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1560.2s)]
*  They need a lot of space. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1563.76s)]
*  So in those backyard sheds, people tend to not go in them very often. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1565.52s)]
*  And, you know, the bees aren't bothered by people. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1571.16s)]
*  So that's a pretty common place that I'll do removals from. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1573.8s)]
*  So when you go to a place like that and you see them, that's how you know you don't need [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1577.3200000000002s)]
*  an outfit, you don't because you were just like, well, I mean, now you're now you're [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1581.16s)]
*  all. Yeah. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1586.04s)]
*  So I saw through that and sometimes they don't like the vibrations of the tools that I'm [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1588.32s)]
*  using. And this is the first I have no idea what to expect of how defensive they'll be. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1594.56s)]
*  So. So this is your first exposure to these particular bees. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1598.8799999999999s)]
*  You're cutting through for the folks that are just listening. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1602.24s)]
*  She's at a shed and she's sawing through the side of the shed where the bees were using [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1605.52s)]
*  my saw. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1612.52s)]
*  There's your voice. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1614.92s)]
*  Very common soothing. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1616.08s)]
*  And are you getting stung here? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1617.6399999999999s)]
*  No, these bees are not trying to sting me at all. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1619.96s)]
*  This was a this is wild. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1624.96s)]
*  So that is they've developed these combs in these almost like you can see the honey right [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1627.52s)]
*  there. Yeah. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1633.28s)]
*  But it's almost like like a commercial beehive sort of set up. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1634.32s)]
*  You know, if you think of dividing that wall up and stacking them on top of each other, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1638.48s)]
*  that's a traditional beehive. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1642.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. But so now you're you've gotten rid of the mask and you you're still just handling [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1645.52s)]
*  this. Sure. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1650.68s)]
*  You just took a bite of it. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1651.68s)]
*  You're a psycho. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1653.1200000000001s)]
*  There's bees there. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1655.04s)]
*  I've been working hard. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1656.28s)]
*  That was it. That was a long removal. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1657.16s)]
*  There's bees flying around your face and you're just biting into that honeycomb. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1660.0s)]
*  There's bees all over that thing. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1664.08s)]
*  They really aren't. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1665.44s)]
*  I mean, they're not what they're not trying to sting me. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1666.72s)]
*  There are a lot of bees there. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1669.48s)]
*  I understand. But you're just you just took a bite with bees to the left and the right [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1670.84s)]
*  of your mouth. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1674.88s)]
*  I tell you what, you're watching me at my most joyful moments. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1675.72s)]
*  I love doing this. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1681.3200000000002s)]
*  That's your most joyful moment. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1682.24s)]
*  Just take a bite out of the house. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1683.5600000000002s)]
*  No, but this whole removal process, there's nothing I'd rather be doing. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1685.5200000000002s)]
*  And so that's what you love to do the most is to find them. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1689.8000000000002s)]
*  And I almost wish someone could like monitor my brain and watch it light up as I do this [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1692.8000000000002s)]
*  work, because there's so many points that are just so exciting throughout the process. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1699.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, I don't really know what to expect beforehand. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1704.76s)]
*  So I get there and I see the hive for the first time and I go, wow, it it might fill the whole wall. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1707.6s)]
*  And sure enough, you know, then once I saw through the side and get through it, it does. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1713.64s)]
*  And there's definitely another dopamine hit when I first see that beehive. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1718.84s)]
*  And just like you said, wow, look at that comb. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1722.24s)]
*  I mean, for me, it's times 10. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1724.6s)]
*  And for the folks listening, this is a massive comb. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1727.96s)]
*  Like this this whole thing is like looks like it's about 12 feet tall and the comb goes [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1730.8799999999999s)]
*  all the way up the side in six or seven different rows. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1737.0s)]
*  So there's like how many bees are in there? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1741.84s)]
*  If you had to take a wild guess. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1743.56s)]
*  I hate doing this, but I mean, maybe two hundred thousand, two hundred and fifty thousand. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1745.04s)]
*  That is a large beehive. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1751.4399999999998s)]
*  Those bees have been there for some time. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1753.56s)]
*  And not only do we know because of the size, but also the age of I'm sorry, the color of [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1755.12s)]
*  the comb. So you can see that it's darker. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1760.56s)]
*  It's almost dark brown. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1763.2s)]
*  And if you think of, oh, that's a beautiful shot of the comb with a bunch of pollen. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1765.08s)]
*  So it's full of those brightly colored different. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1770.36s)]
*  See, there's even some white pollen at the top. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1773.36s)]
*  There's white and orange and yellow and red colored pollen mixed in with some nectar. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1775.48s)]
*  And the pollen is the bees protein source. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1780.96s)]
*  So pollen is actually a great source of protein. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1784.0s)]
*  I think there's like two grams of protein per tablespoon of pollen. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1786.52s)]
*  Pound for pound, it's a better source of pollen and beef or chicken. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1790.6399999999999s)]
*  But most better source of protein, better source of protein. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1793.6399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. Is it as bioavailable? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1796.0s)]
*  But most people aren't going to eat a pound of pollen, of course. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1798.6399999999999s)]
*  And it grows. It doesn't have much of a taste or flavor. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1801.0s)]
*  To me, it kind of tastes like wheatgrass almost. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1805.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, it's not sweet. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1810.2s)]
*  Shake or something. Yes, it's very, very mild. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1812.0s)]
*  Not much, not much flavor, in my opinion. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1814.9199999999998s)]
*  Is it as bioavailable as like chicken or beef? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1817.52s)]
*  Because, you know, there's certain plant proteins that aren't that bioavailable, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1820.24s)]
*  even though there's a high gram of protein per ounce. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1824.08s)]
*  We wouldn't want to harvest as much pollen from bees as we do [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1827.9599999999998s)]
*  other protein sources, of course. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1832.12s)]
*  And, you know, this is their food source. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1834.32s)]
*  So we shouldn't really be taking this to consume. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1838.36s)]
*  I'm not saying to take it from them, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1842.7199999999998s)]
*  but I know that bee pollen is something that people do supplement their diet. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1844.16s)]
*  Yes. And I just was curious if you know that if it's bioavailable. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1847.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. OK. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1851.4s)]
*  So as you are. I guess I don't know what bioavailable means. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1853.4s)]
*  Bioavailable is like this. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1856.6000000000001s)]
*  Some of the most bioavailable protein is meat. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1858.24s)]
*  Whereas like if you have 10 grams of, say, venison, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1862.28s)]
*  it's more bioavailable than 10 grams of protein from, say, broccoli. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1868.72s)]
*  The protein that is in plants is less bioavailable. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1874.3200000000002s)]
*  Your body doesn't process it as well. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1877.64s)]
*  Oh, meaning how we process it? Yes. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1879.1200000000001s)]
*  I have no idea how our bodies process bee pollen. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1881.0400000000002s)]
*  You're only interested in bees. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1883.48s)]
*  I like to spend most of my time with bees. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1886.24s)]
*  You like bees more than you like people? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1888.4s)]
*  I spend most of my time with bees. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1890.28s)]
*  And I mean, I just naturally I don't spend that much time with people. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1892.4s)]
*  I spend most of it with bees. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1896.76s)]
*  You know, you kind of like bees more than people. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1899.92s)]
*  I love bees. Wow. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1903.44s)]
*  So that sound, by the way, if everybody's listening, you're like, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1904.88s)]
*  is there a fan on? No, there's a hive here. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1907.76s)]
*  She brought a small colony. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1911.0800000000002s)]
*  How would you would you call that? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1913.68s)]
*  You know, this is an observation hive and there is a small colony in it [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1915.1200000000001s)]
*  that I removed from just the back of a mailbox a couple of weeks ago. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1918.8400000000001s)]
*  This is the entire size of the colony. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1923.64s)]
*  It's it's quite small. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1925.64s)]
*  And unfortunately, less than 25 percent of colonies or swarms like this [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1926.88s)]
*  make it through their first year. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1932.0800000000002s)]
*  And this was just a swarm. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1935.04s)]
*  So there were there was no. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1937.3200000000002s)]
*  Hive, there was no beeswax pollen, nectar, baby bees. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1940.0800000000002s)]
*  So everything within this hive was given [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1944.04s)]
*  to them by me from another colony, from a donor colony. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1948.2s)]
*  So you found them in a mailbox? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1951.48s)]
*  I found them. They were kind of hanging like on the outside of the mailbox. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1954.28s)]
*  There was like a post with four by fours. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1957.5600000000002s)]
*  And you notice that there's a queen there. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1959.92s)]
*  So you took the queen, put her in this little hive thing. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1961.72s)]
*  It was actually a pretty quick grab. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1966.3200000000002s)]
*  It was a pretty small colony. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1968.8000000000002s)]
*  So I just kind of scoop them into the box I was putting them in. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1970.28s)]
*  And then, yes, I had a queen clip that I put the queen into. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1974.8000000000002s)]
*  So I'll capture the queen and I'll put her in a queen clip. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1977.6000000000001s)]
*  And it has these little slots where she is the largest bee. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1981.48s)]
*  So she can't escape. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1985.2s)]
*  But the other bees, the worker bees, because they're smaller, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1986.44s)]
*  they can go in and out through the clip and take care of the queen. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1989.68s)]
*  Whoa. So you got her in a little prison. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1994.0s)]
*  Temporary, a temporary. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1996.8799999999999s)]
*  She's in there right now in the little prison. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=1998.48s)]
*  She's not in the little prison in there. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2000.32s)]
*  She's roaming about freely, hopefully laying eggs and doing what she needs to do. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2001.76s)]
*  So when you are removing bees like you did from that shed, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2006.12s)]
*  there comes a point where you realize that, you know, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2010.56s)]
*  you can manage this without your equipment. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2014.32s)]
*  Is that when you're the most happy, when you can take the gloves off [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2016.9199999999998s)]
*  and take the headgear off and all that jazz? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2019.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't know if it's when I mean, I definitely love working [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2023.48s)]
*  alongside the bees without the equipment. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2026.1599999999999s)]
*  It's definitely when I'm the most comfortable. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2028.52s)]
*  But, yeah, I mean, there's no place I'd rather be than [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2031.84s)]
*  elbows deep in a high full of bees. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2035.9599999999998s)]
*  Wow. How did you get involved in this? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2037.6s)]
*  My whole life, I've just loved bugs. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2040.6799999999998s)]
*  I sort of came out of the box, a bug lover and an animal lover. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2043.28s)]
*  And I was really lucky to have parents that encouraged and supported that as well. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2047.92s)]
*  And I spent a lot of nights and weekends and time in my backyard [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2053.7599999999998s)]
*  as a kid collecting bugs and putting them in jars and trying to keep them as pets [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2058.72s)]
*  or trying to study and observe them. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2063.6s)]
*  My childhood idols growing up were Dr. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2065.88s)]
*  Jane Goodall and Diane Fossey, and I wanted to be just like them. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2068.24s)]
*  But, you know, as a seven or eight year old, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2073.44s)]
*  I couldn't exactly go to the jungles of Africa to study primates. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2075.36s)]
*  So I went in my backyard and I collected bugs. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2078.4s)]
*  They were everywhere. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2081.52s)]
*  They were easy to find and easy to pick up. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2082.52s)]
*  And my love of bugs just continued my entire life. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2085.52s)]
*  So over 10 years ago, I took a beekeeping class and I started [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2090.84s)]
*  keeping a hive in my backyard in central Austin and really just fell in love [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2094.6000000000004s)]
*  with honeybees and became fascinated by their world and being able to step inside of it. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2101.64s)]
*  So I started my beekeeping business when I still had a full time job. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2107.4399999999996s)]
*  And I was doing bee work on nights, weekends, lunch breaks. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2112.24s)]
*  But it was really all I wanted to do with my time. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2117.7999999999997s)]
*  So what was your other job? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2120.3999999999996s)]
*  I was a communications director for various nonprofit associations. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2122.04s)]
*  And I loved my job. It was a great job. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2126.72s)]
*  I worked with amazing people, but it just wasn't bees. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2129.24s)]
*  It wasn't what I wanted to do all every day. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2132.56s)]
*  And I didn't understand, you know, it didn't feel right for me to go and sit in an office. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2134.8399999999997s)]
*  I wasn't that person. I wanted to be outside. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2139.24s)]
*  So so, yeah, I started my business while, you know, I still had a full time job. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2141.2799999999997s)]
*  And in 2018, I quit my full time job and became a full time professional beekeeper. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2146.7999999999997s)]
*  That's amazing. So do you have a formal education in bees? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2152.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2156.52s)]
*  So did you learn this from books? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2157.72s)]
*  Did you learn this from videos? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2160.2s)]
*  Like, how did you learn this? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2161.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, really, the best way to learn something like this is experience. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2162.9199999999996s)]
*  And that's how I've learned the most is just doing as much be work as I can. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2166.56s)]
*  When I started my business, I didn't really know what my business was. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2172.8399999999997s)]
*  I just wanted to be a beekeeper. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2177.08s)]
*  And so it really started as organically as it could. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2179.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, people would ask me for beekeeping services. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2183.6s)]
*  So folks would say, can you keep bees on our property? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2186.16s)]
*  We want bees, but we don't want to be beekeepers ourselves. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2188.64s)]
*  Or can you give us a private lesson? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2191.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, you've been doing this far longer than we have. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2193.68s)]
*  We're first year beekeepers. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2195.8799999999997s)]
*  I got asked to teach beekeeping classes and eventually I got asked to do live bee removals. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2197.8799999999997s)]
*  And for me, that was just what I felt in love with as a beekeeper was being able to go [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2202.8799999999997s)]
*  into a hive and see how bees live and work naturally without a human making decisions for them. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2211.0s)]
*  You know, it allowed me to learn more about bees and I could see [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2219.0s)]
*  I could see so much that I would never experience in the little boxes that we as beekeepers keep bees in. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2223.2799999999997s)]
*  So, you know, it really just a lot of experience and doing a lot of a lot of bee removals. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2231.24s)]
*  And, you know, of course books as well. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2238.64s)]
*  But this is one of the things you can't really learn from a book. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2241.44s)]
*  You just sort of have to get out there and do and see bees and see how they work together. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2244.8799999999997s)]
*  And and I started small. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2249.68s)]
*  I started not with, you know, hives that were that had eight feet of comb in removing them from a backyard shed. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2251.3599999999997s)]
*  I started with water meter boxes. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2257.96s)]
*  So water meter boxes are those things everybody has in their front yard. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2260.68s)]
*  You know, it's a box about a foot deep and it has that plastic lid with a small opening. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2264.32s)]
*  And it's one of bees favorite places to build. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2269.1200000000003s)]
*  It's one of the most common calls I get as a beekeepers to remove bees from these boxes. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2271.96s)]
*  And starting out, I thought, you know, it was the most controlled environment. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2277.52s)]
*  I could start with doing the removal process because you just never know what you're getting into. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2284.6000000000004s)]
*  But at least I knew this is always going to be the size. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2289.5600000000004s)]
*  The hive is never going to be much larger. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2292.7599999999998s)]
*  I won't get surprises like taking paneling off a wall and finding eight feet of comb. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2294.88s)]
*  Right. And they were relatively small, which was easy for me and easy for me to handle. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2300.04s)]
*  But, you know, I just did as much of those as I could for as long as I could. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2307.24s)]
*  And then eventually started to do more and more removals and larger ones and just a lot of experience. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2311.92s)]
*  So all the information that you know about in terms of like pheromones and how they construct the hive [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2319.4s)]
*  and how they create a queen and all that stuff, that's all stuff you've gotten from books? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2325.56s)]
*  Books, online beekeeping, conferences and events. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2330.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, talking to other beekeepers. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2334.28s)]
*  Just, you know, I always like to say I'm an expert of my own experiences. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2337.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, I'm not a bee biologist or I'm not an entomologist studying bees. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2342.8s)]
*  I just really love bees and, you know, have been so fortunate that I get to live a life [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2348.32s)]
*  where I get to work alongside them every day and I learn so much from them. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2354.6800000000003s)]
*  It's so fascinating how different human beings are because that I find bees interesting, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2359.44s)]
*  but I couldn't imagine that being my favorite thing to do. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2364.36s)]
*  But with you, just the way you talk about it, you light up. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2367.2400000000002s)]
*  It's so obvious that people are we vary so much. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2369.7200000000003s)]
*  It's so interesting to watch someone who is absolutely enthralled with something that just seems like [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2374.32s)]
*  most people would not be enthralled by. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2382.04s)]
*  Yes, I get that a lot. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2385.92s)]
*  I mean, when I do these bee removals, I meet a lot of people who are so happy to see me [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2387.8s)]
*  and they were just terrified of the bees, you know. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2391.96s)]
*  And that's an element that doesn't always come through. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2394.76s)]
*  Like in the videos that you see me do with the bees and working with the bees, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2398.6400000000003s)]
*  there's this other side that you're really helping people. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2402.24s)]
*  I mean, when I go and remove bees from a place, it's like you're giving these people back [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2404.8799999999997s)]
*  a sense of security in their own space. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2410.2s)]
*  And that's a great feeling as well. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2412.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, so there's there's a lot of I mean, that's why I love doing this. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2414.8799999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of different sides of it. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2419.8399999999997s)]
*  Do you find it enjoyable to sort of educate these people whose homes have been invaded by bees, too, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2422.16s)]
*  and maybe give them a sense of peace? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2429.72s)]
*  Because a lot of people are terrified of bees. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2431.08s)]
*  They see bees, they just want to run away. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2433.2s)]
*  Whereas you come along and you're so calm and you're not like this gigantic, imposing, scary person. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2435.52s)]
*  You're very sweet and calm. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2440.96s)]
*  And then you're there touching them with no gloves on. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2443.6s)]
*  So then maybe you're like, oh, maybe I need to rethink bees. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2446.3199999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. You know, I will say that I'm really lucky. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2450.56s)]
*  Most the people I meet naturally, they're on the side of bees because they called a beekeeper [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2453.68s)]
*  to remove the bees versus an exterminator or doing something else. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2458.04s)]
*  But a lot of times I show up and there was a fear of the bees. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2461.96s)]
*  And then, you know, the folks will watch me work, you know, through the glass of their back door. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2467.24s)]
*  I've had people in their cars before watch me from the safety of their car. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2474.84s)]
*  And, you know, by the end of it, they're out there asking if they can open the door [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2479.16s)]
*  and come out and take a photo or whatnot. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2483.32s)]
*  And, you know, and I'm showing them the queen or whatnot in the clip. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2485.2799999999997s)]
*  But and it was interesting doing doing this work through the pandemic when, you know, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2488.8399999999997s)]
*  a lot of the times I would do bee removals and I wouldn't see people that often because I would show up [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2496.08s)]
*  and they weren't there. And, you know, us beekeepers were kind of like the original social distances. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2500.68s)]
*  We show up and nobody wants to be around us. We're used to being alone. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2506.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't think it's an uncommon trait of beekeepers to be more introverted, you know, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2510.8s)]
*  and just want to spend their time around these insects who may or may not be so happy to see them. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2515.6400000000003s)]
*  But I would show up and I would have people during the height of the of quarantine, you know, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2521.5600000000004s)]
*  I would have people peering through their windows with their whole family. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2528.4s)]
*  And parents would tell me this is the most exciting thing the kids have seen in months, you know, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2531.5600000000004s)]
*  is have someone come here and watch and watch the bee removal process. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2536.04s)]
*  What is the what is your mindset? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2540.44s)]
*  Like, why is it so enjoyable when it's just you alone with the bees and you're removing this hive from a shed or wherever it is [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2542.84s)]
*  and putting it into one of these things? Like, what is this? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2552.36s)]
*  What is your mindset? Are you just at peace? Are you just in the moment? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2556.0s)]
*  Like, what's going on there? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2559.88s)]
*  There is something incredibly meditative about being inside of a beehive and with a colony. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2562.88s)]
*  Whatever you're thinking about beforehand, whatever was on your to do list or whatever has been on your mind all day, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2570.76s)]
*  the second you open that hive, it all melts away. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2579.0s)]
*  And you have to be so focused on every movement you make when you're working alongside bees, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2583.32s)]
*  not only for your safety, but for theirs as well. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2589.8s)]
*  And that really just makes you it forces you to be in the present. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2593.6000000000004s)]
*  And it's hard to explain that to people who have a fear of bees and assume that it's chaotic inside of a hive and it's so disorganized. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2598.2400000000002s)]
*  And why would you want to be around these tens of thousands of stinging insects? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2609.76s)]
*  But it's not like that at all. Most of the time, it's incredibly calm and orderly. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2613.7200000000003s)]
*  All the bees have a job. And there's also a great sense of humility that comes with it. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2619.32s)]
*  And just watching these creatures work and do all of this amazing work within the beehive and, you know, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2625.56s)]
*  knowing that these tens of thousands of creatures are all working together for the good of the colony. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2636.0800000000004s)]
*  It's just a wonderful experience for me anyhow. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2642.92s)]
*  But I can understand how people it would terrify people. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2647.2s)]
*  When you're doing this, do you feel like you are in some way communicating with these bees? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2650.68s)]
*  Like, are you putting out energy saying like, I'm here to help. I'm your friend. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2658.0s)]
*  I'm not a danger. Like, do you have a mindset or are you just in the moment completely? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2663.24s)]
*  Like, how are you? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2668.96s)]
*  I think it's a mutual communication. You know, I'm trying to read their behavior and they're probably trying to read mine as well. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2670.64s)]
*  To see if I'm a threat. But from the very first second that I meet the bees, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2677.16s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out what they need and, you know, what their situation is like. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2682.04s)]
*  And they're trying to read my behavior just like I'm trying to read theirs. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2687.8399999999997s)]
*  It's no different than you reading, you know, your dog's behavior. They wag their tail. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2690.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, they're happy. They put their ears back. You know, they're scared. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2695.04s)]
*  The bees will send you signs and signals and communicate to you how they're feeling. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2698.08s)]
*  You know, of course, they'll start stinging you if they're not feeling well. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2702.3999999999996s)]
*  And if they are feeling defensive. But, you know, they'll before that, they'll sort of ping you. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2706.68s)]
*  And there's a frequency pitch that changes sometimes, you know, in a hive that's maybe a little bit more defensive. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2711.04s)]
*  So a frequency in terms of like the sound. Sure. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2717.72s)]
*  And so it's I think the communication goes back and forth. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2721.48s)]
*  And I hope that they can pick up on my behavior as well, that I'm not there to harm them. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2725.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm not ripping open their hive as quickly and as forcefully as possible. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2730.08s)]
*  And I'm not, you know, I'm doing everything with a lot of care and precision or as much as I can. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2734.2s)]
*  And I hope that they pick up on that, too. I certainly think that they do. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2739.9199999999996s)]
*  So it's the movement. But is it also the mindset? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2745.52s)]
*  Is it like a vibe that you're putting out? Are you like saying in your mind, I'm your friend. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2749.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm here to help out. Like, are you? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2755.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm probably not saying it in my mind. I'm probably talking to him. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2757.12s)]
*  Oh, really? You talk out loud to the bees? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2759.64s)]
*  Yes, all the time. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2761.64s)]
*  It's just me and them, you know, I mean, and you're really working alongside them. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2763.92s)]
*  And I I like to think that at some point during the removal process, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2767.6800000000003s)]
*  they realize that I'm offering them something better, you know, after I've opened their hive and removed half the wall or what have you. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2772.96s)]
*  It's they know that this new hive is where their food is, where their baby bees are, and it's just a better place for them. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2780.52s)]
*  So I hope they know that I'm on their side. I certainly, you know, try to tell them that. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2786.6000000000004s)]
*  And yes, I talk to them. But I don't know. It's I mean, it's a it's just a wonderful experience, you know, and every bee removal is different. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2792.44s)]
*  Well, at the very least, they seem to accept it. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2801.28s)]
*  Yes, they do. I mean, they seem to not mind, you know, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2804.12s)]
*  when I pick up their queen and move her into a new box, which you would think, you know, that would maybe would anger them. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2809.44s)]
*  But, you know, the colony all works together and it's that super organism. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2814.6s)]
*  So they they they all want to be together and they're all doing what's best for the good of the colony. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2819.2799999999997s)]
*  And so I sometimes think that if I'm doing that as well, then, you know, it's a lot easier to do my job for sure. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2825.4399999999996s)]
*  Now, as you've done this, have you become friends with other beekeepers? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2831.7599999999998s)]
*  And do they have a similar mindset and similar experiences to the way you approach it? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2836.4399999999996s)]
*  I have met some wonderful beekeepers and have some wonderful beekeeping friends and everybody has their own way of keeping bees. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2842.6s)]
*  It's very much a craft. You know, it takes a lot of skill, of course. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2852.56s)]
*  I think it's an art form, especially the bee removal process. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2856.68s)]
*  There's it takes a lot of creativity and everybody will do it in a different way. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2860.7999999999997s)]
*  And everybody has their own opinions about their bees or what's best for their bees. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2865.2s)]
*  And the beekeeping community can be divisive. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2870.6s)]
*  But, yeah, just because everybody has a different opinion on what the best way is to keep bees. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2874.04s)]
*  And that probably stems from a lack of understanding that we all don't know all the answers to all the questions. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2881.56s)]
*  So what's like the major points of contention between the beekeeping community? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2887.7999999999997s)]
*  Just different techniques for keeping bees. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2893.2s)]
*  You know, some folks have different control methods for different pests and diseases. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2896.72s)]
*  Some folks like to do it more naturally. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2902.7999999999997s)]
*  There's just there's a lot of different ways people keep bees all around the world. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2904.44s)]
*  And I think everyone's doing it the best they can. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2909.12s)]
*  But every everybody has a different idea on how to keep bees. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2912.3599999999997s)]
*  But also everybody has a different reason for keeping bees. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2916.9199999999996s)]
*  And so they might have different management techniques for that. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2919.7999999999997s)]
*  Do you use is it like the smoke? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2923.6s)]
*  Is that like a point of contention? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2926.24s)]
*  No, not used to too much smoke. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2928.04s)]
*  Don't use any smoke. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2930.04s)]
*  No, that the don't use too much smoke, but always use smoke. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2931.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes. So the smoke, it will mask their alarm pheromones. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2935.64s)]
*  So one of the pheromones, this chemical sense that they communicate with is an alarm pheromone that, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2941.16s)]
*  you know, lets the other bees know that there might be trouble in the hive. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2947.12s)]
*  So maybe me, maybe a beekeeper coming in and that will make it harder for the bees to communicate. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2950.4399999999996s)]
*  But also what it does and what I use it more for is, you know, I'll always use it at the beginning of a removal. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2955.48s)]
*  But or when you go into any beehive, but it's the best tool for moving the bees around. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2962.64s)]
*  So if I need to move the bees around, I'm going to have my smoker, because if you and I were sitting around a campfire right now [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2969.44s)]
*  and the smoke wafted in your direction, what would you do? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2976.84s)]
*  Get away. You would move and the bees react the same way. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2979.56s)]
*  So, you know, there's a certain point where you know that the bees are not going to be that defensive. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2981.8s)]
*  And, you know, you might still use your smoker a lot if you're just trying to move them around because they're always going to move away from it. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2988.4s)]
*  So it's it's, you know, one of the best tools we have and beekeepers, we don't really use a lot of tools. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=2994.7200000000003s)]
*  It's pretty simple kind of, you know, there's simple tools and simple equipment, but the smoker is is the most important. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3000.04s)]
*  What is in the smoker? What kind of smoke is that? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3008.52s)]
*  Whatever. I mean, for me, it's yeah, whatever is laying around. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3010.96s)]
*  You know, I like to use a lot of pine straw, pine needles, burlap sacks. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3013.6s)]
*  I get burlap sacks. So you just burn things and you put them in that device and then you just blow the smoke on them. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3017.8s)]
*  That's it. And when you're doing this, is there a specific amount of time you apply the smoke for before you start moving or do you just play it by ear? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3024.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, it's different for every colony. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3033.84s)]
*  But, you know, it's just a little bit of smoke will go a long ways and you don't want to do too much. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3035.76s)]
*  But, you know, once they start kind of reacting to it and you can see them settle down or move away from it. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3041.44s)]
*  And so it's it's just different every time. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3047.8s)]
*  When did you start putting all of this stuff on social media? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3050.8s)]
*  I mean, I've been sharing stuff about bees for a long time on Instagram, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3056.6400000000003s)]
*  but I started to share more of the bee removal process in, I guess it was 2020. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3062.36s)]
*  Well, that's probably when I found out about you. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3070.44s)]
*  But you were you trying to educate people about it? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3073.48s)]
*  You're doing it because it's fun. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3077.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, I was just sharing the work that bees and beekeepers do every day and. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3079.6400000000003s)]
*  Could have never expected so many people to see it or be interested in it. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3087.68s)]
*  But, you know, as soon as I started to kind of put these put the bee removal process together [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3095.72s)]
*  in like the one minute edited down format that these platforms would allow and kind of play to. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3101.92s)]
*  People just really seem to be interested in it, which is great, because it's a fascinating process. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3110.3199999999997s)]
*  And I mean, no one sitting here today is more shocked than me. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3114.96s)]
*  Then, you know, to have to have to put out a video and get, you know, 24 million views in 24 hours. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3119.88s)]
*  Yeah, is I mean, it's an insane experience. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3127.12s)]
*  Is that on TikTok or what is that? Yeah, TikTok is bizarre. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3131.36s)]
*  It's the amount of views you get on TikTok is very strange. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3134.96s)]
*  It's significant, I'll say. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3138.52s)]
*  I mean, mind blowing. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3140.96s)]
*  And, you know, you can see the numbers go up after you push that button. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3142.12s)]
*  And it's I mean, the first time, you know, I had I started to post maybe in the spring of 2020 on TikTok. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3146.12s)]
*  And by August, I had a video. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3156.12s)]
*  I posted a video in August that received 24 million views in 24 hours. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3159.48s)]
*  And my life changed. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3164.4s)]
*  I mean, with the push of a button, really, you know, not even overnight. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3167.48s)]
*  It was I had emails from everybody that had a production company, it seemed like. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3170.44s)]
*  And, you know, just having that many people see you is a mind blowing experience. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3176.16s)]
*  But then I what I thought was like the most viral someone could go. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3181.88s)]
*  I thought that was it. You know, in March of twenty, twenty one, about six months later, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3186.0s)]
*  I posted another video and it got 50 million views in 24 hours. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3190.48s)]
*  And it was just unreal. That's crazy. It's crazy. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3194.28s)]
*  That's more than anybody who's ever seen Titanic. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3199.44s)]
*  Like, I'm just is that true? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3202.52s)]
*  I mean, how many times how many people have bought? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3204.32s)]
*  I guess it's no. It's got to be. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3207.04s)]
*  I wonder. Definitely more than like Black Adam. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3210.08s)]
*  What would I say? Ticket sales? Yeah. OK. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3212.76s)]
*  I've had someone tell me that I've had a few videos that. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3215.84s)]
*  More people have seen than the Super Bowl. Yeah, I'm sure. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3220.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, what's the Super Bowl? How many people's Super Bowl? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3223.48s)]
*  It's probably close. 50 million. 50 million. It's huge. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3225.8s)]
*  And that's only the first day they get, you know, then these videos would keep getting views. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3230.2000000000003s)]
*  And it was just I mean, it was insane. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3234.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm probably wrong about the Titanic. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3236.36s)]
*  Oh, this is numbers. Hold on. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3237.6800000000003s)]
*  Was that the numbers? The amount of money that it's made? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3239.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's a problem because it's hard to figure out how much a ticket costs. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3242.0800000000004s)]
*  But like, like, let's what is a what is the biggest hit show on television? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3246.5200000000004s)]
*  Is there a hit show on television anymore? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3252.84s)]
*  Television is giving way to the Internet. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3255.56s)]
*  Like, what's the well, so like at the height all in the family, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3259.64s)]
*  most watch TV finales of all time, right? Yeah. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3263.96s)]
*  All in the family. 40 million. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3266.52s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3268.92s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3271.92s)]
*  Why? There's more than I have to have higher. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3273.12s)]
*  But I was just saying. Right. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3274.84s)]
*  But that's pretty good. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3275.7599999999998s)]
*  That's a pretty good comparison, though. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3277.2799999999997s)]
*  40 million. And you did that in, you know, a couple hours on Tiktok [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3279.08s)]
*  with an iPhone, not like with an iPhone that I just happened to set up on a rock. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3283.12s)]
*  And the video that got 50 million views in 24 hours, I had that [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3288.08s)]
*  that be removal I did six months prior. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3292.4s)]
*  I had it just sitting in my camera roll. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3294.3599999999997s)]
*  I just decided to post it. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3296.48s)]
*  I think the weather was maybe bad that week. I don't know. And. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3298.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3302.68s)]
*  It's I don't think anything can prepare someone for that. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3304.44s)]
*  How is this the first podcast you've ever done? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3308.48s)]
*  I would imagine people have already asked you. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3310.72s)]
*  I've had requests. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3314.36s)]
*  We had. I don't know. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3316.84s)]
*  You know, you all made it so easy and efficient. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3319.7599999999998s)]
*  It was like, are you interested this day? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3322.0s)]
*  Just making sure you'll be there tomorrow. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3325.24s)]
*  I mean, it was like if bees had a podcast, it was it was great. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3326.64s)]
*  You made it hard to say no. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3330.7599999999998s)]
*  But luckily, we're in Austin. Yes, that's convenient. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3332.08s)]
*  And, you know, for me, I mean, again, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3334.88s)]
*  I like to spend most of my time doing this work. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3337.56s)]
*  And it's seasonal, it's cyclical. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3340.36s)]
*  There's, you know, a time of the year where I can do a lot of it. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3342.6400000000003s)]
*  And there's a time of year where I can't do quite as much. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3345.1200000000003s)]
*  And so sometimes timing doesn't match up. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3348.28s)]
*  I mean, I'm terrible at checking direct messages. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3351.52s)]
*  That's how a lot of requests come through. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3353.88s)]
*  So I won't see him for like six weeks or six months. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3356.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know what that's all about. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3358.08s)]
*  And this video is over 100 million. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3360.48s)]
*  There's multiple videos I saw. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3365.32s)]
*  Oh, my God, that's so insane. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3366.92s)]
*  100 million views. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3370.44s)]
*  Wow, Erica, that's got to be so strange for you. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3373.7200000000003s)]
*  It's incredibly unusual. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3378.52s)]
*  I get recognized on the street. Are you the bee lady? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3380.76s)]
*  You know, I live a pretty quiet life. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3383.76s)]
*  So, I mean, I've got a little piece of dirt and grow some food. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3385.6s)]
*  Got 30 beehives, four dogs, a white wing dove, five chickens, a great husband. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3388.92s)]
*  You know, I don't really go out that much. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3393.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, I'm in beehives most of the time. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3396.52s)]
*  But has it happened? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3399.04s)]
*  It's happened. Yeah. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3400.84s)]
*  I mean, a lot of times. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3401.8s)]
*  And well, and I don't do myself any favors because I pretty much wear the same thing every day. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3403.1600000000003s)]
*  So, I mean, that's the truth. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3407.6400000000003s)]
*  But, you know, people have recognized my truck before when I'm driving. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3409.88s)]
*  So, yeah, it's it's happened. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3414.2400000000002s)]
*  But I love it. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3417.0s)]
*  You know, people will come up and share a bee story or want to tell me that, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3418.0s)]
*  you know, they watch my video and now they're not afraid of bees anymore. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3422.0800000000004s)]
*  Is that the most satisfying thing to you? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3426.2400000000002s)]
*  The fact that you are spreading your love and your your appreciation for these things [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3427.8s)]
*  and and giving people an education and understanding of these incredible creatures. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3432.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, at first, it just terrified me, you know, but now I am really embracing it [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3438.2400000000002s)]
*  and hope that, yeah, I love I love showing people [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3442.6000000000004s)]
*  that you can work alongside these creatures and that. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3447.04s)]
*  They can be very peaceful and it can be a wonderful experience. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3450.96s)]
*  You know, I think that. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3454.92s)]
*  Bees have been misbranded for so long. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3457.52s)]
*  I mean, most people think that bees are aggressive and they're not, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3460.12s)]
*  you know, they can be defensive, but I love showing people a better side of bees [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3464.32s)]
*  and that, you know, it's it's possible to work alongside these colonies without wearing gear. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3468.6400000000003s)]
*  But then there's another side of I get to show people something they've never seen before. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3474.4s)]
*  So, you know, hopefully it's entertaining to watch someone do this work [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3478.8s)]
*  and, you know, be covered in bees or whatnot. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3484.0s)]
*  But they've probably never seen people remove bees before or maybe not like I have. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3486.08s)]
*  And so I love showing people that, you know, something that they've never seen before. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3491.28s)]
*  And hopefully I can educate them. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3495.4s)]
*  And there's something they learn from watching a video. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3496.6s)]
*  A lot of people will say, now I can find the queen in a colony, you know, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3499.88s)]
*  and that's great to hear, too, and just that people can see something [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3503.4s)]
*  that they wouldn't have experienced otherwise if I wasn't doing this. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3506.76s)]
*  And, you know, having my iPhone out. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3510.24s)]
*  One of the problems with becoming successful or becoming viral is that [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3513.32s)]
*  you may get offers now to do things that you might not necessarily want to do, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3518.5600000000004s)]
*  like some sort of a reality television show. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3522.88s)]
*  I'm Erica, the beekeeper. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3525.5600000000004s)]
*  And then they fake things. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3526.96s)]
*  And have you had those things come your way? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3528.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. What's that been like? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3532.76s)]
*  You know, I just try to sort through the offers as carefully as possible. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3536.36s)]
*  And in the beginning, it was really figuring out. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3540.08s)]
*  I mean, what I wanted to do with this opportunity [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3544.24s)]
*  and also just how I want to live my life, you know, I live a pretty quiet life [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3546.92s)]
*  that I love, I'm so happy and I get to do what I love every day. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3550.72s)]
*  And it's on my own time. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3554.92s)]
*  And I don't have a boss and I don't have someone that may want to show. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3556.16s)]
*  You know, a different side of the bees, and that's why they're there. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3561.68s)]
*  And they are just waiting for me to, you know, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3564.72s)]
*  the bees get really defensive one day. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3567.64s)]
*  And, you know, I just just try to, you know, do [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3569.7999999999997s)]
*  what seems like is best for me and the bees and my family. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3574.36s)]
*  If I can help you in that regard, don't get involved with anybody else. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3578.7599999999998s)]
*  Don't let anybody come along. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3583.08s)]
*  Executives and production companies, they're going to mess it up. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3585.4s)]
*  You you already have this immense audience, an incredible amount of success. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3590.44s)]
*  Getting that message out. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3595.36s)]
*  All you have to do is figure out what what anybody would want to do with you [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3597.1600000000003s)]
*  is do some sort of reality show. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3602.2400000000002s)]
*  Just sort of ramp up what you're doing and just figure out a way to monetize it. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3604.0800000000004s)]
*  And you'll be far more successful, completely independent, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3609.0800000000004s)]
*  far more financially successful because you won't have a bunch of parasites [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3611.8s)]
*  sucking off of what you've done because all they're trying to do is capitalize on it. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3615.32s)]
*  And I guarantee one of the things they'll do, because I've done some reality stuff [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3618.96s)]
*  before, one of the things I like to do is they fake scenarios. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3623.64s)]
*  They they'll create a scenario that might mean they might even [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3627.4s)]
*  like want to place a queen somewhere. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3630.44s)]
*  And then you have to like there's a dilemma. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3632.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, this sorority house, you have to help these girls. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3635.8799999999997s)]
*  And they're shrieking. You know what I'm saying? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3638.44s)]
*  Like they'll they'll come up with some bullshit. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3639.92s)]
*  They don't. Yeah, don't don't don't get involved in the machine. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3642.3199999999997s)]
*  The machine is filled with a bunch of some of them are wonderful people. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3646.12s)]
*  But there is a very clear mandate. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3650.92s)]
*  They want to create problems and solutions. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3653.24s)]
*  And that's what every reality show is. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3655.7599999999998s)]
*  And they fake problems and they fake solutions. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3657.3999999999996s)]
*  Don't want to be a part of that. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3660.4399999999996s)]
*  And also, you're going to have a bunch of people telling you how to do it. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3661.6s)]
*  And you're going to get it weirded out by it. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3664.08s)]
*  You're going to hate it. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3666.08s)]
*  If you did do it, I guarantee you we could have a podcast two years from now. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3667.72s)]
*  You know, like you were right. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3670.96s)]
*  It's well, then I probably won't. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3672.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, I think I've made that decision that TV isn't for me. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3675.68s)]
*  Thank you for your perspective. You don't have to. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3679.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, and that's how I felt, too, is that if my goal is really to reach [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3681.92s)]
*  the most amount of people, I mean, just looking at the numbers of what a video [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3685.12s)]
*  that I, you know, just set up a couple of iPhones and do the best I can. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3689.0s)]
*  Editing it and putting it together. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3694.08s)]
*  Hundred and thirty three point five million people. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3695.92s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3699.36s)]
*  Yeah, you cannot get that on television. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3700.6s)]
*  They'll just rob you. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3703.28s)]
*  I wasn't even going to post that one with one hundred and thirty three million. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3704.88s)]
*  And it's my it's my it's the most popular. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3708.12s)]
*  Post it. Well, I'm in my pajamas. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3711.44s)]
*  You're in your pajamas. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3715.6000000000004s)]
*  It was just it was some bees I got from the night before. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3716.6400000000003s)]
*  And they escaped. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3719.6400000000003s)]
*  The queen escaped the clip. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3721.84s)]
*  So sometimes if she's not older or well made, she might be a little bit smaller. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3723.5600000000004s)]
*  And she escaped the clip. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3727.8s)]
*  And it was a large colony of bees. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3729.5600000000004s)]
*  And I showed my mom and she said, oh, you have to post that. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3732.2400000000002s)]
*  And my husband said, oh, no, you got to post that one. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3736.92s)]
*  So I just put it together and posted it. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3738.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, listen to your husband. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3741.48s)]
*  Right. Thirty three million people watched it. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3743.04s)]
*  See, that's a perfect example of why you shouldn't be on television, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3746.44s)]
*  because there's not a place in the world where you're going to get that kind of views [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3749.68s)]
*  other than social media. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3752.2799999999997s)]
*  I thought if the goal was really to teach people, you know, I mean, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3753.64s)]
*  more people will see it this way. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3756.36s)]
*  And I mean, like you said, it's it's kind of my way of doing it. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3758.4s)]
*  And it's when I was going through the process of receiving the offers and, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3762.36s)]
*  you know, deciding not to do a television show at the time, it was [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3766.88s)]
*  I very much felt like nobody, you know, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3772.28s)]
*  I guess if I do it, you'll know that someone had my health and wellness [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3775.96s)]
*  and and that of the bees at the forefront. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3779.36s)]
*  The problem is, you don't know those people, you know, and that was so [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3782.0800000000004s)]
*  an interesting thing that's been part of my story is that [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3785.32s)]
*  this all happened to me during the pandemic. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3789.84s)]
*  So, you know, the height of quarantine is when those videos were getting [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3791.92s)]
*  the 50 million views a day. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3796.84s)]
*  And so I didn't get recognized for a while because nobody was going anywhere. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3798.2000000000003s)]
*  And then I woke up and went out of my house one day. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3802.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, so my life really changed in a weird. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3805.28s)]
*  In a weird time where, you know, I was doing all these interviews and stuff, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3809.8s)]
*  but it was from the study of my house, you know, it was I didn't actually go anywhere. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3814.32s)]
*  And it was all very interesting to go through the process of [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3819.0s)]
*  receiving offers for doing things and working with people, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3824.0400000000004s)]
*  because, yeah, like you said, I mean, I never met these people. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3826.6s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't shake a hand. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3829.96s)]
*  I didn't share a meal. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3831.24s)]
*  And I was shocked that they would hire me without doing that, too. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3832.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, and it just it didn't feel good. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3836.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they're there. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3839.72s)]
*  Some of them are wonderful people. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3841.88s)]
*  A lot of them are wonderful people, but it's just that's their job. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3843.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, you can't blame a hyena for being a hyena. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3846.92s)]
*  That's what they do. Yeah. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3849.64s)]
*  You know, and those people, they find someone like you. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3851.0s)]
*  And all they think of is I can buy a bigger house [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3853.84s)]
*  if I can get Erica show on top. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3857.44s)]
*  I mean, that's literally all they do. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3859.32s)]
*  Well, I met some great people. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3861.1200000000003s)]
*  It felt to me like it was just the process. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3862.36s)]
*  It felt like, you know, after that one video I posted and it was [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3864.2400000000002s)]
*  24 million views in 24 hours. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3867.56s)]
*  I mean, it felt like if you had a production company, you emailed me. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3870.4s)]
*  You know, it just felt like that was what happens to people. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3873.48s)]
*  And I met some great people and it wasn't the people. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3876.4s)]
*  It was just I mean, you know, I didn't know them. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3878.7200000000003s)]
*  And we'll see. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3880.56s)]
*  I mean, never say never. But maybe now. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3881.8s)]
*  Here's the thing is like you can do more on your own and be look. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3885.5600000000004s)]
*  Do you know who Mr. Beast is? Yes. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3889.8s)]
*  Yeah. Great guy. Had him on the podcast for what he's done is amazing. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3891.7200000000003s)]
*  He's done it completely on his own and everything he's done. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3896.2000000000003s)]
*  It's been his decision. Right. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3899.8s)]
*  He has this enormous following. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3901.6000000000004s)]
*  He does all this good. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3903.96s)]
*  He contributes to charities. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3905.6000000000004s)]
*  He runs food banks. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3908.8s)]
*  He funds all of his programs and all of his things through his show. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3910.68s)]
*  He funds all of his new episodes through old episodes. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3915.64s)]
*  He's doing it completely independently. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3920.3199999999997s)]
*  He's so happy and he doesn't deal with any bullshit. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3922.44s)]
*  No one's telling him what to do. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3925.64s)]
*  I see a way where you could do something in your world that's akin to that. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3927.44s)]
*  Like if you're getting this much response, you could do it completely independently. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3933.04s)]
*  It's just it's a matter of if you want to monetize it, if you want to monetize it, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3937.56s)]
*  you want to do it on YouTube and all these different places and have advertising. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3942.36s)]
*  And you can do that. And then you don't have to deal with anybody. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3946.36s)]
*  I can just deal with the bees. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3949.8s)]
*  I mean, that's what I really want to do at the end of the day. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3951.16s)]
*  You know, and that's I mean, he's figured it out. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3953.6s)]
*  That would be the dream. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3956.32s)]
*  And I a lot of my process, I'm restricted because I have to edit [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3957.24s)]
*  or I have to do all these other things that I don't know. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3962.12s)]
*  Doing this all yourself. I'm doing it all myself. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3964.04s)]
*  Yeah. See, all you need to do is hire an editor. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3966.16s)]
*  If you hired an editor and had someone that you trust, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3968.7999999999997s)]
*  that you a friend or someone like that, a family member to come film with you. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3972.7999999999997s)]
*  That's it. That's all you need. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3978.6s)]
*  And then you talk to the camera. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3980.08s)]
*  You talk to that person. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3981.8799999999997s)]
*  You have some fun and you don't have to deal with anybody. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3983.16s)]
*  And then someone edits it. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3986.2s)]
*  They put it up. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3987.56s)]
*  And there is companies that you can get like very similar [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3988.44s)]
*  to what podcast companies do, where they find you advertisers. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3992.7999999999997s)]
*  That when you get one hundred and thirty three million downloads, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=3996.3999999999996s)]
*  it's not difficult to find advertisers, especially something that's so interesting, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4000.24s)]
*  so non controversial, educational, wholesome. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4004.6s)]
*  Everything's cool about it. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4007.56s)]
*  It's really interesting. It's great for the environment. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4008.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think it's very important that people understand, like, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4011.04s)]
*  how important bees are to the ecosystem. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4014.44s)]
*  If all bees died, all people die. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4018.04s)]
*  We have to really understand that, like there is a gigantic system [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4021.12s)]
*  that's in place. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4025.32s)]
*  And I'd like to hear you talk about that because there is a crazy system in place [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4026.2000000000003s)]
*  with like how our food is made, how our plants are pollinized. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4030.52s)]
*  It's all done through these magical little creatures that you're fascinated with. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4034.44s)]
*  It is. And one of the things about sharing my work with the world [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4038.1600000000003s)]
*  is that I've realized that people don't know a lot about bees or how important they are. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4041.6000000000004s)]
*  Bees pollinate one out of every three bites of food we eat. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4047.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's not just, you know, the apple or the almond that you've had today [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4050.36s)]
*  or your cup of coffee. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4055.12s)]
*  It's the beef that you're eating that grazed on alfalfa. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4056.12s)]
*  Bees are responsible for that. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4058.96s)]
*  And, you know, when our bee populations are healthy, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4060.6s)]
*  that's a good sign for our planet because bees are pollinating. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4064.64s)]
*  Over 75 percent of plants need bees for pollination. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4068.88s)]
*  And our world would look so different without honeybees [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4073.52s)]
*  and the over 20,000 species of bees that do so much work for our planet. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4078.64s)]
*  And, you know, there's a lot of other beekeepers out there like me [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4084.44s)]
*  trying to help bees and doing wonderful work for bees. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4088.4s)]
*  But I do feel like, you know, beekeeping is a really noble profession [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4092.04s)]
*  because you're helping these creatures that do so much work for us. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4096.24s)]
*  And, you know, if we want our grocery shelves to look like they do now [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4100.88s)]
*  and to have a diverse diet, we need to treat our bees better [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4105.16s)]
*  and make sure our bee populations are healthy. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4109.84s)]
*  I read something about cell... [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4112.52s)]
*  more than one thing about cell phone signals [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4114.4800000000005s)]
*  interfering with the way bees communicate. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4117.8s)]
*  Do you know what that is? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4120.56s)]
*  I have heard a little bit about that or I've heard about that years ago. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4122.12s)]
*  I haven't heard about that recently. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4125.72s)]
*  And I don't know if there's any merit to that. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4127.16s)]
*  OK. Let's see if we can find something on that. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4130.6s)]
*  Because there was some confusion as to whether or not [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4133.84s)]
*  bees were behaving differently as cell phone use became more widespread [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4137.36s)]
*  and more towers were up. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4145.799999999999s)]
*  And I would just imagine that that signal, whatever that is, that's in the air. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4147.5199999999995s)]
*  Obviously, we can't detect cell phone signals. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4153.36s)]
*  You have to look at your phone to see if you have a signal. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4156.28s)]
*  But whatever they are able to do is obviously so different [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4158.44s)]
*  than the kind of senses that we have. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4163.5599999999995s)]
*  And I think the speculation was that or maybe theory was that there is [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4166.2s)]
*  something about these signals that is interfering with the way bees communicate. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4171.4s)]
*  There could be, but that's certainly not the biggest problem bees face, you know? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4178.88s)]
*  So I don't think that I don't think that's a challenge that bees are facing right now. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4183.08s)]
*  I could be wrong, but, you know, it's not a challenge as a beekeeper. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4189.4s)]
*  I face or I see a problem with my bees and cell phone towers. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4192.24s)]
*  I see a problem with my bees not having enough food and with pesticides [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4195.44s)]
*  and, you know, industrial agriculture. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4199.32s)]
*  So what is industrial agriculture doing to bees? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4201.48s)]
*  It's it's killing our bees. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4205.08s)]
*  It's you know, we're putting these large mono crops. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4207.08s)]
*  These we're putting acres and acres of the same thing that need bees to pollinate. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4210.719999999999s)]
*  For example, almonds, almonds are almost entirely dependent on bees for pollination. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4215.679999999999s)]
*  And so we would have no almonds if we didn't have bees. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4222.679999999999s)]
*  And we're shipping our bees across the country, you know, to pollinate the almond [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4226.759999999999s)]
*  crops in California and then maybe up to the apples in New York. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4231.24s)]
*  And we're putting them in these areas where they only have one food source, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4234.88s)]
*  which isn't healthy for them or for anybody. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4238.16s)]
*  They only have it for a short period of time. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4241.04s)]
*  So, you know, they can only collect food there for a little while. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4243.5199999999995s)]
*  And there may or may not have pesticides sprayed on this food that the bees are collecting. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4247.28s)]
*  But at the end of the day, bees weren't made to be shipped on or [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4251.84s)]
*  be shouldn't be shipped on semi trucks across the country to to pollinate these [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4255.240000000001s)]
*  these places where there's just one one thing living and we're forcing the bees to pollinate. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4260.0s)]
*  You know, that's how they do it. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4264.120000000001s)]
*  They bring in bees. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4266.320000000001s)]
*  You know, the way that most beekeepers earn a living is through commercial [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4268.120000000001s)]
*  pollination services. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4272.4800000000005s)]
*  So we need bees for for food like almonds. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4274.4800000000005s)]
*  And, you know, plants are pollinated one of two ways. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4279.5199999999995s)]
*  They're self pollinating or they're cross pollinating and they need some help [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4283.96s)]
*  to to reproduce and to fertilize. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4287.5199999999995s)]
*  And bees are the best pollinator our planet has. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4290.4s)]
*  So when bees go out and collect food for themselves, you know, they're [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4295.0s)]
*  they're pollinating plants and making sure plants are reproducing. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4299.44s)]
*  And without bees, we wouldn't have, you know, many, many foods. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4303.44s)]
*  But it's not just us. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4307.64s)]
*  It's so many creatures who rely on bees for their food system as well. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4308.72s)]
*  Hmm. So when a beehive, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4314.0s)]
*  when when when some beekeeper brings, like, say there's an almond [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4318.08s)]
*  plantation and they bring these bees in, where are they getting these bees? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4322.6s)]
*  From, you know, commercial beekeepers who keep them most often in the south [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4327.360000000001s)]
*  will overwinter the they will over the winter overwinter the bees in the south [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4331.4800000000005s)]
*  where, you know, like right now, our bees can still go out and forage. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4336.24s)]
*  But in colder climates, it's, you know, the bees will stay in the hive. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4339.4400000000005s)]
*  So I have beekeeping friends in Colorado who don't see their bees for months on end [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4343.92s)]
*  because of it's about 55 degrees Fahrenheit or below. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4347.24s)]
*  The bees won't leave the hive and they're just clustering inside. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4350.4800000000005s)]
*  So, you know, we'll have beekeepers from all around the country [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4353.52s)]
*  ship their bees and do this this pollination circuit. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4356.28s)]
*  And, you know, they'll come from all different areas. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4360.52s)]
*  Texas, California will have some beekeepers. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4362.68s)]
*  Florida is a big place for beekeepers. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4365.4s)]
*  And what are they feeding their bees? [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4368.36s)]
*  Like, how are they keeping their bees alive while they're doing this? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4370.12s)]
*  You know, they're pollinating the almonds. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4372.92s)]
*  So that is food for the once they get once they get there. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4374.5199999999995s)]
*  But when they acquire them in order to ship them, how are they doing that? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4377.36s)]
*  As beekeepers were supplementing food for the bees all the time [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4380.96s)]
*  because there simply isn't enough. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4383.92s)]
*  I mean, that's one of the biggest challenges facing bees is habitat loss. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4385.2s)]
*  And that extends. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4389.639999999999s)]
*  It's not just honeybees, but it's, you know, the over [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4391.0s)]
*  20,000 species of bees that we share this planet with. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4393.84s)]
*  They're all, you know, feeling the effects of not having enough food [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4397.28s)]
*  or not having a diverse enough diet. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4400.96s)]
*  So we will supplement the bees feed with sugar water when needed. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4404.400000000001s)]
*  And it's. Trash. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4409.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's just like feeding your kids McDonald's every day, you know. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4411.360000000001s)]
*  What is the difference between what they get? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4415.16s)]
*  Because pollen, obviously, they get you were talking about the protein. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4417.92s)]
*  Is there a way to give them something artificial [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4421.88s)]
*  or supplement something exogenous that is akin to pollen? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4426.5199999999995s)]
*  There is a pollen substitute. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4431.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's mostly made of like a soy powder. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4433.0s)]
*  But, you know, it's all good for them either. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4435.08s)]
*  It's it's not natural food. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4437.0s)]
*  It's not what the bees are meant to have. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4438.44s)]
*  I mean, these creatures have been around so long. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4441.0s)]
*  It's for us to come along and start feeding them artificial food. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4445.04s)]
*  So is it like human beings where if you give them this artificial stuff, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4449.0s)]
*  you see a decline in lifespan and the decline of overall longevity [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4452.52s)]
*  and robustness of health? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4457.68s)]
*  I don't know if any studies have been done that have exclusively fed bees [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4459.360000000001s)]
*  artificial food, you know, bees need natural food to live. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4462.72s)]
*  We wouldn't want bees to live on exclusively artificial food. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4465.6s)]
*  You shouldn't have bees in that area. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4469.16s)]
*  But people that live like that. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4471.56s)]
*  Yeah. But, you know, we we certainly want to keep the bees [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4472.92s)]
*  as healthy as possible. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4478.64s)]
*  And these these sugar water diets are not what's healthiest for the bees. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4479.64s)]
*  And they know best, you know. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4484.240000000001s)]
*  And so let's let them forage naturally. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4485.4400000000005s)]
*  But they need to have things available to forage. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4488.200000000001s)]
*  So everybody that has a lawn of grass in their front yard [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4490.88s)]
*  with no wildflowers, no native plants, there's, you know, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4495.400000000001s)]
*  a lack of food for native pollinators. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4499.56s)]
*  There's a lack of places for them to find homes [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4502.0s)]
*  and what they need to live their lives. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4504.92s)]
*  So, yeah, there's little things everybody can do to make a difference [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4506.56s)]
*  in the lives of bees. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4511.240000000001s)]
*  And the biggest one is everybody can plant food for bees. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4512.040000000001s)]
*  Anytime you're planting something in your yard or your garden [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4516.240000000001s)]
*  or on your balcony, wherever you live, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4519.320000000001s)]
*  make sure it's something bees can forage from. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4522.120000000001s)]
*  And you will with those things be flowering plants. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4524.240000000001s)]
*  So whatever is local and native to your area is best. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4527.120000000001s)]
*  And when you go to your nursery, you know, you can ask someone for help. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4531.64s)]
*  Or what I like to do is I just look for the plants where the bees are on. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4534.8s)]
*  And so if I see a plant covered in bees, you know, I make sure it's native. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4538.16s)]
*  But then, you know, I know it's probably a plant [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4542.16s)]
*  the bees will forage from and get food from. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4545.12s)]
*  So everybody can plant food for bees. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4547.8s)]
*  And, you know, we just need a greater awareness about it, too, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4550.6s)]
*  on a larger scale, an urban scale, when we're planning our cities [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4554.4800000000005s)]
*  and building our roadways, thinking about [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4557.84s)]
*  the natural forage and food that we're taking away [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4561.4400000000005s)]
*  from the creatures that have lived here longer than us. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4563.96s)]
*  One of the things that I read about bees and honey is that local honey [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4567.08s)]
*  can protect some people from allergies [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4572.12s)]
*  that they may have from the very plants [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4575.4800000000005s)]
*  that these bees are getting their pollen from. Is that true? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4578.92s)]
*  That's completely false. That's false. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4582.8s)]
*  There is no scientific evidence to prove that. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4584.8s)]
*  And the idea. The hippie logic. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4587.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, the idea of it doesn't even hold weight. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4589.84s)]
*  So the idea is that, you know, if you are somehow exposed [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4591.56s)]
*  to the local pollen in your area, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4595.120000000001s)]
*  that you will gain some sort of immune response to it. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4599.64s)]
*  And bees keep pollen and honey separate in their hives. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4603.280000000001s)]
*  So when you eat honey, you're ingesting a very small amount of pollen. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4608.92s)]
*  Also, bees are not foraging from the plants that are causing your allergies. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4614.160000000001s)]
*  So like here in Austin, plants or bees are not foraging from cedar or hay. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4620.08s)]
*  They're or ragweed. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4625.68s)]
*  So there is really no no merit to that. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4627.68s)]
*  Yeah, because that is a hippie thing. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4632.2s)]
*  They say, oh, you need local honey to protect you. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4634.0s)]
*  You know, honey is great. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4636.280000000001s)]
*  It's antibacterial, antimicrobial. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4637.8s)]
*  Eat honey. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4640.16s)]
*  Enjoy honey for all the different wonderful properties that it has [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4641.0s)]
*  and all the wonderful things it can do for you. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4645.2s)]
*  But not because you think it will help with your local seasonal allergies. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4646.88s)]
*  It will not. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4651.64s)]
*  Do you know that it's how they used to use it to preserve psychedelic mushrooms? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4652.64s)]
*  I did not know that. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4656.56s)]
*  Yeah, they used to preserve psychedelic mushrooms and honey [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4657.64s)]
*  because it keeps them from rotting. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4660.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. And then they went on to create mead with honey. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4662.56s)]
*  This is like in psychedelic lore when they're trying to figure out [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4667.12s)]
*  like why certain cultures moved from a psychedelic culture [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4671.72s)]
*  to an alcohol based culture for intoxicants. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4675.96s)]
*  And they think that it stemmed from initially that they started [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4679.12s)]
*  to preserve mushrooms in particular in honey. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4682.92s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4686.6s)]
*  And then preserving them in honey is obviously a very effective way to preserve things. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4687.56s)]
*  And then they went from that to creating mead with honey, which is alcohol based. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4691.84s)]
*  And then the alcohol changed the way that people behaved and changed the culture. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4696.4s)]
*  Wow. And, you know, lowered inhibitions, made people more aggressive, [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4700.56s)]
*  changed like less thoughtful, less sense of community. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4703.88s)]
*  Do you know if the process of the mushrooms in the honey was part of discovering mead? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4707.56s)]
*  Was it because they left it for so long and it fermented? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4712.12s)]
*  And I don't believe so. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4714.8s)]
*  It was. I don't believe so. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4716.0s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know much about me and myself. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4717.96s)]
*  Mead is weird. Yeah. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4720.28s)]
*  It's a weird kind of beer like thing. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4721.84s)]
*  My friend Maynard, he has a winery. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4723.8s)]
*  He has a he owns Vineyard's, you know, tool, the band tool. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4726.6s)]
*  My friend Maynard's the lead band tool. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4730.52s)]
*  He owns Caduceus Vineyards. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4732.5599999999995s)]
*  And he's a real weirdo because he does a lot of different things really well. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4735.12s)]
*  And one of the things that he does really well is he makes wine and he makes mead [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4739.44s)]
*  and he makes different, you know, kind of sparkling wines and stuff. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4742.76s)]
*  But they make, you know, alcohol based out of honey. Sure. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4746.5599999999995s)]
*  Have you had that? I have. I have had it before. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4751.8s)]
*  Do you like it? I do like it. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4753.92s)]
*  Do you like it just because it's honey? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4755.8s)]
*  Like if you didn't know it was honey, would you like it? [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4757.24s)]
*  I'm definitely pro honey, you know? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4758.8s)]
*  But I'll say one thing that I am curious to try. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4761.32s)]
*  Have you ever heard of Mad Honey? Yes. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4763.36s)]
*  I ordered some. No. Yeah. Yeah. I bought it online. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4765.96s)]
*  You want it? Is it here? No. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4769.639999999999s)]
*  No. See, you get excited. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4771.08s)]
*  No, I haven't even tried it. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4773.5599999999995s)]
*  I just got it like a little while ago. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4775.36s)]
*  It's at my house. Yeah. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4777.32s)]
*  Where did you buy it on Amazon? [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4778.44s)]
*  Where did might be bullshit, though. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4779.8s)]
*  Well, you'll have to. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4781.48s)]
*  I mean, I'm so curious to find out what is your source, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4782.28s)]
*  because I know it comes from, I think, Turkey and Nepal. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4784.44s)]
*  Or I don't know if it comes from other places. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4787.16s)]
*  We've covered it on the podcast. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4788.96s)]
*  Oh, you have? OK. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4790.08s)]
*  Because it's such a wild way of extracting it, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4791.04s)]
*  the way these guys have to get it off the side. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4793.32s)]
*  Let's pull that up so people can see it. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4796.16s)]
*  Oh, by the way, did you find anything about cell phones? [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4798.08s)]
*  There are, it seems like two studies. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4800.64s)]
*  This comes from 2009, 2011. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4803.64s)]
*  In the 2011 one, I'll put up on the screen. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4806.5199999999995s)]
*  This guy put two cell phones in a beehive [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4809.84s)]
*  and then studied them with like what they were doing after a couple of minutes. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4812.68s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4816.16s)]
*  But most of what I got to the abstract [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4817.32s)]
*  and the conclusion of all these studies is like they just need to do more [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4819.52s)]
*  research to find out exactly what it's doing. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4821.84s)]
*  They got to that. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4823.56s)]
*  It could be affecting electromagnetic waves and systems around the bees. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4824.64s)]
*  And that could be what they're using to communicate. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4829.32s)]
*  But it didn't. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4832.04s)]
*  This is a person putting cell phones inside a beehive. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4833.28s)]
*  Correct. That's what I'm saying. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4836.4s)]
*  These studies only come from like over 10 years ago. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4837.24s)]
*  The thing about that is like, so like this, it says in this experience, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4840.48s)]
*  far of place two cell phones inside a beehive and set up equipment [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4844.32s)]
*  to record the sounds of the bees when the phones were off [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4848.64s)]
*  in standby mode and active in a phone call. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4851.599999999999s)]
*  After the phones had been on for about 20 to 40 minutes, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4854.68s)]
*  the bees began to make a high pitched squeaking sound known as piping. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4857.5599999999995s)]
*  This sound usually is a sound is usually a single a signal. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4862.32s)]
*  It says single, but I think they meant signal made by the bees [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4867.16s)]
*  to announce swarming or that the hive is in danger. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4870.64s)]
*  However, even after the cell phone signals running for 20 hours [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4874.12s)]
*  and the piping sounds continuing, the bees did not swarm. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4878.64s)]
*  Within only two minutes of the cell phones being turned off, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4882.88s)]
*  the bees calmed down to their original state. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4886.2s)]
*  But that seems like you're introducing a lot of other things [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4889.24s)]
*  other than just a cell phone signal. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4892.5599999999995s)]
*  You're introducing electronics, heat. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4894.32s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff going on. Sound vibration, right? [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4896.5599999999995s)]
*  I'd have a lot of questions about that. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4900.16s)]
*  I mean, I don't I don't know if that tells us to go back to that article, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4902.44s)]
*  Jamie, to the very top of it, because it said this is the title of the articles, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4906.12s)]
*  which is what's interesting to me. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4910.48s)]
*  It says it might be contributing to honeybee population decline. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4911.719999999999s)]
*  So that's what they call a. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4916.4s)]
*  Shit, I lost it. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4920.12s)]
*  I think this and when we talk about honeybee population [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4922.719999999999s)]
*  decline to begin with, we need to know that, you know, [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4925.96s)]
*  why we lose colonies every year and the populations aren't healthy. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4928.639999999999s)]
*  Beekeepers are replacing those colonies. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4931.68s)]
*  So, you know, the populations are stable, even though hive loss rates. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4933.72s)]
*  Go back to that, Jamie, what I was just going to point to what you just had. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4937.92s)]
*  Right here, it says 2009, Dr. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4941.280000000001s)]
*  Sane, you Dean had found that EMR from mobile towers [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4943.320000000001s)]
*  was responsible for the killing of bees, which is substantiated [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4948.52s)]
*  by a Swiss scientist, Daniel Favre in 2011. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4951.96s)]
*  Rock bees are the major pollinating agents on their migratory roots [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4955.56s)]
*  and are sensitive to EMR, which would affect their navigational skills. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4961.24s)]
*  Physiology changes in their antennae. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4965.36s)]
*  Senzilla, Sencia, how do you say that? [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4968.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you know? I don't. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4972.4800000000005s)]
*  You're a big lady. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4974.0s)]
*  They might have made that word up. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4975.88s)]
*  They might have made it up. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4977.4800000000005s)]
*  Brain proteome, neurotransmission and development. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4978.56s)]
*  The orientation of honeybees is connected to the Earth's magnetic field. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4982.12s)]
*  And for this, they possess localized particles [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4986.76s)]
*  called called magnetites. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4989.68s)]
*  If EMR frequency from towers increases, [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4992.360000000001s)]
*  the magnetite particles won't be able to detect the Earth's magnetic fields [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=4996.96s)]
*  and disrupt their navigational skills, according to Dr. Sane, you Dean. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5001.76s)]
*  So that previous study you read about the [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5006.68s)]
*  the cell phones in the hive was what this this guy did. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5009.360000000001s)]
*  That's that far. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5012.52s)]
*  This is that substantiates that, but that's not exactly what you just read. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5013.72s)]
*  So that's right. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5017.36s)]
*  Like they're drawing conclusions a little bit. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5018.12s)]
*  Maybe they're just trying to scare people. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5021.0s)]
*  I feel like that's what they're trying to do. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5022.599999999999s)]
*  Hmm. So that's fascinating, though, that they use the Earth's magnetic poles [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5024.88s)]
*  to navigate. Yeah. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5028.4s)]
*  Do we understand how they do that? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5030.36s)]
*  They also I mean, they use the orientation of the sun with where their hive [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5031.599999999999s)]
*  is located to tell the other bees where to go. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5035.0s)]
*  So, you know, how do they do that? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5037.759999999999s)]
*  Well, they one of the ways they communicate, you know, in addition to the pheromones [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5040.5599999999995s)]
*  and through touching each other or piping, vocalizing is [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5046.320000000001s)]
*  through dancing, through movement. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5052.56s)]
*  So we call it the waggle dance. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5054.200000000001s)]
*  And every morning, some scout bees will fly out of the hive [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5056.320000000001s)]
*  and find the best places for the bees to forage from. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5060.4400000000005s)]
*  Or in some cases, if they need a new place to live, they'll find a new nest site. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5064.64s)]
*  So maybe a new, you know, backyard shed or compost bin or whatever. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5069.400000000001s)]
*  And the scout bees will come back to the hive [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5073.679999999999s)]
*  and announce what they've found to the colony through a waggle dance. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5077.2s)]
*  It's a series of movements. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5081.12s)]
*  It kind of looks like a figure eight pattern. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5082.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's the bee waggling her abdomen up in the air and doing this dance [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5085.28s)]
*  and telling the other bees. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5089.36s)]
*  There's a waggle dance. Yeah, there we go. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5091.32s)]
*  So she's telling. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5092.92s)]
*  Well, there's usually other bees around her, but she'll tell the other bees [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5094.44s)]
*  where to go based on the. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5099.12s)]
*  Direction or the position of the sun. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5103.04s)]
*  She tells her nest mates that the food is 270 degrees [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5106.44s)]
*  or to the left of the sun on the horizon. Whoa. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5109.08s)]
*  Yes. So you'll see the other bees around her and they are obviously, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5113.5599999999995s)]
*  you know, getting her messages, reading the dance. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5118.5599999999995s)]
*  And if she is announcing a place to live for a place for the colonies to move, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5120.88s)]
*  then what will happen is other bees will go and investigate that nest site [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5128.08s)]
*  and come back to the colony. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5133.2s)]
*  And the more bees that choose the nest site, the more popular it is. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5136.280000000001s)]
*  And essentially, you know, the bees are all voting together on where [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5140.52s)]
*  where to move to. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5144.8s)]
*  So what they move the entire colony, including the queen. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5146.12s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's a swarm. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5149.0s)]
*  So when, you know, most of the colony with the queen [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5150.2s)]
*  leaves the hive and looks for a new place to live, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5153.4400000000005s)]
*  that's that's a swarm. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5156.8s)]
*  And that's, you know, a popular reason that they would do the waggle dances [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5158.04s)]
*  to announce a new nest site for the other bees to go and investigate [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5161.56s)]
*  and come back to the hive and announce where what they found the colony. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5165.52s)]
*  Would they start a separate colony with a new queen [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5170.52s)]
*  or would they only move the queen? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5174.8s)]
*  Well, what happens is most of the bees will take the queen [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5176.88s)]
*  and look for a new place to live. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5181.4800000000005s)]
*  And hopefully they will find a new place and be successful and, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5183.0s)]
*  you know, go on and create more baby bees and have a great healthy colony [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5186.32s)]
*  in their new nest site. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5190.4800000000005s)]
*  Meanwhile, back in the old hive, they have left behind food. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5192.0s)]
*  They have left behind baby bees. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5196.360000000001s)]
*  They have left behind be eggs in enough nurse bees to care for these baby [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5198.52s)]
*  bees and be eggs so that they can create another queen. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5203.360000000001s)]
*  So if they have the female, you know, a female bee egg, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5208.24s)]
*  they can turn that into a queen bee. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5212.4400000000005s)]
*  And so the swarming process is the natural reproduction process for the colony. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5214.64s)]
*  You know, when you see me remove bees from somewhere, that's just in many cases [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5219.72s)]
*  the natural way we get more bee colonies into the world. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5224.160000000001s)]
*  So, you know, if we have one bee colony and we need to, that's how it happens. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5228.12s)]
*  So is that dependent upon the resources that are available in the area? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5232.84s)]
*  Well, they'll go out and find a new spot and go, hey, we found a good spot [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5236.52s)]
*  and the other bees will stay there and then they'll create a new queen [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5240.240000000001s)]
*  and then just keep expanding their numbers that way. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5243.08s)]
*  They certainly make sure they have enough resources, you know, in the area. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5246.04s)]
*  And they want to find a nesting site, a hive location [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5249.64s)]
*  that has resources around for them to build. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5253.16s)]
*  But there are things that they look for. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5255.5599999999995s)]
*  They actually have, you know, pretty more stringent requirements [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5258.28s)]
*  than we thought for building these sites, which is or for choosing a site [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5261.88s)]
*  to build a new hive, which is why I do be removals from the same places [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5266.24s)]
*  over and over again, compost bins, water meter boxes. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5270.44s)]
*  Things like that. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5273.24s)]
*  The bees will look for, you know, an area that's climate controlled [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5274.68s)]
*  and the right amount of space. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5278.16s)]
*  They need a certain amount of space to fit all the bees in there, of course, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5281.32s)]
*  but they need space to expand and build the comb and grow. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5284.6s)]
*  They like a small entrance that they can easily defend. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5289.12s)]
*  It's a we've learned that it's about an inch, inch and a half big, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5291.88s)]
*  I think, is their preferred entrance size. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5296.5199999999995s)]
*  There's a wonderful professor of biology, Dr. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5298.88s)]
*  Thomas Seeley, who's done. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5301.8s)]
*  An immense and incredible amount of work [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5304.56s)]
*  regarding how bees choose their nest sites, and so there are things [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5307.84s)]
*  that are better for the colony as a whole, and, you know, [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5313.320000000001s)]
*  they'll all decide on that together and choose and select the new nest site [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5317.4400000000005s)]
*  as a whole unit versus the individual bees. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5322.2s)]
*  You know, everybody gets a say in the colony. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5326.8s)]
*  Hmm. Fascinating. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5329.2s)]
*  So let's take a look at this because you brought one. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5330.76s)]
*  Oh, bring it up there. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5334.24s)]
*  You put it up on the table. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5335.76s)]
*  I would be happy to. Please do. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5336.84s)]
*  May I move around? Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5339.8s)]
*  Yeah. You can take your headphones off and make it easier while you're doing this. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5342.0s)]
*  And that is that honey that is from that particular group, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5348.6s)]
*  the honey that you have there. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5352.4800000000005s)]
*  What is this? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5355.04s)]
*  That's honey from another colony. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5356.88s)]
*  And that's really just. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5361.12s)]
*  For them to have a little bit of food, they have food in this hive, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5365.28s)]
*  but that's just a nice kind of, you know, there is this honey, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5368.719999999999s)]
*  like a slow drip or something. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5373.76s)]
*  Can I lift this up? [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5375.44s)]
*  Or would they be's come out? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5377.12s)]
*  You will see bees when you lift that up, but you are more than welcome to lift it up. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5379.679999999999s)]
*  And do you see them in there? [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5383.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, there's a net. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5385.599999999999s)]
*  You can even put your finger there. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5386.92s)]
*  And those are their little proboscis. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5389.2s)]
*  Hi, guys. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5391.36s)]
*  Or girls. Excuse me. Sorry. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5392.44s)]
*  Sorry. And so you have little dots, little holes here, folks. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5394.48s)]
*  You can see that little holes in the bottom of this honey jar. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5398.08s)]
*  So it's like a slow drip to them. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5400.96s)]
*  Wow. And yeah, the sound they're making so fast. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5403.96s)]
*  Sounds incredible. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5407.44s)]
*  Is that OK? [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5408.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5413.84s)]
*  No, that's great. Yeah, it's kind of blocking me, but. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5414.72s)]
*  It's OK. Well, anyways. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5420.4s)]
*  I can see it over this way. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5423.88s)]
*  Oh, are you? OK, cool. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5426.56s)]
*  So there is a queen in there and, you know, all this was a swarm, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5428.4800000000005s)]
*  so they didn't have any anything with them. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5432.64s)]
*  So this is all stuff from another hive that I donated to them. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5434.68s)]
*  But these are all female bees. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5438.92s)]
*  I haven't seen a single male bee in here. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5440.12s)]
*  And if I open this door, Jamie will panic and run out of the studio. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5442.56s)]
*  You would. You haven't learned from her what she said. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5446.56s)]
*  I was attacked when I was a younger child. Oh, my goodness. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5450.200000000001s)]
*  Were you attacked by bees or hornets? I don't know. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5453.84s)]
*  It was inside of a grocery store and I didn't see it coming. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5456.400000000001s)]
*  A grocery store inside of a grocery store. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5459.360000000001s)]
*  I was in the frozen food section and something flew up my shirt. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5461.72s)]
*  Next thing I knew, I was swollen. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5464.28s)]
*  So that's probably hornets, right? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5466.6s)]
*  I got I got lit up by hornets in Utah this September. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5469.32s)]
*  So the thing about honeybees is once they sting you, they will die. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5473.16s)]
*  The stinger is attached to their abdominal cavity and it'll rip out of them [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5476.6s)]
*  and they'll die shortly after. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5480.28s)]
*  But, you know, a lot of hornets and wasps, well, all they won't. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5482.24s)]
*  They can sting you multiple times without dying, which also the queen can. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5486.2s)]
*  She is the only bee that well, the male drone bees don't have a stinger. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5489.48s)]
*  The female worker bees, their stinger is barbed, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5493.84s)]
*  which makes it stick into your skin and rip out. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5496.240000000001s)]
*  They can sting other bees and it won't rip out and they won't die. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5500.240000000001s)]
*  But the queen bee, her stinger is not barbed. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5503.360000000001s)]
*  So you could be stung multiple times by a queen in theory. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5505.72s)]
*  But the queens rarely have an occasion. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5509.320000000001s)]
*  Is that because the queen is ready to fight to the death? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5512.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5516.8s)]
*  Pull that out that way. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5518.76s)]
*  Wow, that's so cool. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5521.360000000001s)]
*  And so there's, you know, on this side, we have a lot of. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5523.36s)]
*  And you can feel them, too. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5527.32s)]
*  I mean, you can just feel their warmth. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5528.5599999999995s)]
*  So they always try to keep their hive at around ninety five degrees. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5529.799999999999s)]
*  And that's just body temperature. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5533.5199999999995s)]
*  That's just that's just their body heat. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5534.84s)]
*  Up here, we have a bunch of honey that's, you know, capped honey. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5537.639999999999s)]
*  That's going to be their food source during the winter. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5541.639999999999s)]
*  And then over here, there's a lot of pollen. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5543.719999999999s)]
*  It may be hard to see, but these holes, could they get out of there if they want to? [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5546.44s)]
*  Well, it's screened, so they cannot. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5551.4s)]
*  But I mean, you could they react to carbon dioxide. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5553.16s)]
*  So earlier I was trying to show the gentleman the queen and I, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5556.16s)]
*  you know, blew in in the hole a little bit so that they could kind of move around. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5560.44s)]
*  And it disrupts them a little bit. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5565.0s)]
*  And and we saw her down here where there's brood. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5567.16s)]
*  This is where the baby bees are. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5571.5599999999995s)]
*  So it's more likely that she would be down here. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5573.0s)]
*  But I also selected this piece of comb to bring out of out of this hive, [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5576.0s)]
*  because it's not quite fully built all the way across. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5580.64s)]
*  And if you notice this side, the bees are just hanging on the comb [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5586.0s)]
*  and they're on top of each other and they're kind of making this little living chain of bees. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5589.64s)]
*  Their little legs are all linked together, and that's how they build comb. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5594.320000000001s)]
*  So you're seeing them build more of this beeswax comb. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5598.12s)]
*  I don't know if you can see that. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5601.04s)]
*  Yes. These there. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5602.08s)]
*  I mean, if you shake the hive, you can see it move. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5602.92s)]
*  You see? Yes. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5605.68s)]
*  How long is the process to make? [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5607.6s)]
*  How much comb can they make in a day? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5609.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know how much comb it would depend on the size of the colony. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5612.360000000001s)]
*  But, you know, every bee or the female worker bees have these little wax glands [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5616.160000000001s)]
*  on the underside of their abdomen. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5621.120000000001s)]
*  They have eight of these glands and the wax comes out, you know, I mean, like we do, [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5622.6s)]
*  like we produce wax, but they don't have ears. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5627.160000000001s)]
*  Of course, they have these glands on their on their stomach. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5628.96s)]
*  And it'll come off in these sheets and they'll chew it up and form it [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5631.68s)]
*  in into the beehive structure. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5636.2s)]
*  Wow. One of the things that I saw that was really wild was these [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5637.96s)]
*  hornets that would come and kill honeybees. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5643.72s)]
*  They swarm in and just a few enormous hornets. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5648.36s)]
*  They would chop off the heads of these honeybees. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5652.16s)]
*  And to stop that, the honeybees swarmed the hornets [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5655.76s)]
*  and just beat their wings on them and heated them up until they died of overheating. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5659.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes, they will. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5664.16s)]
*  That's actually how the bees will or can kill a queen in beekeeping. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5665.5199999999995s)]
*  We refer to it as a cuddle death because it sort of looks like, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5672.5199999999995s)]
*  you know, a bunch of bees, just a ball of bees balling all over the hornet [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5676.44s)]
*  or in some cases, the queen. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5680.599999999999s)]
*  And in that case, that's what they're doing is they're overheating it to death. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5682.84s)]
*  And that's their way of taking care of these, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5687.32s)]
*  you know, northern giant hornets that made the news last year a lot. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5690.12s)]
*  Murder hornets, right? That's what they're calling them. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5695.0s)]
*  But yes. And they were, you know, it has it plays into the fear of bees. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5697.04s)]
*  That media. There it is right there. Yes. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5703.4800000000005s)]
*  So why why are these hornets killing these honeybees? [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5706.0s)]
*  Look how they just jump on top of that. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5709.84s)]
*  I mean, that is incredible. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5712.0s)]
*  Yeah. We see that on the camera. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5713.68s)]
*  Is it? Yeah. OK. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5715.56s)]
*  So they just know what's going on. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5717.76s)]
*  OK. And so they know what's going on and they just jump all over it. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5720.52s)]
*  So this is a common thing that these large hornets will do this, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5724.88s)]
*  or they just instinctively know that they can heat them up like that. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5728.52s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5732.64s)]
*  And so by being on top of them, how long does it take for them to overheat them? [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5734.84s)]
*  I wouldn't know. But this is a hornet that we well, we hopefully don't have in the US. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5739.08s)]
*  There's been no sightings of of these these hornets this year. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5743.12s)]
*  So I've I've never seen anything like that. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5749.4s)]
*  Why? Why do hornets kill bees? [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5752.24s)]
*  They are probably, you know, they're a predator of the bees. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5755.08s)]
*  They will eat the bees or go after the honey or the pollen. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5757.72s)]
*  And, you know, we we have to keep in mind these hornets are native [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5761.599999999999s)]
*  to an area of the world where people keep bees and [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5765.599999999999s)]
*  beekeepers have learned to live alongside these hornets and have [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5770.16s)]
*  have their own management techniques. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5774.12s)]
*  But as we can see, the bees have their own management techniques [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5776.04s)]
*  take care of these hornets, too. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5779.28s)]
*  So it's fascinating because they're totally different things, bees and hornets. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5780.92s)]
*  But they're so similarly shaped. Yes. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5784.32s)]
*  That we put them in the same category. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5787.24s)]
*  But they're very different. They're very different. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5789.4s)]
*  But, you know, people. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5791.719999999999s)]
*  People get them confused all the time. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5793.84s)]
*  It's just, you know, we don't. Yeah. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5795.4s)]
*  People not knowing. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5796.72s)]
*  And I get a lot of calls that turn out to be hornets or wasps. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5797.64s)]
*  And, you know, I try to do my best beforehand to gauge, like, [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5801.8s)]
*  make sure that I'm showing up for bees. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5805.96s)]
*  But people just don't know the difference a lot. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5808.400000000001s)]
*  When they are hornets, what's the protocol? [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5810.72s)]
*  Like, what do you do? You just murder them? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5813.0s)]
*  No, I'm not an exterminator. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5814.88s)]
*  That's not what I do. I hate hornets. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5817.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, they're not so bad. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5819.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, you want me to move this down now? [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5822.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I got it. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5824.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5826.68s)]
*  Well, I've just been stung by them so many times. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5829.16s)]
*  When you in Utah, where I go in September, [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5832.0s)]
*  there's a ton of them up there. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5836.52s)]
*  And you can just get too close to their hive [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5838.8s)]
*  and they decide to light you up. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5841.200000000001s)]
*  Like, they're not nice at all. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5843.04s)]
*  They're not like your cute little honeybees. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5844.4800000000005s)]
*  Allowing you to touch them. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5847.0s)]
*  And the thing is, like, once one of them stings you, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5848.320000000001s)]
*  apparently they release a pheromone [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5850.68s)]
*  that makes all of them swarm toward you. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5852.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's the same way with bees. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5854.96s)]
*  It's a chemical marker. It's a pheromone, yep. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5856.84s)]
*  That, you know, you're marked as a threat to the colony [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5859.28s)]
*  and all the other bees need to go after you. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5863.16s)]
*  You know, in Texas, here a lot, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5867.08s)]
*  we have, I guess, a lot of paper wasps. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5868.72s)]
*  Everybody has paper wasps under their porch. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5870.56s)]
*  Look at all these bees, like, [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5872.84s)]
*  riding them and dragging them to the ground. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5873.88s)]
*  It's so fascinating. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5876.24s)]
*  I mean, that's a remarkable creature, that hornet. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5877.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely remarkable. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5880.84s)]
*  It's like a monster, like a giant monster [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5882.28s)]
*  that comes to chop your mom's head off, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5885.599999999999s)]
*  because they're just chopping everyone's head off. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5887.599999999999s)]
*  It's horrible. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5889.32s)]
*  I mean, they go in there and they can kill thousands. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5890.88s)]
*  There was a swarm of hornets in this one documentary [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5893.679999999999s)]
*  I watched that wiped out an entire colony of bees. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5896.16s)]
*  They just swarmed in and cut all their heads off. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5898.92s)]
*  And so I guess they're eating them. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5902.36s)]
*  This is so hard to watch. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5904.28s)]
*  It's like, these are your people. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5906.08s)]
*  Look, see, they're going and they're eating the babies. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5907.599999999999s)]
*  Is this difficult for you? [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5910.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's not enjoyable. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5913.08s)]
*  You're like, Jamie, shut it off. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5914.48s)]
*  I just... [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5917.0s)]
*  You feel very connected to this. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5918.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean... [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5919.5599999999995s)]
*  That'd be a real problem if those things became invasive. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5920.5599999999995s)]
*  It... I mean, it could be. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5922.8s)]
*  Yeah, if they came over here. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5924.639999999999s)]
*  Well, they have been found here. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5926.0s)]
*  Colonies have been found here. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5928.16s)]
*  The nest, as I understand it, have been completely eradicated. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5929.32s)]
*  And we don't even know if, you know, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5931.84s)]
*  they could establish themselves here. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5933.92s)]
*  Climate-wise? [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5936.36s)]
*  Climate-wise. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5937.08s)]
*  I don't think any new nests were found in 2022. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5938.28s)]
*  It was in the Pacific Northwest, correct? [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5942.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5944.08s)]
*  Why there? [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5945.08s)]
*  Has it become shipping containers? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5946.24s)]
*  I believe they were from shipping containers, [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5948.2s)]
*  but also climate. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5950.4s)]
*  So that is one place where these hornets could live and reproduce. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5951.76s)]
*  And it was... [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5958.04s)]
*  I mean... [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5959.04s)]
*  I was on the news here in Texas [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5960.56s)]
*  because the news here in Texas was covering these hornets. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5962.08s)]
*  The amount of press that they got was just incredible. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5966.12s)]
*  It was... I mean, it was just all about the fear of these hornets coming over. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5971.24s)]
*  But, you know, it's similar to what the fear around Africanized bees is from. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5976.08s)]
*  Yeah, the killer bees. Killer. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5979.88s)]
*  I mean, that was also media-induced fear, you know, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5981.5199999999995s)]
*  as we saw the progression of these bees [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5985.04s)]
*  and saw them get established in South America and Central America. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5988.92s)]
*  And you could track their progression. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5993.32s)]
*  And we knew that they would eventually make their way into the US. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5995.08s)]
*  And so I think, you know, during that time, [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=5998.44s)]
*  the media just amplified the fear, you know, the fear factor. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6000.04s)]
*  What does this mean, Jamie? [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6006.64s)]
*  They eat the hornets? [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6008.32s)]
*  They fry the hornets up to eat them and put them in sake. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6010.12s)]
*  What? [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6014.96s)]
*  Dr. Kawahara said that it's just treated like a regular insect. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6015.88s)]
*  In the United States, on the other hand, he continued, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6020.72s)]
*  All this media surrounds this organism because of what it does [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6022.96s)]
*  and because of the name. It's a craze. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6027.04s)]
*  Interesting. Of course. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6029.52s)]
*  But that's what we do. We fuck everything up. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6031.24s)]
*  Yeah, I would say, well said, sir. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6032.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6034.32s)]
*  Or ma'am. I'm sorry. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6035.08s)]
*  Whoever it is. They. They them. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6036.12s)]
*  So what... killer bees. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6038.88s)]
*  What's the difference between the Africanized killer bees? [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6040.92s)]
*  So the Africanized bees... I won't use that word, but... [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6043.76s)]
*  It's not a bee? [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6048.28s)]
*  Well, no, I won't use the term killer bees. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6049.16s)]
*  I'll try to not use that. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6051.32s)]
*  Why do they use that term? It's just the same thing as murder hornet? [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6052.92s)]
*  It's the same thing as murder hornets. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6055.32s)]
*  But, you know, the Africanized bee, that is a hybrid bee [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6057.44s)]
*  of our Western honeybee that we have here [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6063.08s)]
*  and a bee from Africa that a biologist brought to Brazil [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6068.32s)]
*  to breed a better bee. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6074.24s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6076.04s)]
*  So a biologist in the 1950s brought over this subspecies of bee [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6076.92s)]
*  to breed with the European honeybees, [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6084.4s)]
*  the Western honeybees that they had in Brazil, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6088.0s)]
*  which were not native to Brazil. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6091.12s)]
*  Bees are not native to the United States, you know. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6093.12s)]
*  They're not? They're not. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6095.68s)]
*  No, they were brought over by the colonists because we needed them. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6097.0s)]
*  So honeybees are not native to the United States. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6100.72s)]
*  So what pollinated plants before honeybees came here? [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6103.64s)]
*  Here in the U.S. or here in the sense of here? [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6108.6s)]
*  Because bees evolved from wasps, actually. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6111.200000000001s)]
*  As wasps became vegetarian and figured out that pollen was a good food source, [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6115.200000000001s)]
*  bees evolved from these predatory wasps. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6121.8s)]
*  So wasps went vegan and they became this much more peaceful creature, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6124.400000000001s)]
*  which is the honeybee. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6130.280000000001s)]
*  How long did that take? [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6132.16s)]
*  I don't know how long it took. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6133.599999999999s)]
*  You know, this happened well before we were here, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6135.24s)]
*  about 100, 120 million years ago, I think. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6138.36s)]
*  So, you know, there's when I, I mean, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6141.48s)]
*  and that's one of the things I love most about beekeeping [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6144.4s)]
*  is when I go into this hive, I'm part of this collective consciousness [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6146.48s)]
*  that knows so much more than I do. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6150.2s)]
*  So bees were brought over to North America. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6153.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6157.2s)]
*  And South America. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6158.2s)]
*  What pollinated plants before the bees? [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6161.0s)]
*  Other bees. These are just honeybees we're talking about. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6163.28s)]
*  So there's over 20,000 species of bees. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6165.88s)]
*  But also we have, I mean, we have other bees, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6169.04s)]
*  but we have other pollinators as well. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6171.12s)]
*  So we have butterflies, bats, birds. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6172.6s)]
*  Whoa, look at these creeps. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6174.68s)]
*  Wow. Look at that crazy looking blue bead. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6176.96s)]
*  What's that thing off of its abdomen? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6179.04s)]
*  I would guess that's an orchid bee. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6181.0s)]
*  Oh, there it is. Wow. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6183.56s)]
*  South and Mesoamerica. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6186.36s)]
*  Look at that creepy little one to the left. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6188.2s)]
*  The ground nesting bee. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6190.48s)]
*  It looks like a ground nesting squirrel. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6192.959999999999s)]
*  Creepy little squirrels. Wow. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6195.5199999999995s)]
*  Look at that. How do you say that? Crepuscular? [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6198.679999999999s)]
*  Crepuscular bee from the southwestern US. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6201.719999999999s)]
*  So those bees were the bees that used to, [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6205.5599999999995s)]
*  but they didn't create honey? [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6208.24s)]
*  So most bees do not create honey, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6210.16s)]
*  which is one of the reasons that we have kept the honeybee, right? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6214.12s)]
*  Because they create a massive amount of honey, [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6218.12s)]
*  and that's because they're in a larger colony. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6220.84s)]
*  So a lot of bees are solitary bees, [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6224.24s)]
*  whereas honeybees are what we call social bees. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6228.44s)]
*  So they live in these giant colonies that we as humans [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6231.04s)]
*  can move around and manipulate and put, you know, [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6234.32s)]
*  in our fields to pollinate our crops [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6237.72s)]
*  and also produce a lot of honey. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6240.36s)]
*  So these other bees would just buy them, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6243.44s)]
*  they were like lone wolf bees? [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6245.96s)]
*  They're solitary bees, that's right. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6247.68s)]
*  How they're pollinating. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6249.08s)]
*  So a lot of them, and a lot of them are even better pollinators [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6250.08s)]
*  than honeybees for some plants because they're specialty bees. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6254.92s)]
*  So they'll specialize in one plant, [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6259.400000000001s)]
*  and so it creates this relationship [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6261.88s)]
*  where we have some plants that rely on some of these bees, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6263.68s)]
*  where as honeybees are more generalist, [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6267.320000000001s)]
*  I would say, and do a lot of plants. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6270.88s)]
*  So, you know, that's why when we talk about the bee populations, [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6273.36s)]
*  it's, you know, we have the honeybees [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6279.2s)]
*  that are managed by humans, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6281.12s)]
*  and then we have these other bee populations [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6283.16s)]
*  which are not closely managed by humans, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6285.36s)]
*  and humans are not replenishing or really even thinking about, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6288.679999999999s)]
*  but they do so much work for our world [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6291.839999999999s)]
*  and are this amazing kind of underground network of creatures [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6294.96s)]
*  that we never see that's contributing to our food system too. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6298.08s)]
*  So is the way that bees pollinate, [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6302.2s)]
*  is it a secondary effect of their foraging? [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6305.12s)]
*  Yes, I mean, it's just a great byproduct of bees [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6309.08s)]
*  doing the work that bees do. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6312.0s)]
*  When bees go out into the world every day [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6314.04s)]
*  and do the work that they need to do to survive for their colony, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6316.599999999999s)]
*  they're also offering our planet [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6320.96s)]
*  one of the most amazing services of pollination, [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6323.48s)]
*  of making sure other plants can reproduce and survive, [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6327.16s)]
*  and they don't even know they're doing this. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6331.4s)]
*  So when they go and collect pollen and nectar from a plant, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6333.879999999999s)]
*  you know, they're bringing that pollen to another plant, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6337.879999999999s)]
*  so plants have the problem when it comes to reproduction [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6340.719999999999s)]
*  that they can't move, so they need help to reproduce, [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6343.28s)]
*  and that is what bees are doing. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6347.04s)]
*  And are they the only insects that pollinate? [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6350.08s)]
*  Do wasps pollinate as well? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6352.4s)]
*  Wasps pollinate, you know, butterflies, birds, bats. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6354.2s)]
*  There's lots of pollinators. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6358.08s)]
*  Birds. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6359.88s)]
*  Birds can be pollinators when they feed on, you know, [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6360.88s)]
*  a plant, on a flowering plant, and go to another flowering plant. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6364.0s)]
*  They can take the pollen from one flowering plant [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6367.12s)]
*  and make sure it meets the female part of the other plant. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6370.8s)]
*  You know, anything that's feeding on these flowering plants [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6373.04s)]
*  can be a pollinator. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6376.08s)]
*  Wow, what a fascinating sort of symbiotic relationship. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6377.88s)]
*  That we never think about or see, you know? [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6382.64s)]
*  I mean, and plants and bees evolve together, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6385.28s)]
*  so as wasps evolved into bees and as these bees figured out [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6388.56s)]
*  that pollen and nectar were great sources of food, [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6393.4800000000005s)]
*  the plants figured out it was beneficial for them [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6396.68s)]
*  to be able to attract these bees to the plant, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6399.4800000000005s)]
*  and so they became more showy and vibrant and colorful. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6403.6s)]
*  Wow. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6407.56s)]
*  They have a mutual relationship, so, you know, it's so incredible. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6408.76s)]
*  I mean, it's so interesting that we know so little about bees [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6414.04s)]
*  and that people don't think about them often, [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6417.36s)]
*  but they're around us all the time. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6419.32s)]
*  I mean, you know, they're outside and they put food on our table [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6421.24s)]
*  and they mean so much to our world, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6425.4s)]
*  but we just, we, people rarely think about them [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6427.0s)]
*  until maybe they show up in your backyard, you know, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6430.5199999999995s)]
*  and you need someone like me to come and remove them. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6432.32s)]
*  One of the things that we covered really recently [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6434.639999999999s)]
*  is the large amount of wasps that will inject their larva [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6436.5599999999995s)]
*  into other creatures and use these parasitic, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6443.28s)]
*  like, relationships with, like, caterpillars. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6448.599999999999s)]
*  And do you know about all this? [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6451.599999999999s)]
*  Not from the wasps family, no. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6452.719999999999s)]
*  Go to that caterpillar that we showed the other day [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6455.4s)]
*  with the, where it implants all the larva into the caterpillar, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6458.08s)]
*  and then the caterpillar will die [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6463.4s)]
*  and these larva exude from its skin. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6467.0s)]
*  Is that the wasps' only way of reproduction? [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6471.56s)]
*  Yeah, there's a bunch of different wasps that do this, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6474.04s)]
*  a large number of wasps that have parasitic relationships [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6477.240000000001s)]
*  with other ants and different creatures, and they sting. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6482.360000000001s)]
*  You know the tarantula hawk, right? [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6486.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you know about that one? [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6488.120000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6488.96s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6489.320000000001s)]
*  It stings a tarantula, embeds the tarantula with its larva, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6490.200000000001s)]
*  and then the larva eat the body of the tarantula [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6495.160000000001s)]
*  and burst out of its body. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6498.120000000001s)]
*  Go to a tarantula hawk because that's one of the ones [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6499.6s)]
*  that my friend Maynard sent me. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6503.88s)]
*  He sent you? [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6505.320000000001s)]
*  Do we have that guy? [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6506.96s)]
*  Is that? [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6508.4800000000005s)]
*  It's probably in our box somewhere from our old studio. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6508.96s)]
*  Yeah, he got one from his farm and he sent it to me in a glass of vial. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6512.320000000001s)]
*  It's huge. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6515.4800000000005s)]
*  They're huge, like a finger. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6516.84s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6518.200000000001s)]
*  Look at the size of that sucker. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6518.92s)]
*  Gigantic. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6521.4400000000005s)]
*  So they'll sweep down, jack a tarantula, sting it. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6522.360000000001s)]
*  See if you can find a video of it, because it's pretty amazing. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6527.04s)]
*  When the larva come out of the tarantula's body, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6529.58s)]
*  paralyzes a spider. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6534.86s)]
*  Video from Arizona. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6536.5s)]
*  Yeah, Arizona, that's where Maynard lives. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6537.7s)]
*  So the tarantula hawk will swoop down, get a hold of this tarantula. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6539.78s)]
*  I think I already got it. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6547.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, it already got it. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6548.3s)]
*  It already stung it. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6549.0199999999995s)]
*  Now he's just hanging back, waiting for it to die. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6550.34s)]
*  And once it paralyzes it, it injects the body of this thing. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6555.02s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6560.740000000001s)]
*  It just crawls back like it was under a car. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6561.26s)]
*  Yeah, like it's under the hood. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6563.34s)]
*  Let's check the exhaust system here. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6565.540000000001s)]
*  And injects its body with its, look at that, it's on its back. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6568.620000000001s)]
*  Look how it's doing it. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6573.26s)]
*  That is amazing. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6574.38s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6577.02s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6578.660000000001s)]
*  And then it dies. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6579.34s)]
*  And so it falls over onto its back, and then the tarantula hawk [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6580.540000000001s)]
*  just sort of keeps jacking it. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6584.02s)]
*  I'm amazed that you didn't know about this. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6587.620000000001s)]
*  I'm so happy that we could show you something. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6590.9400000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6592.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, apparently there's a very large number [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6594.540000000001s)]
*  of wasps that have these sort of parasitic relationships [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6597.34s)]
*  with other insects. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6601.1s)]
*  I mean, there are a lot of, I mean, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6602.18s)]
*  bees have a parasite that lives on them and harms them. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6603.740000000001s)]
*  You know, there's something called the ferroa mite, [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6607.1s)]
*  and it's an exo parasite that lives on the bee [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6609.860000000001s)]
*  and feeds off the fat bodies of bees, which we didn't actually [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6613.02s)]
*  know. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6617.46s)]
*  You know, we've known about this pest in the beehive [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6618.620000000001s)]
*  for a long time, since the early 1900s, [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6620.9400000000005s)]
*  but it wasn't until 2018 that Dr. Sammy Ramsey found out [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6623.18s)]
*  what the biggest, or arguably the biggest, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6627.860000000001s)]
*  threat facing bees is feeding from. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6630.740000000001s)]
*  We thought it was feeding from kind of its blood forever, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6632.42s)]
*  but it's not. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6635.26s)]
*  It's feeding from the fat bodies of bees, [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6635.820000000001s)]
*  but it lives on the bee or on the baby bees, and it will, [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6637.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, if it was on us, it would be like the size [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6641.66s)]
*  of a rabbit on us. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6643.58s)]
*  Oh, god. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6644.9s)]
*  So it's huge on the bee. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6645.42s)]
*  I mean, you can see them. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6647.26s)]
*  They're usually on the underside, the undercarriage, [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6648.34s)]
*  but, you know, it's awful for bees, but it's like that. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6650.9s)]
*  It's an exo parasite that lives off another animal. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6655.66s)]
*  It really is interesting how many, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6660.86s)]
*  like that shape of what a wasp and a bee looks like, [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6663.66s)]
*  but how much variety there is in the way they live [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6667.74s)]
*  and what they do. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6671.14s)]
*  Sure. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6672.06s)]
*  And you know how they're all, of course, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6672.780000000001s)]
*  they all have their own job. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6674.9800000000005s)]
*  They're all suited for these different climates, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6676.22s)]
*  and it's amazing. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6678.14s)]
*  Have you seen the one that has a really long needle-like thing [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6680.06s)]
*  that comes out of its abdomen and injects larvae into wood? [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6684.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6688.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what is that called again? [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6690.34s)]
*  The wood wasp, I believe, but it almost [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6691.860000000001s)]
*  looks like a ruler or like a needle coming out [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6694.820000000001s)]
*  of the back of it. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6697.780000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, if it's the stinger, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6698.860000000001s)]
*  the stinger is a modified ovipositor, something [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6700.34s)]
*  that lays and positions eggs. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6702.82s)]
*  So that's why only the female bees have a stinger [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6706.18s)]
*  is because they only have the ovipositor that's [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6708.82s)]
*  able to lay and position eggs. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6712.42s)]
*  So I don't know if that's what it is, but it could be that. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6714.46s)]
*  Because it goes into like logs, and this long thing [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6717.78s)]
*  allows it to inject its larvae into these crevices. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6722.82s)]
*  And it's really long. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6727.06s)]
*  It's like half the size of its body. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6728.06s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6730.1s)]
*  So this wasp deposits parasitic larvae deep inside its trunk. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6731.58s)]
*  Look at the size of that thing. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6738.06s)]
*  It's way longer than its body. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6740.14s)]
*  It must be curled up in there when that is amazing. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6742.18s)]
*  So it finds a little crack. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6747.14s)]
*  And once it finds a crack, then watch how it injects it. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6748.740000000001s)]
*  It sort of like dunks it into the crack, [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6752.740000000001s)]
*  and it's dropping off larvae. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6756.14s)]
*  And look at the back of it. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6757.9800000000005s)]
*  That is incredible. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6759.86s)]
*  It's this large. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6761.179999999999s)]
*  It looks like a translucent bubble, like a large water bag. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6762.82s)]
*  Oh my god, look at that. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6769.46s)]
*  Look at it. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6773.0199999999995s)]
*  It's injecting them. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6773.54s)]
*  So it's injecting these larvae. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6776.62s)]
*  There's a 3D artistic rendering of what it looks like. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6779.5s)]
*  It almost looks like he's drilling for oil. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6783.219999999999s)]
*  She's drilling for oil. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6785.179999999999s)]
*  Look how deep it gets. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6786.38s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6787.339999999999s)]
*  It goes all the way deep into the log, [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6789.94s)]
*  and then it drops off its larvae in there. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6792.74s)]
*  And the larvae survive eating the tissue or eating the wood. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6794.7s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6802.339999999999s)]
*  These relationships that these things have is so bizarre. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6804.099999999999s)]
*  There's so many bizarre parasitic relationships. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6807.74s)]
*  And then there's relationships that fungus have, [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6812.54s)]
*  parasitic relationships that fungus have with insects, [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6815.219999999999s)]
*  which is like the cordyceps mushroom that infects ants [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6818.54s)]
*  and causes these ants to explode. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6821.7s)]
*  And these ants release these spores that will then [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6824.66s)]
*  infect all the ants around them. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6827.9s)]
*  So when ants find that one of their ants [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6830.34s)]
*  has been killed and infected by this mushroom, by this fungus, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6832.74s)]
*  they will drag this ant far away from the colony. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6836.9s)]
*  Do you know about that? [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6840.54s)]
*  No, but we see it in the bee colony. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6841.54s)]
*  We have undertaker bees that will haul the dead bees out [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6843.34s)]
*  of the hive, and they will always do it as far away [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6846.78s)]
*  as possible. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6848.78s)]
*  They'll always haul the dead bee out as far away as possible [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6849.82s)]
*  so that they don't infect the colony with whatever [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6852.34s)]
*  the bee died from. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6855.099999999999s)]
*  Get that one, the fungus that infects ants. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6857.179999999999s)]
*  It's cordyceps mushroom. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6860.86s)]
*  It gets bees too, apparently. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6862.179999999999s)]
*  Does it? [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6863.82s)]
*  Same kind of sort of situation. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6864.9s)]
*  Well, the ants, once it does it, see these fungus. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6867.74s)]
*  Look at it. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6871.219999999999s)]
*  Mushrooms grow out of the body of these bees and ants. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6871.74s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6876.42s)]
*  But with some, they get to a certain point [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6878.1s)]
*  where the heads of these things will explode. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6881.02s)]
*  It looks like a head, like a ball. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6884.42s)]
*  And it'll explode and release millions of spore into the air. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6886.74s)]
*  And when it does that, then everyone's doomed, [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6891.82s)]
*  because they'll all get infected by it. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6894.82s)]
*  This cordyceps mushroom, in fact, is used as a supplement. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6897.02s)]
*  It actually increases oxygen utilization in humans. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6901.66s)]
*  So there's a thing that my supplement company on it [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6905.06s)]
*  sells called shroom tech. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6907.660000000001s)]
*  That's what it looks like when it pops out. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6909.620000000001s)]
*  And then that thing will explode. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6911.620000000001s)]
*  Shroom tech is a supplement that's [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6913.46s)]
*  based on the cordyceps mushroom that the Chinese Olympic [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6917.02s)]
*  team started using in track and field events, [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6920.620000000001s)]
*  because it optimized your access to oxygen in some way. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6923.46s)]
*  The way they found it is high altitude hurting populations [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6927.820000000001s)]
*  would notice that these cattle were [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6931.54s)]
*  grazing on these particular mushrooms. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6933.94s)]
*  And they found them to be more active. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6936.82s)]
*  And so then they started eating them. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6939.0599999999995s)]
*  And the way they farm them, it's wild. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6940.98s)]
*  They farm them on caterpillars. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6943.339999999999s)]
*  They farm the mushrooms on caterpillars? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6945.219999999999s)]
*  They farm the cordyceps mushroom on caterpillars. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6947.0599999999995s)]
*  Why? [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6950.259999999999s)]
*  Because that's the way they grow the best. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6950.94s)]
*  Yeah, because they're sort of a parasitic mushroom. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6953.0599999999995s)]
*  The same sort of mushroom that's exploding. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6955.339999999999s)]
*  And see if you can find a video of them exploding. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6958.9s)]
*  It was pretty wild. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6961.0599999999995s)]
*  Do they only have to grow them at certain altitudes still? [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6962.54s)]
*  Have they figured that out? [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6965.58s)]
*  I don't think they have to be at altitude to grow them. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6967.54s)]
*  I'm not sure about that. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6970.74s)]
*  But I do know that they grow them on caterpillars. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6972.06s)]
*  Because when we were sourcing them for that supplement, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6975.5s)]
*  we were like, what? [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6979.7s)]
*  Like, they're growing them on caterpillars? [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6981.14s)]
*  This is fucking crazy. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6982.62s)]
*  That's so interesting. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6983.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's really interesting. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6984.5s)]
*  But that relationship that they have, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6986.1s)]
*  it was really fascinating to me, is [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6988.58s)]
*  that the ants seem to recognize. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6990.22s)]
*  So this is the great one. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6993.22s)]
*  So these things grow all over this ant. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6995.9800000000005s)]
*  And they take over the ant's body. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=6999.820000000001s)]
*  And once they get to a certain size, look at this. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7003.58s)]
*  We're watching a time lapse. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7008.62s)]
*  This is actually from Netflix. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7010.5s)]
*  What's the show that it's from? [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7011.860000000001s)]
*  Look how cool this is. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7014.3s)]
*  Look, it sprouts out of the body like a tree. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7015.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, it also looks like just little hairs are [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7019.66s)]
*  growing all over its body. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7022.9s)]
*  Also, this is happening very slowly, right? [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7024.78s)]
*  But if you watch it the way we're watching, it's so creepy. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7028.5s)]
*  It's like a scene from the movie Alien. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7031.74s)]
*  It does. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7033.46s)]
*  So this ball, which contains all the spores, [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7034.0599999999995s)]
*  grows off of this stalk. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7036.74s)]
*  And notice how it goes high in the air. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7038.3s)]
*  Is that at the end of that? [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7040.82s)]
*  Oh, unfortunately. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7042.3s)]
*  So it grows high in the air so it can catch wind. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7043.3s)]
*  When it blows up, it sprays all over all the other ants. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7047.139999999999s)]
*  So if it happens in the colony, the ants realize, [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7050.66s)]
*  oh, we're all doomed. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7053.58s)]
*  So let's drag this away. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7054.5s)]
*  So if it happens in the colony, drag this ant way out of town [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7056.139999999999s)]
*  and let them die out there. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7060.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, it makes sense, though, right? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7061.54s)]
*  So much of what I see bees do is just what makes sense [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7063.099999999999s)]
*  and what's most efficient and what's best [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7066.38s)]
*  for the good of the colony. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7069.46s)]
*  But how do they know? [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7071.099999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7072.74s)]
*  I don't know how they know. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7074.0599999999995s)]
*  How do these ants know? [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7075.22s)]
*  Obviously, they've only been alive for a week, right? [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7076.9800000000005s)]
*  So where are they getting the information? [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7079.46s)]
*  How do they know that there's a fungus growing on this ant [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7081.14s)]
*  that is going to kill everybody if they don't get it out of town? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7083.780000000001s)]
*  And they know so much more than we do. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7086.42s)]
*  I mean, they knew this was the process. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7087.9800000000005s)]
*  Is that one going to blow? [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7091.02s)]
*  Oh, so look. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7092.22s)]
*  It's a longer clip. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7092.860000000001s)]
*  OK, good. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7093.58s)]
*  So look at all these little balls that [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7094.46s)]
*  are hanging off of its body. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7096.26s)]
*  Is that crazy? [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7097.38s)]
*  I've never seen anything like that. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7097.9400000000005s)]
*  That's extraordinary. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7099.42s)]
*  It's so extraordinary. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7100.38s)]
*  And fungus, by the way. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7101.3s)]
*  Wow. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7102.7s)]
*  Fungus is more closer to us than it is to plants. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7103.38s)]
*  Fungus breathe oxygen. They breathe oxygen. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7108.66s)]
*  And the way from single-celled organisms [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7113.02s)]
*  over the course of evolution, we're [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7116.46s)]
*  closer to them than they are to plants. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7118.5s)]
*  Look how that thing is. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7121.9400000000005s)]
*  Isn't it crazy? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7123.22s)]
*  How it just grows into this weird-looking tree. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7125.02s)]
*  And it's all just these little branches. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7129.46s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7131.34s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7132.02s)]
*  That's some beetle got jacked. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7133.660000000001s)]
*  Look how tall. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7136.660000000001s)]
*  It's so much bigger than its actual body. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7137.38s)]
*  And that's the fun. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7139.700000000001s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7140.9400000000005s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7143.02s)]
*  And that's these mushroom stalks growing out [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7144.9400000000005s)]
*  of the body of this beetle. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7146.9400000000005s)]
*  And it's a whole world existing on this little insect. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7148.740000000001s)]
*  God, that's so fascinating. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7152.540000000001s)]
*  See if you can find cordyceps mushroom farming [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7154.26s)]
*  on caterpillars. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7157.580000000001s)]
*  See if you can find a video on that. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7159.1s)]
*  Because I've seen that too. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7161.42s)]
*  Well, that's what I got too. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7162.74s)]
*  But I mean commercial production of cordyceps mushrooms. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7165.3s)]
*  And they grow them on caterpillars. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7169.26s)]
*  Look how wild that is. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7171.02s)]
*  I think your friend Paul Stamets has done some great work [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7172.58s)]
*  with mushrooms and bees and figuring out [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7175.5s)]
*  there's a fungi that may be helpful to bees [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7177.42s)]
*  with the varroa mite with killing that mite. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7181.14s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7183.3s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7184.22s)]
*  There's so much symbiosis. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7187.7s)]
*  There's so many relationships going on [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7190.02s)]
*  between these organisms. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7191.660000000001s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7193.06s)]
*  So that's cordyceps mushrooms. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7193.580000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7195.06s)]
*  They call it Himalayan Viagra. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7196.26s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7198.3s)]
*  Well, that makes sense, right? [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7199.3s)]
*  Because nitric oxide and transportation [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7200.580000000001s)]
*  of oxygen and muscles. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7203.780000000001s)]
*  But it improves athletic performance. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7207.540000000001s)]
*  Like you can really tell the difference when you work out [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7211.14s)]
*  with this stuff. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7213.5s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7214.9800000000005s)]
*  So that's a caterpillar. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7216.62s)]
*  The cows could too. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7217.82s)]
*  Yeah, well, they noticed it, like I said, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7220.1s)]
*  from high altitude herding populations. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7222.62s)]
*  Well, the cows probably knew better than us. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7224.58s)]
*  They figured that out. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7226.5s)]
*  Another, right? [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7228.0199999999995s)]
*  That's what's so bizarre about information. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7229.26s)]
*  I mean, I think about that all the time with my dog. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7231.58s)]
*  Because I have one dog, and he doesn't have access [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7234.9s)]
*  to other dogs until my daughter brings her dog over [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7238.26s)]
*  or my friends bring a dog over. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7241.1s)]
*  But he knows all this dog stuff. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7243.0199999999995s)]
*  No one's telling him that he has [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7245.18s)]
*  to pee on these certain trees. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7246.62s)]
*  He has this thing where he rolls in fox poop. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7249.900000000001s)]
*  It's so disgusting. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7252.780000000001s)]
*  But we have this fox that comes and visits our yard. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7254.14s)]
*  And the fox is really cool. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7256.900000000001s)]
*  Have you ever heard a fox bark? [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7259.700000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7261.5s)]
*  They have this weird sound, right? [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7262.06s)]
*  Well, we have a video of this guy in our yard barking. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7264.22s)]
*  I don't know where it is. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7266.780000000001s)]

*  But this guy lives in our girl, lives in our yard sometimes, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7268.700000000001s)]
*  comes in and barks and takes a shit in the yard. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7273.98s)]
*  And my dog, when he finds that shit, he's like, oh, yes. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7276.78s)]
*  And he rolls around in it. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7280.0599999999995s)]
*  And he'll come in the house. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7281.86s)]
*  And I'll let him inside. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7283.179999999999s)]
*  I'm like, what's going on, man? [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7284.179999999999s)]
*  I'm like, what is that? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7285.179999999999s)]
*  Ah, you fucking dummy. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7286.179999999999s)]
*  And he's happy as a lark, right? [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7287.98s)]
*  And proud of himself. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7289.379999999999s)]
*  So happy. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7290.58s)]
*  Just. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7291.86s)]
*  Yeah, this is a fox. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7294.86s)]
*  I think my dog loves the fox. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7295.78s)]
*  I think he's had some interaction with fox. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7298.179999999999s)]
*  Ah. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7300.38s)]

*  But in the documentary Grizzly Man, [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7334.38s)]
*  when that guy lives in the woods long enough, [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7336.88s)]
*  the fox decide that he's their friend. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7339.4800000000005s)]
*  And they just hang out with him. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7341.4800000000005s)]
*  Like right next to him. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7343.28s)]
*  Remember, one of them stole his hat. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7344.78s)]
*  And they were playful with him. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7346.4800000000005s)]
*  They were playing with him. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7348.18s)]
*  I feel like most creatures just want to live peacefully [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7349.38s)]
*  on this planet. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7351.58s)]
*  And so when someone else like him comes along and lives [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7352.48s)]
*  alongside these foxes, they realize [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7354.78s)]
*  he's not there to hurt them. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7357.78s)]
*  And depending upon how big you are, [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7358.98s)]
*  do you see the video that was released from Woodland Hills [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7362.18s)]
*  today where a coyote tries to eat a toddler? [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7364.48s)]
*  No. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7367.28s)]
*  It's horrible. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7367.78s)]
*  This guy is opening up his car door [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7368.78s)]
*  in a suburban neighborhood, regular neighborhood. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7370.78s)]
*  He's in the driveway, opens the door, [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7373.18s)]
*  lets his daughter walk a couple of steps away from the car. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7375.18s)]
*  And he's getting something out of the car. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7378.38s)]
*  And then the coyote comes and snatches the baby [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7380.18s)]
*  and is dragging the toddler away. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7382.58s)]
*  Please. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7384.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7384.58s)]
*  No. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7385.08s)]
*  Don't show her. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7385.58s)]
*  She had a hard time dealing with the bees. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7386.280000000001s)]
*  That's terrible. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7389.68s)]
*  Coyotes are assholes. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7390.38s)]
*  I mean, you have them. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7391.280000000001s)]
*  We have them where we live here on the river. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7392.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7394.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7395.08s)]
*  They're creeps. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7395.58s)]
*  And yeah, they. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7397.18s)]
*  But they're small wolves. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7399.18s)]
*  And they're wolves that have been persecuted by gray wolves. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7401.18s)]
*  And so because of the adaptation, [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7403.58s)]
*  there's a great book called Coyote America by Dan Flores. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7405.58s)]
*  And he details how coyotes, because of the persecution [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7409.08s)]
*  with gray wolves, coyotes are related to. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7414.88s)]
*  They're a type of wolf. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7417.88s)]
*  You think of them as coyote, but they're actually a small wolf. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7419.08s)]
*  And they're related to red wolves. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7421.78s)]
*  But they don't breed with gray wolves. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7423.48s)]
*  So when you hear about coy wolves, [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7426.68s)]
*  that's an eastern wolf is breeding with a coyote, not [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7428.88s)]
*  gray wolves. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7432.68s)]
*  Gray wolves kill coyotes. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7433.38s)]
*  So because they've had this relationship with gray wolves [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7435.28s)]
*  where they were persecuted by gray wolves, [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7438.44s)]
*  coyotes have figured out how to let the other coyotes know [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7440.839999999999s)]
*  when one of them is missing. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7444.639999999999s)]
*  And that's how they call. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7446.04s)]
*  The yipping. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7447.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's like roll call. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7447.839999999999s)]
*  I can hear that at my house all the time. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7449.44s)]
*  They think they do that to communicate [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7451.24s)]
*  when they've killed something. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7452.839999999999s)]
*  And they also think they've done that to do a roll call. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7454.24s)]
*  And when one of them is missing, it causes the female [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7456.839999999999s)]
*  to have more pups. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7460.24s)]
*  And then they spread their boundaries. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7462.339999999999s)]
*  So they move into new neighborhoods. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7464.679999999999s)]
*  So because we eradicated gray wolves from North America [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7466.6s)]
*  up until, what is it, the 90s when they reintroduced them [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7471.6s)]
*  from not North America, but America, United States, [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7475.700000000001s)]
*  where they reintroduced them from Canada to Yellowstone. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7479.0s)]
*  But during that time period when they were killing the wolves, [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7482.0s)]
*  coyotes started spreading. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7486.6s)]
*  And coyotes were spreading a little bit [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7488.6s)]
*  because they were persecuted by the gray wolves. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7490.700000000001s)]
*  And then people started killing coyotes. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7492.700000000001s)]
*  And as people killed coyotes, they [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7494.6s)]
*  spread even wider. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7496.1s)]
*  It had the exact opposite effect they wanted. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7497.3s)]
*  By people killing coyotes, now coyotes [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7499.6s)]
*  are in every single city in North America. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7501.8s)]
*  Every city. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7505.5s)]
*  And 100 years ago, they weren't. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7506.900000000001s)]
*  100 years ago, they were confined to the Northwest. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7508.8s)]
*  Or to the Southwest, rather. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7511.400000000001s)]
*  And I guess the Northwest as well. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7513.8s)]
*  I guess they were mostly in the western United States. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7515.8s)]
*  They were like Montana and Arizona. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7518.200000000001s)]
*  Well, now they're everywhere. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7519.900000000001s)]
*  They're in New York City. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7521.1s)]
*  Coyotes are in the Bronx now. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7522.1s)]
*  I had no idea. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7523.8s)]
*  Oh, coyotes are in Central Park. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7524.7s)]
*  They're in every city in North America. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7527.4s)]
*  They're in Florida. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7529.9s)]
*  Coyotes are literally everywhere. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7531.7s)]
*  Because they have this unique ability to move and adapt. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7534.3s)]
*  And they're just very smart. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7539.599999999999s)]
*  They're very cunning. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7541.3s)]
*  They tricked one of my dogs into breaking into a chicken coop [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7542.599999999999s)]
*  so they could steal chickens. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7546.4s)]
*  They tricked the dog into doing this? [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7548.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7550.0s)]
*  I had a giant dog. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7550.5s)]
*  He was a mastiff. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7551.599999999999s)]
*  And he was a real sweet dog. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7552.7s)]
*  And he's way too big for them to eat. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7554.1s)]
*  And so what they did is they honey-potted him. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7556.400000000001s)]
*  And they decided, I'm your friend. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7559.1s)]
*  And he's like, I like dogs. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7561.1s)]
*  You're my friend. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7562.400000000001s)]
*  See, he doesn't know that it's a coyote. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7563.400000000001s)]
*  He thinks it's a dog. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7565.0s)]
*  So my pool guy had left this gate open. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7566.200000000001s)]
*  And we had a chicken coop. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7569.3s)]
*  And I don't know if you've ever bred chickens. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7570.6s)]
*  I have chickens. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7572.8s)]
*  OK, great. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7573.6s)]
*  So you know about brooding. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7574.200000000001s)]
*  So we had this one chicken that was brooding. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7576.0s)]
*  And when the hen was brooding, we [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7578.1s)]
*  put her in a separate smaller pen where she has to stand. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7579.6s)]
*  She can't sit in the nest as a post. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7584.2s)]
*  And because she's in this stand with this smaller pen [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7586.9s)]
*  with her feet on this post, after a while, [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7592.0s)]
*  she gets over the idea that she's got this unfertilized egg [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7594.7s)]
*  that she thinks she's going to raise into a chicken. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7598.099999999999s)]
*  That's what the brooding is. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7600.5s)]
*  And they'll sit on this egg. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7601.799999999999s)]
*  They just decide that this is going [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7603.2s)]
*  to be the egg that gives them a chick. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7604.7s)]
*  It's kind of sad because there's no rooster. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7606.4s)]
*  So they never get fertilized. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7609.2s)]
*  Well, when the coyote recognized that this was a smaller pen, [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7610.5s)]
*  they had been trying to get in the big one. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7615.5s)]
*  It was too fortified. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7617.9s)]
*  But the smaller one, they're like, [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7619.4s)]
*  I can get this big dumb motherfucker to break into this. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7620.8s)]
*  So this coyote tricked my dog into destroying that pen. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7624.0s)]
*  He had never done that before. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7628.8s)]
*  I was in my house with my family. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7630.9s)]
*  And we were playing some board game. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7632.8s)]
*  And I look out the window. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7634.9s)]
*  And I see a coyote running across my backyard [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7636.6s)]
*  with a chicken in his mouth. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7639.4s)]
*  And I'm like, what the fuck is going on? [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7641.099999999999s)]
*  And what was your dog doing? [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7642.7s)]
*  Was he just standing by? [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7643.9s)]
*  He destroyed the pen. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7645.299999999999s)]
*  So he was over by the pen that he had torn apart [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7646.599999999999s)]
*  because he's 140 pounds. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7649.099999999999s)]
*  He was huge. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7650.599999999999s)]
*  So he just destroyed this pen. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7651.7s)]
*  Was he going after the chickens? [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7653.299999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7654.7s)]
*  The coyote talked him into it. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7655.299999999999s)]
*  And was the dog going after the chickens as well? [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7656.799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7658.599999999999s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7659.099999999999s)]
*  But it was only one chicken in this one smaller pen. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7660.799999999999s)]
*  So he destroys this pen. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7664.2s)]
*  The coyote is like, thank you, grabs it, [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7666.4s)]
*  and hops over the fence. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7668.6s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7669.6s)]
*  And so I go over, like, what the fuck happened? [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7671.1s)]
*  I go over there. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7672.900000000001s)]
*  And I see Johnny. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7673.400000000001s)]
*  His name is Johnny Cash. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7674.400000000001s)]
*  And Johnny is standing there going, what's up? [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7675.6s)]
*  And I go, what did you do, man? [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7678.6s)]
*  You fucking let the coyote into the. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7680.200000000001s)]
*  And I realized, looking at this pen, [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7682.200000000001s)]
*  there's no way that little coyote could have done it. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7684.3s)]
*  It was a 35 pound coyote. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7686.400000000001s)]
*  It was him. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7687.900000000001s)]
*  He did it. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7688.400000000001s)]
*  And he had one job. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7688.900000000001s)]
*  And then he realized that it's fun to kill chickens. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7690.1s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7692.400000000001s)]
*  So unfortunately, then he also realized [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7692.900000000001s)]
*  that he's strong enough to go through the large chicken [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7694.700000000001s)]
*  coop. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7698.0s)]
*  So he tore a hole in the large chicken coop [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7698.6s)]
*  and went on a rampage and killed like nine chickens one day. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7701.1s)]
*  Oh, I'm so sorry. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7704.3s)]
*  That was a bummer. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7705.3s)]
*  It must have been traumatic. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7706.1s)]
*  That was a bummer. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7707.2s)]
*  But at least it was him. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7708.1s)]
*  And then we had a fire. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7709.4s)]
*  And then the chicken coop burnt to the ground. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7711.1s)]
*  Then we had to take the chickens and put them in another coop. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7713.0s)]
*  And then the coyotes broke into that and they killed them all. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7714.8s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7716.7s)]
*  So it went into the yard one day. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7717.3s)]
*  And it was just feathers everywhere [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7719.5s)]
*  and just dead chickens. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7721.0s)]
*  It was a mess. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7722.4s)]
*  Do you have chickens now? [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7723.3s)]
*  We do not. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7724.4s)]
*  But we want to get chickens again. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7725.5s)]
*  Do you have coyotes now? [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7727.2s)]
*  Yes. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7728.4s)]
*  Yes, we have coyotes. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7729.4s)]
*  But I've got some mitigation techniques [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7730.5s)]
*  that I'm going to use to get rid of some coyotes. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7734.9s)]
*  Is Marshall, is he helpful at all? [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7736.9s)]
*  I don't think he's helpful. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7738.599999999999s)]
*  I was hoping he would be here. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7739.4s)]
*  Oh, I was going to bring him. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7740.7s)]
*  I'm a big dog fan. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7741.7s)]
*  Oh, I would have brought him if I had known. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7742.5s)]
*  I was going to bring him. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7743.9s)]
*  But he was tired. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7744.9s)]
*  We threw the ball today. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7746.4s)]
*  And he was a little exhausted. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7747.7s)]
*  I didn't want to throw him up. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7748.7s)]
*  Hey. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7749.8s)]
*  Sometimes if he's. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7750.3s)]
*  Don't get out of bed for me, Marshall. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7750.9s)]
*  It's not that. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7752.3s)]
*  Like sometimes if he eats and he ate kind of right [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7753.099999999999s)]
*  before we got here, I'm like, he'll probably [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7756.400000000001s)]
*  throw up in the car. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7758.6s)]
*  He's weird. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7761.0s)]
*  He won't throw up in the car if I'm touching him. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7761.8s)]
*  So I have a Land Cruiser, which is pretty small. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7764.8s)]
*  So he sits and he puts his head on the center console. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7768.6s)]
*  And as long as I'm petting him, he won't puke. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7771.900000000001s)]
*  But as soon as I stop petting him, he's like, bleh. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7774.5s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7776.6s)]
*  It's something about being in the car. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7779.8s)]
*  Well, it sounds like something about you too, and the comfort [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7782.0s)]
*  and you petting him. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7784.400000000001s)]
*  Well, he's a love sponge. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7785.3s)]
*  Golden Retrievers are love sponges. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7786.9s)]
*  That dog just wants to cuddle with you all the time. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7788.9s)]
*  You should get another one. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7791.599999999999s)]
*  I think so. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7793.0s)]
*  But Mrs. Rogan is not so convinced. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7794.0s)]
*  She thinks it's more work, another dog. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7796.599999999999s)]
*  I think it's the opposite. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7799.2s)]
*  I think it's less work, because then they have a buddy. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7800.5s)]
*  We have a theory in our house. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7803.5s)]
*  It's like a sourdough. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7804.7s)]
*  So Marshall can be like the starter. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7806.3s)]
*  And I have one really great. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7808.8s)]
*  I have four really great dogs. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7811.599999999999s)]
*  But my first dog, Shelby, is just [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7813.0s)]
*  like quintessential great dog. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7815.3s)]
*  And so we just got to add to the starter. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7817.2s)]
*  And now we're up to four. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7819.0s)]
*  But space him apart age-wise, and let [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7820.4s)]
*  him teach the next generation how to be in your house [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7823.8s)]
*  and around you and what you like. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7827.3s)]
*  And it's just the sourdough. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7828.8s)]
*  Maybe I'll talk her into it. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7833.3s)]
*  It's, you know, we had five dogs at one point. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7834.6s)]
*  Wow. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7839.3s)]
*  And so I think she's a little traumatized [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7840.4s)]
*  by the five dog experience, which is a little crazy. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7842.1s)]
*  Five is a lot. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7844.5s)]
*  It's a lot. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7845.200000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of dogs running around. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7845.8s)]
*  Also a lot of joy. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7847.8s)]
*  Listen, if it was up to me, I can't even [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7849.5s)]
*  go to like a dog pound. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7852.8s)]
*  I'd have 100 dogs. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7854.1s)]
*  I really would. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7855.400000000001s)]
*  I love dogs. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7857.200000000001s)]
*  Me too. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7857.900000000001s)]
*  But you know, you got to pick your battles. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7858.700000000001s)]
*  Be practical sometimes. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7862.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7863.6s)]
*  I mean, I love animals, period. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7864.5s)]
*  I would love to live on a ranch. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7866.3s)]
*  I think living on a ranch and living [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7867.6s)]
*  with animals, both domestic and wild, that's like, I think. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7871.2s)]
*  I'm like you. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7876.7s)]
*  I'm not as fascinated by bees, obviously. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7878.0s)]
*  But I, like you, am just very fascinated by wildlife [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7880.0s)]
*  in general. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7884.4s)]
*  And something, it changes you when you move out and can [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7885.3s)]
*  live more alongside nature. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7889.0s)]
*  Or at least it did for me. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7891.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, I am from Texas. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7892.099999999999s)]
*  I've lived in an urban area my whole life. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7893.8s)]
*  I've lived in Austin for 15 years and then just moved out [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7895.599999999999s)]
*  to a little piece of dirt, you know, on the Colorado River [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7898.599999999999s)]
*  and just living in sync with the seasons [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7900.8s)]
*  and noticing everything and living in the rhythm of nature [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7904.1s)]
*  has really changed my life and kind of slows down [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7908.3s)]
*  the pace of life. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7912.1s)]
*  Yes. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7913.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think everybody should have a little piece of dirt [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7914.5s)]
*  and grow some food. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7916.6s)]
*  I think that's how, I think it resonates with people [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7918.1s)]
*  because I think that's how humans have existed forever. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7920.900000000001s)]
*  And when you live like that, your body's like, oh, [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7924.0s)]
*  this is better. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7927.0s)]
*  Because I think your body, when it's in Manhattan, [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7927.8s)]
*  you're like, this is great. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7929.9s)]
*  There's so many cars and so many people. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7930.9s)]
*  But your body's like, what the fuck, man? [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7932.599999999999s)]
*  Can we get a break? [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7934.2s)]
*  When there's some calm and nature [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7935.4s)]
*  and there's no calmer nature unless you go to Central Park. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7937.799999999999s)]
*  And even then, it's like a weird little. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7940.299999999999s)]
*  Coyotes, apparently. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7941.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7942.599999999999s)]
*  Have you seen them there? [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7943.2s)]
*  I have not. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7944.2s)]
*  But. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7944.9s)]
*  Show the video. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7945.4s)]
*  Because it's kind of crazy to see them [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7946.2s)]
*  running around Central Park. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7947.299999999999s)]
*  And there's a lot of them. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7948.799999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7949.9s)]
*  Yeah, they're in the Bronx. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7950.4s)]
*  They're in abandoned buildings and shit. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7951.299999999999s)]
*  People find them. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7953.2s)]
*  And what's disturbing is their diet is, a large part of it [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7954.299999999999s)]
*  is house pets. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7959.1s)]
*  I mean, it must probably have to be in that sort of environment. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7960.900000000001s)]
*  Cats and dogs. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7963.400000000001s)]
*  Because what else is there? [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7963.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7965.0s)]
*  Well, in urban areas, like, there it goes. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7965.5s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7969.8s)]
*  Roaming around Central Park, small wolf. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7972.5s)]
*  Wow. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7974.900000000001s)]
*  How strange. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7975.400000000001s)]
*  It's like that movie, I Am a Legend. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7977.1s)]
*  It's almost like nature can't wait for us to go away. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7978.700000000001s)]
*  And then it'll just repopulate. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7981.900000000001s)]
*  And we're never here. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7983.8s)]
*  I mean, that's what I think about the bees. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7984.900000000001s)]
*  They've been here so much longer than us. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7986.700000000001s)]
*  Honey bees. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7988.3s)]
*  Well, those, I mean, they've. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7989.6s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7991.2s)]
*  I did not know that. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7992.3s)]
*  That's probably the most interesting thing [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7993.3s)]
*  that I've learned today is that we brought them here. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7995.2s)]
*  Yep. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7997.6s)]
*  Honey bees are not native to the United States [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=7998.1s)]
*  or to North America. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8000.5s)]
*  So how difficult is it if someone, oh, by the way, shout [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8001.8s)]
*  out to my buddy Steve, Steve Ryan, who is a beekeeper. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8004.8s)]
*  He's one of the first people that I know that I've ever [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8008.0s)]
*  met that taught me or told me how he raises bees. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8010.2s)]
*  And he gave me some of his honey from his own bees. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8014.3s)]
*  I'm like, that is cool. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8016.7s)]
*  I've always thought that would be a cool thing to do. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8018.0s)]
*  But how difficult is it to have your own little hive [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8020.2s)]
*  and colony and the whole, the way you do it? [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8023.8s)]
*  It's really not that difficult. I tell people [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8025.9s)]
*  it's sort of akin to keeping a garden where it's more labor [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8027.9s)]
*  intensive at different points throughout the year. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8031.4s)]
*  And of course, once you first get started and get going, [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8033.8s)]
*  there's a big learning curve. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8037.8s)]
*  And you just have to learn a lot. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8038.8s)]
*  And you do that through spending a lot of time [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8040.6s)]
*  with bees, with your bees. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8042.5s)]
*  But depending on how many colonies you keep, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8044.2s)]
*  it can be not that labor intensive and a wonderfully [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8047.099999999999s)]
*  fulfilling hobby or profession as far as you want to take it. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8051.0s)]
*  And when you extract honey, you brought us some honeycombs. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8055.8s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8059.099999999999s)]
*  Yes, my pleasure. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8059.8s)]
*  When you extract honey from that, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8060.3s)]
*  do you feel like you're stealing from the bees? [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8062.3s)]
*  I do. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8065.2s)]
*  And so that's why I don't harvest a lot or sell any honey, [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8065.7s)]
*  because it's just not where I find my joy in keeping bees. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8070.0s)]
*  This is a little bit of honey that I harvested in the summer. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8074.5s)]
*  And this is the last of our summer harvest [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8077.9s)]
*  that the bees had. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8080.6s)]
*  And I take a very, very small amount for my personal use [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8081.6s)]
*  and then to share with friends and family [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8086.7s)]
*  or people who have helped me in the bees. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8088.4s)]
*  And that's as much as I personally want to take. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8090.5s)]
*  I was lucky early on in my beekeeping journey [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8096.0s)]
*  to figure out that harvesting and selling the honey [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8098.6s)]
*  just wasn't what I loved about keeping bees. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8102.700000000001s)]
*  And at the end of the day, it didn't make me feel that good. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8105.3s)]
*  So this is their food source. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8109.8s)]
*  It's their food source during the winter. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8111.200000000001s)]
*  And we can't predict the weather, of course, [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8113.200000000001s)]
*  and don't know how long the winter will last. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8115.8s)]
*  And when the spring will come, a perfect example [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8118.200000000001s)]
*  is here in Texas last year when we had the major snow [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8121.6s)]
*  apocalypse and everything that was about to bloom, [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8123.900000000001s)]
*  those early blooming plants that the bees really [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8127.3s)]
*  rely on to get them to spring snapped back. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8130.1s)]
*  None of it bloomed. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8134.200000000001s)]
*  Everything died. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8135.0s)]
*  And it was a horrible year for bees and beekeeping. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8136.400000000001s)]
*  And I was thankful to have not really harvested a lot of honey [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8141.200000000001s)]
*  because it was something we could have never predicted [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8144.1s)]
*  and the bees couldn't predict. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8146.900000000001s)]
*  But in the winter, when there's nothing in bloom, [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8148.400000000001s)]
*  there is not an opportunity for the bees [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8151.200000000001s)]
*  to get more food naturally unless the beekeeper provides [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8153.6s)]
*  it. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8156.8s)]
*  They're only collecting food during a short time [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8157.8s)]
*  of the year when the nectar is flowing [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8161.0s)]
*  and when the plants are blooming. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8162.900000000001s)]
*  And so in the winter, when they're not doing that, [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8164.8s)]
*  they're living off what they collected earlier in the year [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8167.400000000001s)]
*  and all the work they did earlier in the year. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8169.900000000001s)]
*  And so when we harvest honey in the summer or fall, [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8172.2s)]
*  it's before the time the bees really need it. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8175.5s)]
*  So we just need to be careful and mindful about how much [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8177.6s)]
*  we take. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8181.0s)]
*  And you can certainly harvest honey responsibly. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8181.5s)]
*  And most all beekeepers do, of course. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8184.0s)]
*  And there's no reason you can't happily harvest honey [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8186.8s)]
*  from your backyard hive if that's your choice. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8190.8s)]
*  You just have to figure out how much to take. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8193.1s)]
*  How do you guess that? [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8196.5s)]
*  I mean, it's hard. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8198.4s)]
*  But it mostly has to do with the size of the colony [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8199.2s)]
*  and trying to figure out how much they'll need [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8201.8s)]
*  and how much they made. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8204.3s)]
*  And depending on the time of the year, [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8205.7s)]
*  how much they need to make it to spring. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8207.6s)]
*  But also as a beekeeper, you can intervene and give them [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8209.9s)]
*  the resources they need to do their job well. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8214.9s)]
*  So you can give them that artificial food [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8217.4s)]
*  that we talked about and supplement their food [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8220.3s)]
*  if you need to. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8222.9s)]
*  But it's never ideal. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8223.6s)]
*  So I can even take honey from one hive [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8225.9s)]
*  and put it in another hive and give it to another colony [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8227.699999999999s)]
*  if there's a weaker colony. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8231.1s)]
*  So the way that we've kept bees in these boxes [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8232.8s)]
*  allows us to manage their space and their resources. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8235.699999999999s)]
*  So we can donate things from one colony to another colony. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8239.9s)]
*  Could you buy commercial honey and introduce it to, [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8244.1s)]
*  like if you bought honey off the shelf? [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8247.300000000001s)]
*  Sure, absolutely. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8249.1s)]
*  That's OK? [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8249.7s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8250.2s)]
*  I mean, there's always a risk that you're [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8251.1s)]
*  buying some adulterated funny honey that's [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8253.1s)]
*  been cut with corn syrup or something. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8255.7s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8257.9s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8258.5s)]
*  I mean, it was a big problem. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8259.1s)]
*  Oh my god, so it's like drugs? [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8261.2s)]
*  I mean, you cannot always know what you're getting sometimes. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8264.7s)]
*  Wow, I never even thought they would do that. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8270.1s)]
*  Did you even imagine they would cut honey? [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8272.3s)]
*  They do everything. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8274.3s)]
*  People are so gross. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8276.5s)]
*  For sure, for sure. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8277.5s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8278.5s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8279.3s)]
*  They cut it with corn syrup? [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8280.5s)]
*  The demand for honey is at its height. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8282.599999999999s)]
*  It's higher than it's ever been, probably [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8284.699999999999s)]
*  because people like that it's like a natural sweetener, [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8286.3s)]
*  and it's part of a healthier lifestyle. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8289.199999999999s)]
*  But the world's demand for honey is so high, [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8292.199999999999s)]
*  and the supply sometimes can't meet it. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8297.3s)]
*  And there was a situation where beekeepers, or there still is, [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8299.1s)]
*  but people from other countries were importing honey [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8303.4s)]
*  that would be cut with other things. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8306.300000000001s)]
*  And you were essentially getting funny honey. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8308.4s)]
*  It was fake honey. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8311.1s)]
*  And so the best way is to buy honey [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8312.0s)]
*  from your local beekeeper who is not [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8314.1s)]
*  selling that adulterated honey, or just [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8316.1s)]
*  buy it in the comb like this, and you'll know that. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8319.1s)]
*  What's going on here? [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8321.9s)]
*  Honey is the world's third most fake food, according [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8322.7s)]
*  to this article. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8324.9s)]
*  Sometimes Chinese honey is cut with much cheaper corn syrup [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8326.1s)]
*  and fructose syrup to enhance profit margins, [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8329.5s)]
*  and sometimes Chinese producers even feed corn syrup to the bees [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8332.0s)]
*  to get it into the honey more naturally. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8336.4s)]
*  The importation of Chinese honey was specifically [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8340.0s)]
*  banned because it is so often adulterated. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8342.54s)]
*  Oh, China. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8346.6s)]
*  And so people got around that by shipping the honey [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8347.9s)]
*  to a different country. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8353.44s)]
*  So they would ship it to Malaysia, [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8354.56s)]
*  and then import it from Malaysia. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8355.9s)]
*  But it would still be Chinese honey that was cut down. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8357.3s)]
*  Is there a test you could do with drugs? [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8361.9s)]
*  You can certainly test honey. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8363.699999999999s)]
*  Really? [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8364.9s)]
*  How do you do it? [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8365.4s)]
*  There's tests you can do to even there's pollen analysis. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8366.699999999999s)]
*  So you can figure out what the bees were feeding from. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8369.4s)]
*  And every piece of honey is going to be different. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8372.1s)]
*  Every bite of honey is going to be different. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8375.1s)]
*  Every frame of honey you take from a hive [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8376.94s)]
*  is going to have different food sources that the bees were [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8379.0s)]
*  foraging from. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8382.3s)]
*  So it's going to taste different and maybe [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8383.1s)]
*  have a different color. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8385.1s)]
*  And it's all very unique. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8386.1s)]
*  And there's tests that you can do [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8387.98s)]
*  to figure out where the source of the honey, [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8390.06s)]
*  depending on the pollen and the nectar [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8393.300000000001s)]
*  and the source of the plants. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8395.0s)]
*  Is there any sort of commercial test [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8396.2s)]
*  that you can buy where you can test honey to make sure [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8397.7s)]
*  it doesn't have corn syrup in it? [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8399.86s)]
*  I don't know if there's a commercial test. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8401.26s)]
*  Like a drug thing? [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8403.42s)]
*  Like you dip it in to see if it's fentanyl? [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8404.380000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8406.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8407.94s)]
*  Talking to you has made me feel guilty about buying [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8409.380000000001s)]
*  industrialized honey. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8412.140000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean industrialized honey. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8414.02s)]
*  I mean, buy honey from your local beekeeper. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8415.82s)]
*  It's a great way to support beekeepers. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8417.58s)]
*  I never thought of that until today, though. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8419.66s)]
*  I would just see honey on the shelf. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8421.5s)]
*  Oh, there's honey. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8423.539999999999s)]
*  Let me grab that honey. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8424.539999999999s)]
*  Please don't do that. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8425.5s)]
*  Don't buy honey from the shelf. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8426.5s)]
*  Well, no. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8427.58s)]
*  Please always support your local beekeeper who [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8428.06s)]
*  is pulling this honey with the bees in mind. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8430.34s)]
*  My motto is hives before honey. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8435.58s)]
*  And I'm always going to put the health and wellness [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8437.22s)]
*  of the colony and what's going on in the hive [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8439.3s)]
*  before harvesting honey. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8441.22s)]
*  Someone selling, a local beekeeper selling honey [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8443.62s)]
*  at a farmer's market, or if you find local honey that [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8446.900000000001s)]
*  is truly local and from local bees, not just packaged [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8450.140000000001s)]
*  locally, then that's a great way to support beekeepers [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8453.380000000001s)]
*  and the bee population. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8457.060000000001s)]
*  So please don't not buy honey from the store shelves. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8458.42s)]
*  But look for honey that is labeled locally and maybe not [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8461.58s)]
*  the name of the big brand store on it or a big company. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8467.18s)]
*  Or just go to your farmer's market [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8472.78s)]
*  and buy honey from your local beekeeper [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8474.1s)]
*  or your friend who is a beekeeper. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8475.78s)]
*  I mean, that's where you should be buying it. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8477.06s)]
*  He was pretty far away, unfortunately. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8479.34s)]
*  He does now. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8481.46s)]
*  Well, now you know me. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8482.74s)]
*  I do know you. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8484.1s)]
*  Is there a resource that people can go to where [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8484.82s)]
*  they can find local honey? [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8486.98s)]
*  Is there an online website that can direct you [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8488.619999999999s)]
*  to local beekeepers that sell honey? [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8491.82s)]
*  I don't think there's one for honey, like a database, [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8494.02s)]
*  where you can just find local beekeepers just [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8496.34s)]
*  to buy honey from. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8499.14s)]
*  But most beekeepers will offer honey for sale. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8499.98s)]
*  And so just ask your local beekeeper. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8503.34s)]
*  I mean, if you see a beekeeper at a farmer's market [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8506.26s)]
*  or if you find a beekeeper and you really [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8509.34s)]
*  like buying their honey, please support them year after year. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8511.02s)]
*  Beekeeping is so not only local, but really hyper local. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8516.26s)]
*  I mean, bees forage for up to two miles. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8519.46s)]
*  So beekeepers have a great sort of local community built. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8521.66s)]
*  And a lot of cities and counties will have a beekeeping [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8526.82s)]
*  association. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8530.98s)]
*  And so that could be a great place for people to ask, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8531.82s)]
*  email the beekeeping association and say, hey, [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8535.42s)]
*  I'm looking to buy honey and buy honey for the year [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8537.22s)]
*  from one beekeeper for gifts for your friends and family [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8540.98s)]
*  support, a beekeeper that way. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8543.82s)]
*  But if you Google your local beekeeping association, [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8545.619999999999s)]
*  you can find someone very local. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8549.74s)]
*  Because again, beekeeping itself is just [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8551.42s)]
*  something that the bees work in such a small area [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8554.62s)]
*  that I can have hives 10 miles away [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8558.42s)]
*  and they can be completely different [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8560.980000000001s)]
*  when what they're bringing in and what's happening with them. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8562.34s)]
*  You know, even here in Austin, hives on one side of 35 [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8565.5s)]
*  versus the other. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8568.1s)]
*  It's different soil, different. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8568.78s)]
*  I mean, it's just a completely different environment [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8570.980000000001s)]
*  for the bees. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8573.58s)]
*  So always support the local beekeeper. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8574.220000000001s)]
*  That's the best thing you can do. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8576.18s)]
*  And like you said, a farmer's market [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8577.58s)]
*  is probably a good resource for something. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8579.820000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8581.58s)]
*  Why is some honey dark and some honey light? [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8582.58s)]
*  It's just what the bees are foraging from. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8585.34s)]
*  You know, honey has a different flavor profile in addition [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8587.38s)]
*  to having different colors. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8591.46s)]
*  Dark stuff has kind of a rich, weird sort of tangy taste [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8593.22s)]
*  to it almost. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8596.9s)]
*  I mean, a lot of it does. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8597.42s)]
*  But I've even had like avocado honey or cotton honey that, [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8598.74s)]
*  you know. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8602.46s)]
*  Whoa, look at that. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8602.98s)]
*  Oh, that's some. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8603.74s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8604.98s)]
*  That is some colored honey that I found inside one of my hives [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8605.86s)]
*  that I think the bees, it was after 4th of July. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8610.66s)]
*  And I think there was a large parade. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8615.46s)]
*  I think it was actually a snow cone machine just [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8618.02s)]
*  because of all the. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8620.14s)]
*  So there's green honey. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8621.06s)]
*  There's yellow. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8623.42s)]
*  There's a reddish color in there. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8624.1s)]
*  And I think it was the different flavors of maybe [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8625.82s)]
*  like a snow cone machine. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8629.06s)]
*  Wow. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8630.619999999999s)]
*  But you know, I often see dark red honey in a lot of hives [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8631.74s)]
*  that I'm removing from people's backyards that [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8637.26s)]
*  are in really suburban areas where they have a hummingbird, [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8640.06s)]
*  where people have a lot of hummingbird feeders. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8643.1s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8645.22s)]
*  Because people will dye the sugar water red [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8645.9s)]
*  and the bees will feed from the hummingbird feeder. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8648.58s)]
*  Why do they dye the sugar water red? [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8650.98s)]
*  I think people think it attracts more hummingbirds [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8652.42s)]
*  to their feeder. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8654.98s)]
*  Does it? [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8655.939999999999s)]
*  I mean, I have a hummingbird feeder and I don't dye it red. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8656.74s)]
*  So. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8659.38s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8659.9s)]
*  It's like an amber. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8660.58s)]
*  Oh, are those eggs in there? [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8661.42s)]
*  That's actually pollen. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8663.22s)]
*  They'll store the pollen. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8665.14s)]
*  They'll pack it in as much as they can. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8666.38s)]
*  Those little balls, it looks like. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8668.539999999999s)]
*  Those are balls of pollen. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8670.019999999999s)]
*  The way that the bees collect the pollen is they go into the flower, [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8671.38s)]
*  they'll forage for pollen and they store it [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8677.3s)]
*  on the sides of their legs. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8679.259999999998s)]
*  They have these little divots and they'll pack it in [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8681.019999999999s)]
*  in these little balls. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8683.939999999999s)]
*  So if you are buying pollen to eat for your protein shakes [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8685.539999999999s)]
*  or whatever, it's going to come in these little tiny balls [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8688.699999999999s)]
*  of pollen. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8691.06s)]
*  And that's just exactly how it came off the bee. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8691.66s)]
*  Because the way that beekeepers will collect the pollen [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8696.86s)]
*  is the bees will go through an entrance device [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8700.060000000001s)]
*  on the front of the hive and the pollen will scrape off the bee's body [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8704.66s)]
*  and into a container below. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8710.7s)]
*  And so you're getting pollen that was from the plant on the bee's legs, [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8711.94s)]
*  right into your protein shake or whatever. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8715.5s)]
*  And so it'll come into little, it'll be little balls like that [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8718.460000000001s)]
*  because that's how the bees store it and carry it [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8721.18s)]
*  and bring it back to the hive. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8723.900000000001s)]
*  They can carry an insane amount of weight. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8725.58s)]
*  They can carry over half their body weight in pollen [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8727.9s)]
*  and for up to two miles. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8731.18s)]
*  So they're incredibly strong little creatures. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8733.86s)]
*  What is royal jelly? [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8737.34s)]
*  Royal jelly is a special secretion that comes from the gland [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8738.98s)]
*  of every worker bee. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8744.5s)]
*  And it's a food that's fed to the baby bees [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8746.300000000001s)]
*  in the first stage of their development. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8749.58s)]
*  And then again, if you feed it to a queen bee, [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8752.02s)]
*  or if you feed it to a young female egg larvae [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8756.02s)]
*  for the duration of its development, [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8760.02s)]
*  that larva will turn into a queen bee. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8762.9s)]
*  But it's a special secretion that worker bees make. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8765.1s)]
*  And you can kind of think of it like milk, like mother's milk, [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8769.54s)]
*  because it's a food that the younger bees are eating [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8774.62s)]
*  and it's from a gland that all the female bees produce. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8778.42s)]
*  So it's just the food source for younger bees, [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8782.019999999999s)]
*  or bees that haven't developed yet. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8786.46s)]
*  But some folks will harvest royal jelly. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8788.46s)]
*  You can harvest royal jelly kind of scraped out of the cell [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8791.699999999999s)]
*  and harvest royal jelly for cosmetic purposes and whatnot. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8794.3s)]
*  That's what it's for, cosmetic purposes? [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8798.46s)]
*  I thought it was like a food source. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8800.22s)]
*  Well, it is a food source for the bees. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8801.82s)]
*  But I thought for humans. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8803.38s)]
*  I thought people eat it. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8804.5s)]
*  I've heard of people eating it as well. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8805.5s)]
*  But it's not common? [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8808.42s)]
*  I thought it was available at health food stores, [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8809.98s)]
*  like royal jelly. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8812.82s)]
*  I don't know who the number one. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8814.06s)]
*  Royal jelly. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8816.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8817.98s)]
*  So when you see that, like bee pollen, click on that stuff. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8819.62s)]
*  That one right there, yeah. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8823.9s)]
*  How do they get that, Jazz? [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8825.98s)]
*  Royal jelly in honey. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8828.62s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8830.46s)]
*  How much royal jelly and how much actual honey? [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8832.22s)]
*  Royal jelly. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8837.019999999999s)]
*  So it says there are 625 milligrams. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8838.859999999999s)]
*  And then there's bee pollen, 570 milligrams. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8842.22s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8845.46s)]
*  And there's also sugar. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8847.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8848.779999999999s)]
*  But it says raw honey, though. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8849.699999999999s)]
*  Is the sugar just the active sugar [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8853.619999999999s)]
*  that's in the honey itself? [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8855.82s)]
*  Can you click on that again? [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8857.26s)]
*  Like that. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8859.58s)]
*  Yeah, so it says sugar, 8 grams per serving. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8861.26s)]
*  That may be. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8864.02s)]
*  But it says other ingredients, raw honey. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8865.1s)]
*  What are the ingredients? [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8868.02s)]
*  I don't know other ingredients. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8869.02s)]
*  So are they saying that it's just royal jelly and honey? [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8871.82s)]
*  Korean ginseng. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8875.06s)]
*  Oh, there's a lot of jams on that. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8875.98s)]
*  There's ginseng in that. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8877.58s)]
*  I don't know what those people are saying. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8878.9s)]
*  That's a mess. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8880.18s)]
*  Most local beekeepers you can't buy royal jelly from. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8881.5s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8883.98s)]
*  Most beekeepers are not harvesting royal jelly. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8885.140000000001s)]
*  Because it would be bad for the hive. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8888.66s)]
*  It's not something that helps the colony [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8891.5s)]
*  to harvest the royal jelly. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8893.300000000001s)]
*  You seem very opposed to royal jelly. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8894.42s)]
*  Yo, look in your face. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8895.380000000001s)]
*  Don't do that. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8896.58s)]
*  No, I just, you know. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8897.74s)]
*  I mean, there's. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8898.82s)]
*  Other ingredients? [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8900.86s)]
*  None. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8901.58s)]
*  So that's just organic royal jelly. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8902.5s)]
*  It's the same company, too. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJdXM2FZreA&t=8906.74s)]
