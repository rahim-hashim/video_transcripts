# Joe Rogan Experience #2339 - Luis J. Gomez & Big Jay Oakerson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan Podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2.0s)]
*  Thanks for driving and running. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8.0s)]
*  The ever greater and thinner Big Jay Okerson. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9.0s)]
*  Thank you, Manjaro. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=12.0s)]
*  Shout out, Manjaro. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=13.0s)]
*  You're looking good, dude. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=14.0s)]
*  Big ups, Manjaro. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=15.0s)]
*  It's nice to see you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=16.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=17.0s)]
*  I am exercising, too. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=18.0s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=19.0s)]
*  You have to, or it will just be floppy and weird and gross. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=20.0s)]
*  Or it'll eat your bones. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=23.0s)]
*  I guess also, yes, it'll eat your bones, they say. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=25.0s)]
*  I'm real big on taking this stuff and then not really following up with, like, you know [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=27.0s)]
*  what I mean? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=31.0s)]
*  I just started doing testosterone from a company that's like, you know, it's above board taking [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=32.0s)]
*  it, but like, they're like, you should make sure you monitor your blood all the time. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=37.0s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, we'll get to that at some point. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=40.0s)]
*  I'm going to keep taking it, though. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=42.0s)]
*  You don't monitor your blood at all? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=44.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=45.0s)]
*  I don't. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=46.0s)]
*  I don't. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=47.0s)]
*  I don't. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=48.0s)]
*  I don't. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=49.0s)]
*  I don't. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=50.0s)]
*  I'm going to keep taking it, though. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=51.0s)]
*  You don't monitor your blood at all? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=52.0s)]
*  No, not me with any regularity, I think. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=54.0s)]
*  You should probably do that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=57.0s)]
*  Yeah, they did it there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=58.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=59.0s)]
*  Someone I know says they take testosterone and they have to, like, donate blood every [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=60.0s)]
*  month to get blood. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=63.0s)]
*  I've heard that before. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=64.0s)]
*  Because their blood's so thick. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=65.0s)]
*  I've heard that before. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=66.0s)]
*  I talked to my doctor about it because it really doesn't make sense. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=67.0s)]
*  But he has heard of occasions where people had to do that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=69.0s)]
*  To unthicken their blood. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=73.0s)]
*  Like, do you have too much blood or something? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=74.0s)]
*  They're like, how much are you taking? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=76.0s)]
*  Like, what do you do? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=77.0s)]
*  Are you going ham, bro? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=78.0s)]
*  This men's health company saw me coming down the road a mile away. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=80.0s)]
*  They offered me, I'm taking two peptides. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=83.0s)]
*  We already started. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=84.0s)]
*  And I don't even know. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=85.0s)]
*  We started. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=86.0s)]
*  Sorry, we couldn't wait. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=87.0s)]
*  Why didn't you even ask me? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=88.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=89.0s)]
*  While you were on the door, I was like, this doesn't make sense. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=90.0s)]
*  Let's just start. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=92.0s)]
*  I'm taking two peptides that feel like fire. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=93.0s)]
*  It feels like fire when I inject them. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=95.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=97.0s)]
*  What are they? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=98.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=99.0s)]
*  It's the BPC 157. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=100.0s)]
*  That's the one everyone's doing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=101.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=102.0s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=103.0s)]
*  And then something that's blue. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=104.0s)]
*  It's blue. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=105.0s)]
*  Oh, methylene blue? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=106.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=107.0s)]
*  It burns. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=108.0s)]
*  It's not supposed to be up. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=109.0s)]
*  Methylene blue, you're not supposed to inject. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=110.0s)]
*  It's not that then. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=111.0s)]
*  It starts with a G. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=113.0s)]
*  It's some of the letters. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=114.0s)]
*  It's methylene blue. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=115.0s)]
*  It's weird stuff. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=116.0s)]
*  It's a dye for fabrics that people take for its health benefits. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=118.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=124.0s)]
*  It boosts mitochondria or something. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=125.0s)]
*  It's really weird. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=126.0s)]
*  What exactly does it do? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=127.0s)]
*  I should ask, even though I take it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=129.0s)]
*  I don't take it all the time, but I have taken it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=133.0s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=136.0s)]
*  I couldn't describe. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=137.0s)]
*  I couldn't explain. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=138.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=139.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=140.0s)]
*  A medication used in the management and treatment of, what's that word? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=141.0s)]
*  Methylglobinemia. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=148.0s)]
*  Methylglobinemia. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=153.0s)]
*  A condition where hemoglobin decreases its ability to carry oxygen. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=156.0s)]
*  Huh. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=161.0s)]
*  Straight up. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=162.0s)]
*  But it started out as a fabric dye, I'm pretty sure. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=163.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=166.0s)]
*  Doesn't it say that? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=167.0s)]
*  What is it to for humans? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=168.0s)]
*  I think it was a dye. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=171.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=173.0s)]
*  Which is so weird that a dye would have health benefits. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=174.0s)]
*  I grew up in a house of supplements. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=178.0s)]
*  My stepfather was a power lifter. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=180.0s)]
*  So I only know about creatine. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=181.0s)]
*  Sick? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=183.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=184.0s)]
*  Creatine. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=187.0s)]
*  Creatinine was another one that would show up in the house sometimes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=188.0s)]
*  Creatinine? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=190.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=191.0s)]
*  What's that? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=192.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=193.0s)]
*  I think Jason can creatine twice and he's just remembering it wrong. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=194.0s)]
*  No, it was another word. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=197.0s)]
*  Creatine's super creatine. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=199.0s)]
*  Creatine's legit. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=201.0s)]
*  That stuff's super good for you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=203.0s)]
*  I just started taking Tongat Ali for my testosterone. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=205.0s)]
*  Creatinine is a waste product that forms from the breakdown of creatine in muscles. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=209.0s)]
*  Huh. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=215.0s)]
*  Why would I take it? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=216.0s)]
*  There's another natural one. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=218.0s)]
*  I think it's called terkesterone. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=220.0s)]
*  I know Shilajit is good for testosterone. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=222.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a few of those. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=224.0s)]
*  I asked my doctor to put me on testosterone. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=226.0s)]
*  I think we talked about it because you're like, dude, don't worry, fuck your doctor. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=228.0s)]
*  I got a doctor for you. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=231.0s)]
*  And I was just like, maybe I'll just stop smoking weed. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=233.0s)]
*  You think that was killing your testosterone? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=236.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=238.0s)]
*  It was lower than it should have been. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=239.0s)]
*  It was in the high threes and now it's at mid fives. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=241.0s)]
*  Well, a good doctor, what they'll do first is ask you, what do you do for exercise? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=245.0s)]
*  What are you eating? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=249.0s)]
*  How much do you sleep? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=250.0s)]
*  Those things are all the first thing the doctor will ask you. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=251.0s)]
*  And if all that stuff's fucked up, they shouldn't just give you testosterone. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=254.0s)]
*  They should be like, let's fix. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=257.0s)]
*  My place did. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=259.0s)]
*  Shout out Game Day Men's Health. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=260.0s)]
*  Fifteen minutes, they'll give me anything I want in a needle. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=262.0s)]
*  There's a few doctors out there that like to go buck wild. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=265.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=268.0s)]
*  I think they get incentivized. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=269.0s)]
*  I got PRP treatment in my hair. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=270.0s)]
*  I'm not losing my hair. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=271.0s)]
*  They just talked me into it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=272.0s)]
*  Now it's never going away. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=273.0s)]
*  PRP worked? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=275.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=276.0s)]
*  We're going to find out. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=277.0s)]
*  I just got it like two weeks ago. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=278.0s)]
*  Jay is a mark. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=279.0s)]
*  His hair's thinning. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=280.0s)]
*  It's definitely going. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=281.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of topical stuff that you could use these days. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=282.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=285.0s)]
*  There's like a finasteride topical. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=286.0s)]
*  But I would worry that that would get into your skin and into your bloodstream. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=287.0s)]
*  Like that finasteride stuff is crazy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=291.0s)]
*  Like that makes some people very depressed. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=293.0s)]
*  It kills your DHT, which is what keeps your hair from falling out. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=295.0s)]
*  And for some people, it just kills their testosterone. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=299.0s)]
*  They get like super depressed. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=302.0s)]
*  I started losing my hair when I was 18. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=304.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to go to the doctor. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=306.0s)]
*  I started losing my hair when I was 18. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=308.0s)]
*  I just said, fuck it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=310.0s)]
*  I was bald. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=311.0s)]
*  I love not having to talk to a barber. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=312.0s)]
*  That's the best. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=315.0s)]
*  You shave it, which is a big razor. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=316.0s)]
*  Every morning it's fucking wang, wang, wang, wang. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=317.0s)]
*  How do you find out how much that your barber doesn't know you but is a big fan of Ralph [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=319.0s)]
*  Barbosa? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=323.0s)]
*  You guys aren't going to find that out if you don't get your hair cut at a barber. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=324.0s)]
*  Is that what you get from your barber? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=326.0s)]
*  I don't know you, but Ralph Barbosa's the fucking man, dog. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=327.0s)]
*  Oh, Kenny. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=331.0s)]
*  His name's Kenny. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=332.0s)]
*  He's a nice enough guy. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=333.0s)]
*  Ralph Barbosa's slick. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=335.0s)]
*  He's like a slick comedian. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=336.0s)]
*  His punch lines are smooth. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=338.0s)]
*  He's great. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=340.0s)]
*  Very funny man. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=341.0s)]
*  He's got a great- [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=342.0s)]
*  I get fully loaded with him. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=343.0s)]
*  He's got a fun, just his approach. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=344.0s)]
*  Delivery. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=346.0s)]
*  I like it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=347.0s)]
*  It's very slick. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=348.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=349.0s)]
*  And he's sending the elevator down. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=350.0s)]
*  He's going and taking guys on tour that I've never heard of but I think have been around [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=351.0s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=355.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=356.0s)]
*  It's a cool move. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=357.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=358.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=359.0s)]
*  Very good dude. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=360.0s)]
*  He hung out with us at the mothership one night. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=361.0s)]
*  Fun guy. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=362.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=363.0s)]
*  He like, someone said on like George Lopez's show or something, they were like, this guy [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=365.0s)]
*  sucks. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=369.0s)]
*  Or no, George Lopez was like, I don't get it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=370.0s)]
*  He's just whatever. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=371.0s)]
*  And then I think he made fun of him back. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=372.0s)]
*  Well, someone was, I think someone was talking well about him and then George Lopez was very [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=373.0s)]
*  dismissive of him. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=377.28s)]
*  And I think that's what happened. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=379.04s)]
*  And someone asked Ralph about it on something and his response I think is what made it like [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=380.36s)]
*  very popular. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=384.48s)]
*  I think he was just saying because he doesn't like me because one of his comments goes like, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=385.48s)]
*  orderly. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=389.0s)]
*  And I think that just, you know, you show any picture of George Lopez bugging his eyes [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=391.0s)]
*  out and make that hilarious. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=394.76s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=397.16s)]
*  It's good, fucking good fire back. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=398.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=401.12s)]
*  Are you good at living in comedy beefs? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=402.12s)]
*  I'm so terrible at it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=404.04s)]
*  No, I don't like comedy beefs. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=405.2s)]
*  I don't like, I don't like any beefs. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=406.8s)]
*  Louis, you've been in a few where you've gone the bed on, I mean, I guess I have those same [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=408.92s)]
*  beefs too, but I don't engage as much. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=413.12s)]
*  No, I'm the loser. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=414.88s)]
*  I get on a flight and I'll be on Twitter for fucking hours just tweeting at people for no [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=416.76s)]
*  reason. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=420.24s)]
*  No, but I mean like particular like a person you can put a face to like a comic. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=421.24s)]
*  Like not that I haven't had a problem with somebody before, but I mean, like, I don't [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=424.36s)]
*  know, I have a hard time sleeping on like, I'm going to run this person every night and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=429.96s)]
*  we hate each other. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=432.92s)]
*  It's been a while. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=433.92s)]
*  I mean, I'm not, it's just not that serious. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=434.92s)]
*  There's nobody in the world that I hate. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=437.15999999999997s)]
*  Like there's literally no, even people that hate me. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=438.6s)]
*  I'm like, dude, we're cool. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=440.2s)]
*  The guy that murdered your father? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  Dude, I try to get him on my podcast. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=443.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=446.24s)]
*  So the guy, my father was stabbed to death when I was four years old. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=447.24s)]
*  And then years later, after I got out of prison, I was like, let me try to get this guy on [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=449.84s)]
*  my podcast and interview him. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=453.0s)]
*  How interesting would that be? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=454.64s)]
*  But he was already dead. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=456.76s)]
*  Yeah, dude, that would have been insane. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=457.76s)]
*  Yeah, because I didn't, I wasn't like, cause I was a kid. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=459.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=463.2s)]
*  You should imagine him being like a fucking man, like showing up at this young guy's house [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=464.2s)]
*  who you stabbed his dad, you're going to be alone together. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=471.2s)]
*  That guy's going to kill you. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=473.08s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=474.08s)]
*  That's what I would think. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  If I was an old man, I couldn't defend myself. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=476.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't think he was that old. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  He was 17 when he killed my father. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=478.76s)]
*  So he was only 13 years older than me. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  So he'd be like 60 now, I guess. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=483.32s)]
*  Yeah, but this is like a decade ago that I was going to do it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=485.32s)]
*  That guy's a convicted murderer, dude. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=488.24s)]
*  He could fuck your shit up. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=489.64s)]
*  Yeah, but he was a kid and my father beat him up. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=490.64s)]
*  My father was a bully. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=492.64s)]
*  But I think Conor McGregor goes, well, Lewis, I'd like to say I apologize to absolutely [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=493.64s)]
*  fucking nobody at all. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=498.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=500.56s)]
*  But I thought that would have been an interesting conversation. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=502.04s)]
*  I wasn't going into it being like, oh, you killed my father, I'm angry. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=505.92s)]
*  I've got a great life. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=509.16s)]
*  If my father lived, I would be fucking, probably living in Paterson, New Jersey still. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=510.16s)]
*  I'd have a shit life. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=513.36s)]
*  My father was a fucking drug dealer in a pimp if he was alive. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=514.36s)]
*  Yeah, it worked out well. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=519.16s)]
*  Yeah, but that's always, I say, hey, if my dad stuck around, maybe I wouldn't have the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=520.84s)]
*  personality I have and I wouldn't be where I'm at. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=524.52s)]
*  So maybe it would be way better. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=526.48s)]
*  No. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=528.36s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't have my kid. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=529.36s)]
*  Maybe I'd be a head of state or something. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=530.36s)]
*  Like if that one sperm had hit that one egg, I wouldn't have my son right now if my father [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=532.16s)]
*  was alive. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=535.6s)]
*  If anything happened differently. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=536.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=537.6s)]
*  All right, Ashton Kutcher. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=538.6s)]
*  That's the butterfly effect over here. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=539.6s)]
*  Guy watches one movie, all of a sudden he's just figured out. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=540.6s)]
*  Hey, you guys ever think maybe we're just plugged into a pod somewhere and this is all [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=541.6s)]
*  nothing? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=548.8000000000001s)]

*  I think there's something too that we're plugged into something. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=551.32s)]
*  It seems more like it every day. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=554.4s)]
*  It seems like this is like an advanced stage of the video game right now where like they're [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=556.44s)]
*  lighting cop cars on fire in L.A. and throwing bricks off of overpasses. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=560.32s)]

*  Nobody gets hurt. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=567.52s)]
*  It's just hilarious. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=568.52s)]
*  And I think it's directionally correct. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=569.52s)]
*  Like you probably start killing robots like you guys are on the right course. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=572.52s)]
*  They're early on the war of the machines. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=576.52s)]
*  Trying to stop the Terminator. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=579.52s)]
*  Bro, these are all going to be owned by corporations and it's going to be the only way you're [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=581.52s)]
*  allowed to get around because they're the safest. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=585.08s)]
*  They're going to take away everybody's driver's license. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=587.08s)]
*  It's going to get weird as fuck. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=589.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=591.76s)]
*  But it's going to probably be cars going to go 200 miles an hour. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=592.76s)]
*  Probably traffic will be eliminated. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=595.4s)]
*  I think they're going to be more of these fucking I've heard that we just saw in L.A. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=597.04s)]
*  That's what I've heard that teenagers are going back to smoking regular cigarettes now [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=600.68s)]

*  Bring back manual cars. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  I wonder if analog makes some sort of where it slows down because people want it to slow [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=610.68s)]
*  down a little bit. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=614.4s)]
*  Yeah, but it's too late. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=615.8s)]
*  They do want it to slow down. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=618.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the electric car didn't really take off the way they'd hoped. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=619.88s)]
*  Yeah, the problem with electric cars is the charging times too much. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=622.76s)]
*  It's too much. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=626.56s)]
*  If you're a young single woman and you have to charge your car and you have to just sit [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=627.56s)]
*  there for a fucking hour. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=630.64s)]
*  I also feel that way so I feel like you just call me a young single woman. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=632.04s)]
*  You're a man. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=635.72s)]
*  Any human is vulnerable. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=636.72s)]
*  But like a woman by herself is particularly vulnerable, right? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=639.16s)]
*  Like if you're a hot girl and you're sitting in your car, how many fucking creeps that [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=642.36s)]
*  know that you have to be there for an hour? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=646.48s)]

*  I almost rented a Tesla. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=656.0s)]
*  Get a large order and just walk down the aisle of Teslas waiting to find a hot one. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=657.84s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=661.7600000000001s)]
*  Have you ever driven a Tesla? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=662.7600000000001s)]

*  From the 70s. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=667.7600000000001s)]
*  Don't trust that electric shit. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=668.7600000000001s)]
*  I tried it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=669.7600000000001s)]
*  I was going to rent one once and they gave me the keys and I was like, this is going [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=670.7600000000001s)]
*  to be fun. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=672.4000000000001s)]
*  And then I remembered you have to charge it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=673.4000000000001s)]
*  I was like, I got to drive to fucking Rhode Island right now. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=675.0s)]

*  I think you can get there. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=680.64s)]
*  It's just then you have to charge it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=681.64s)]
*  No, I don't think we wouldn't have made it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=682.64s)]
*  No, it's like the real mileage is different than the mileage it says. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=684.64s)]
*  So it really should say like percentage of battery, but they want you to like estimate [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=689.2800000000001s)]
*  the mileage. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=692.6800000000001s)]
*  But it's all dependent upon how fast you're going. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=693.6800000000001s)]
*  Like if you're accelerating a lot, if you're moving around, if you just stop and go traffic, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=695.5600000000001s)]
*  like who knows what the real mileage is. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=699.6800000000001s)]
*  Say if you get stuck in a crazy traffic jam for like four hours, like some explosion somewhere [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=703.2s)]
*  and you supposedly have 200 miles on your car. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=709.2s)]
*  Is that good for four hours of you sitting there too with the radio on, with the air [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=712.9200000000001s)]
*  conditioning on? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=717.44s)]

*  Yeah, that happened in Chicago. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=726.9200000000001s)]
*  Remember when they had that fucking big thing where the highway got closed down and people [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  in Teslas were fucked man, because they just stopped working. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=731.16s)]
*  Also if you blow a tire, like Tesla has to come fix that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=735.04s)]
*  Really? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=738.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=739.1999999999999s)]

*  The function of Teslas though is amazing. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=743.1999999999999s)]

*  Yeah, no, that's a bunch of it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=773.66s)]
*  I get like road paralysis where like if I'm like driving for more than an hour and I'm [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=774.66s)]

*  It might be illegal what you've done. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=822.6800000000001s)]
*  No, it's not illegal. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  It's definitely, I will say it's a bad prank to do on a girl. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=824.6800000000001s)]
*  If this was a dude, if this was a dude, everyone would have been like, dude, great prank. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=827.44s)]
*  But because I did it to a girl, it was a little bit fucked up. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=833.96s)]
*  So we were at the mothership last time we were doing our podcast and our producer Alex [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=836.88s)]
*  is a girl and she's a big pothead, huge pothead, like real deal. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=841.32s)]
*  So as podcast producers are also a mother and a wonderful producer and a mother. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=845.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=850.36s)]
*  Better producer than mother. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=851.36s)]
*  No, she's great. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=852.36s)]
*  So I had the smelling salts and I was like, oh, these are fucking strong. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=853.36s)]

*  to go to Home Depot and we're going to arrest all the people at Home Depot, we're going [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1281.36s)]

*  That's crazy. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1299.44s)]
*  And then you've got this big protest that's scheduled for the 14th that's literally funded [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1302.44s)]
*  by the lady who owns Walmart. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1307.2s)]

*  Yeah, like criminals and rapists and you know, obviously, but then they go to like a college [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1318.0s)]
*  campus and there's some kid about to graduate. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1322.16s)]
*  They're like, no, you're out. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1323.88s)]
*  It's fucked up. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1325.44s)]

*  As always, the bricks, piles of bricks are showing up. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1355.24s)]
*  Like construction sites around the city. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1357.8s)]

*  man. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1374.04s)]

*  They have to hide under the overpass. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1383.24s)]
*  They're not the cops. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1384.24s)]

*  Yeah, it's attempted murder. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1389.24s)]
*  You could... [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1390.24s)]
*  You hit a fucking cinder block brick onto someone's head from an overpass, they're probably [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1391.24s)]
*  dead. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1396.36s)]

*  Well, you know what the problem is? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=1452.52s)]

*  And they're just going to keep spending insane amounts of money. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2414.84s)]
*  I feel like they're still spending. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2416.96s)]
*  They were like, hey, this is happening, but it's still going to continue to happen for [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2418.36s)]
*  the rest of your lives. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2420.96s)]

*  So it's a nonprofit that's funded by the government. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2454.52s)]
*  It's real weird stuff, man, when you find out about it. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2457.2799999999997s)]

*  I come on. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2466.96s)]
*  You do, but I actually assume because I didn't know about it until I started talking to Mike [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2467.96s)]
*  Benz about it. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2471.7200000000003s)]

*  Like how much money? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2473.7200000000003s)]
*  And when you find out where the money was going and what it was doing, it's like he [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2474.7200000000003s)]
*  said it's all for stuff that's too dirty for the CIA. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2477.68s)]
*  I was like, Jesus Christ. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2480.12s)]

*  of it all. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2487.12s)]

*  You want everybody out? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2529.96s)]
*  I feel like once you get in, let's take a test. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2531.84s)]
*  You know, like are you the type of guy that shows up at work? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2536.72s)]
*  Are you the type of guy that respects America? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2540.6s)]
*  Do you like being here? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2543.0s)]
*  Is it too easy to get in though? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2544.0s)]
*  Do you want a path? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2545.2s)]
*  You had a great analogy with the movie theater. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2546.2s)]
*  My movie theater analogy is killer. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2547.96s)]
*  It's a great analogy. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2549.68s)]
*  I said I've snuck into a movie before, sit in an empty seat and no one's taken. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2551.2s)]
*  It's not even taking up any kind of space. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2556.2799999999997s)]
*  If they come in and go, hey, where's your ticket? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2558.24s)]
*  I go, I don't have one. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2561.0s)]

*  You gotta go, man. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2564.64s)]
*  I can't be like, ah, dude, I've already watched an hour of it. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2565.64s)]
*  So what? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2569.52s)]
*  And I feel like you should let them finish the movie. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2570.52s)]
*  That's a good... [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2572.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm just saying my point. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2573.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm not even saying you shouldn't let... [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2574.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm saying it's discretion to let them finish the movie or not. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2575.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm just making the point to be like blowing away. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2578.08s)]
*  They shoot you with a rocket bullet. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2580.08s)]
*  But I'm like, what? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2581.08s)]
*  This movie theater was built on my people's land. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2582.44s)]
*  To me it's just like a weird reaction to getting caught being like, well, but I've already [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2585.92s)]
*  been here. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2590.44s)]
*  It's like, I've gotten away with it for so long. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2591.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of funny. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2592.84s)]
*  If you steal someone's stuff and they find it 20 years later, you go, well, it's been [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2593.84s)]
*  mine for 20 years. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2597.6s)]
*  But also, I totally agree with you. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2599.72s)]
*  And it's a funny joke. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2602.04s)]
*  But also, if you're living in Mexico and you're a young person and you figure out a way to [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2603.2799999999997s)]
*  sneak across the border, you get gainfully employed in the United States. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2607.56s)]
*  You start doing well. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2611.56s)]
*  You're involved in a business. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2613.2799999999997s)]
*  You start raising a family. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2614.84s)]
*  But there's no real path to citizenship because you snuck in. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2616.42s)]
*  But you've actually become integrated in society and you're part of the American dream. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2618.64s)]
*  Sure. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2623.2s)]
*  It's just there's no path if you're dirt poor. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2624.2s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2625.96s)]
*  See, if you're living in Denmark and you're white and you got a college degree and you're [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2626.96s)]
*  really good at genetics, you want to come over here and work for a lab, probably not [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2630.08s)]
*  that hard. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2632.92s)]
*  You got to jump through hoops though. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2633.92s)]
*  You got to meet with the guy every six months or whatever it is. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2634.92s)]
*  You got to fill out the paperwork. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2637.0s)]
*  But if you're walking here from Mexico, there's no clear path to citizenship. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2638.0s)]
*  You got to marry a fat white woman. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2644.0s)]
*  That's the path. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2647.0s)]
*  Fine. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2648.0s)]
*  Fine, desperado. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2649.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2650.0s)]
*  I mean, there's no clear path. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2651.0s)]
*  And especially if you're integrated into like, there was a guy that I had that was my landscaper [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2653.04s)]
*  for a long time in LA. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2658.2000000000003s)]
*  He was Danish. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2660.76s)]
*  He's Dutch. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2661.76s)]
*  He came from Mexico. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2663.52s)]
*  He walked across from Mexico. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2664.6800000000003s)]
*  He lived in these communities. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2667.48s)]
*  He took me to, they had chicken fights in their communities. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2668.92s)]
*  This dude had just roosters stacked up everywhere. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2672.76s)]
*  There was like a hundred roosters in this guy's backyard. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2675.6800000000003s)]
*  Not my landscaper, but his friend. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2679.1600000000003s)]
*  He took me to his friend's place. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2680.44s)]
*  They would barbecue a goat and cook root. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2681.56s)]
*  There was an English speaking sign for blocks. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2683.7200000000003s)]
*  And I was like, this is- [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2688.1600000000003s)]
*  You should have fucking paid him more. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2689.1600000000003s)]
*  So my point is, I don't know. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2690.1600000000003s)]
*  That was not my point. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2693.1600000000003s)]
*  My point is like- [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2694.44s)]
*  Spent it all on chicken fights. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2695.44s)]
*  There's like completely integrated societies that are a part of LA that are fully Mexican. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2696.44s)]
*  But it functions. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2704.04s)]
*  It works. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2705.04s)]
*  Like going in and raiding those people and putting them in jail because they've integrated [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2706.04s)]
*  into society in an illegal way. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2710.92s)]
*  It seems stupid. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2713.64s)]
*  And then to all the people that are going, it's like, is my tax dollars, like guys, the [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2714.64s)]
*  amount of bullshit that our tax dollars goes to, that should be a priority over getting [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2717.08s)]

*  Joe, it sounds like you just want to keep barbecued goat in this country. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2724.52s)]
*  Well, here's the problem. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2726.84s)]
*  The problem is if they're illegal, right, which is what everybody wants to keep it that [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2727.84s)]
*  way, because whatever you let them vote. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2731.92s)]
*  If they're illegal, then you don't have to pay them as much. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2734.04s)]
*  And this is where it's dark. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2738.36s)]
*  This is the dark secret of why people want cheap labor in this country because there's [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2739.84s)]
*  a lot of people that don't pay people what they're supposed to be getting paid. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2743.88s)]
*  It's non-union. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2746.92s)]
*  They're illegal. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2748.2400000000002s)]
*  Everyone knows. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2749.2400000000002s)]
*  And they want cheap labor. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2750.7400000000002s)]
*  Cheap, dependable, reliable labor. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2752.56s)]
*  So they let people in for that. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2754.4s)]
*  Tim Dillon was talking to me about this a long time ago because he used to be a real [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2756.32s)]
*  estate guy. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2759.62s)]
*  He understands the dynamics of it all. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2760.62s)]
*  That is a big part of what they want, why they're bringing people in. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2763.0s)]
*  But the reality is, yeah, you should just pay people more money. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2765.96s)]
*  You should make less money. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2770.74s)]
*  You should pay them more money. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2771.84s)]
*  You should pay them enough money so they can live. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2772.84s)]
*  To try to have a giant business that pays people the least amount possible is kind of [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2776.04s)]
*  crazy. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2781.12s)]
*  I know, but it's kind of crazy. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=2782.68s)]

*  And then a lot of people were getting syphilis. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3023.04s)]
*  These people were freaks. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3025.26s)]
*  They were all fucking each other. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3026.26s)]

*  Syphilis is crazy. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3030.56s)]
*  It rots your head away. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3031.56s)]

*  Literally, it's horrific shit. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3038.3599999999997s)]

*  It comes from these freaks that all had syphilis that were all banging each other in France. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3046.08s)]
*  And if you have money, you're fucking just getting pussy left and right. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3050.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3052.68s)]
*  So there was these two guys that were royals and they started it all. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3053.68s)]
*  They started wearing the wigs when they got syphilis. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3058.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3061.24s)]

*  They're all missing a kidney as well. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3134.74s)]
*  So they went down to Turkey to get a bypass, a gastric bypass, and they stole their fucking [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3135.9s)]
*  kidneys. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3140.46s)]

*  He does it to fans. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3265.14s)]
*  He hits them with a liver shot. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3266.14s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3267.14s)]
*  They ask him. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3268.14s)]
*  Liver shot and bare knuckle. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3269.62s)]
*  Ilya Tupori, a bare knuckle liver shotting people. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3270.62s)]
*  I'd rather be punching the face 10 out of 10 times. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3273.62s)]
*  But Mickey said when he lost to Diego Sanchez it was because his kidneys started shutting [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3275.8199999999997s)]
*  off. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3279.06s)]
*  That's why he bit him. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3280.06s)]
*  I bet that is a weight loss thing. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3281.06s)]
*  He said it's from weight loss. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3282.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's a brutal thing that they do, man. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3283.06s)]
*  Like Kayla Harrison who just won the Bantamweight title. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3285.3799999999997s)]
*  Oh, that picture of her weigh in. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3287.58s)]
*  She's so big. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3290.02s)]
*  She's so jacked. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3291.7799999999997s)]
*  And her getting down to 135, I don't know how much weight she's losing. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3292.9s)]
*  I don't really want to ask, but I do. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3296.74s)]
*  You know, you're not supposed to ask ladies what their weight. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3298.8999999999996s)]
*  She was competing in the Olympics. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3302.02s)]
*  Deviated professional fighting. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3303.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3304.02s)]
*  And when she was over at the PFL she was fighting at 155. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3305.02s)]
*  Her picture of her at the actual weigh in was like scary. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3309.1s)]
*  Yeah it's kind of fucked up. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3314.3399999999997s)]
*  It was like a thumbnail from like crack whore confessions. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3315.3399999999997s)]
*  See this is the problem. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3318.5s)]
*  The UFC had a 145 pound division and Amanda Nunes was the champion of it. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3319.5s)]
*  For the health of both fighters, that would be a good way. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3325.18s)]
*  It really depends on if Kayla Harrison can continue to make 135 and defend the title [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3328.02s)]
*  because I don't know who's going to beat her. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3332.1s)]
*  She's too fucking strong. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3333.8999999999996s)]
*  Huge. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3334.8999999999996s)]
*  She's so strong. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3335.8999999999996s)]
*  That was a lot with the chicks. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3336.8999999999996s)]
*  There's like a real dominant chick for a while. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3337.8999999999996s)]
*  With Amanda it was KO power. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3339.62s)]
*  Amanda was one of the rare women that she could just touch you and just blast you out in orbit. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3341.66s)]
*  Usually with women it's like combination punches. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3347.7s)]
*  Amanda had extraordinary power. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3350.2599999999998s)]
*  When she knocked out Cyborg, that was wild dude. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3352.66s)]
*  She just folded Cyborg. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3355.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm like that lady can crack. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3357.1s)]
*  Was it Silva? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3360.02s)]
*  This last weekend there was a knockout. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3361.2599999999998s)]
*  The guy was asleep standing and it was the most softest look. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3363.1s)]
*  Turnover. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3367.02s)]
*  Turnover like chin punching. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3368.02s)]
*  The Korean dude. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3369.5s)]
*  The boxer. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3370.5s)]
*  Yeah young. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3371.5s)]
*  He was like 23 years old. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3372.5s)]
*  Joe Sang Yoo. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3373.5s)]
*  He moved and it was the smallest little knock. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3374.5s)]
*  He didn't pull it from the shoulder or nothing. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3377.42s)]
*  One of the best left hooks of all time. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3379.3399999999997s)]
*  The guy was asleep before he hit the ground. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3380.3399999999997s)]
*  One of the best left hooks of all time. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3382.22s)]
*  It was literally like this. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3383.8199999999997s)]
*  Bam. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3384.8199999999997s)]
*  He just turned it over. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3385.8199999999997s)]
*  He's a kid right? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3386.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah he's young. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3387.8199999999997s)]
*  No he's not that young. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3388.8199999999997s)]
*  No no no. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3389.8199999999997s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3390.8199999999997s)]

*  Look at that. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3392.8199999999997s)]
*  I think he's 28. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3393.8199999999997s)]
*  It's a lot of his momentum coming in too. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3394.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like the perfect place timing. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3395.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3396.8199999999997s)]
*  For sure. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3397.8199999999997s)]
*  But he's also a really good boxer. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3398.8199999999997s)]
*  You get knocked out and then some dudes doing back flips in the ring. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3399.8199999999997s)]
*  That sucks. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3400.8199999999997s)]
*  That's the worst feeling in the world. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3401.8199999999997s)]
*  By the way I'm not a good enough sport for if I was knocked out and they come over and [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3402.8199999999997s)]
*  start doing that thing where they're touching my face a lot and be like thank you for the [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3407.1s)]
*  opportunity. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3410.02s)]

*  I guess god thought I was training wrong. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3433.66s)]
*  This lady's got a problem because if she, you know, other than the Amanda Nunes fight, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3438.5s)]
*  who? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3443.1400000000003s)]

*  You know like if she can continue to make 135 if she becomes a marathon runner or something [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3446.82s)]
*  and drops even more muscle mass and can make 135 who the fuck is going to be able to deal [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3451.38s)]
*  with that? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3455.7000000000003s)]
*  It was like Mike Tyson back in the day. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3456.7000000000003s)]
*  It became a thing where they started like offering you money back on the pay per views [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3457.7000000000003s)]
*  if he didn't last at least two rounds. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3461.1400000000003s)]
*  Did they? [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3464.0200000000004s)]
*  Yeah that was the whole thing. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3465.0200000000004s)]
*  He was knocking people out so fast it was like, I'm not paying for this. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3466.78s)]
*  Yeah everybody would look at a pay per view based on how long you thought the fight would [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3470.02s)]
*  last like $60. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3473.14s)]
*  Man. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3474.14s)]
*  It wasn't that much back then. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3475.14s)]
*  But I remember people being bummed out. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3478.14s)]
*  It was like a 30 second knockout. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3479.94s)]
*  But it was also fun to like, it was almost like Mike Tyson, his thing was he was so vicious [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3481.34s)]
*  and badass. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3486.54s)]

*  You know? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3490.38s)]
*  Yeah but also the crazy. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3491.38s)]
*  I remember UFC people, they want the back and forth, they want five crazy fights, they [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3492.7400000000002s)]
*  want to like, you feel like you're getting your money's worth. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3496.86s)]

*  driving around that night afterwards listening to the radio and people were like, tons of [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3503.7000000000003s)]
*  complaining on sports radio. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3507.9s)]
*  I'm like, you just watched a guy bite another man's ear off. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3509.1s)]
*  You would pay $60 just for that. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3512.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah before the fight if they were like, watch a man eat another man's ear. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3515.46s)]
*  I'll pay anything you want. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3518.54s)]
*  Did he bite him twice? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3520.26s)]
*  Yeah, he didn't get it off the first time though. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3522.1s)]
*  The money back was for that fight. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3524.1s)]
*  The fact that Mike Tyson has... [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3525.1s)]
*  $50 back then? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3527.1s)]
*  Wow. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3528.1s)]
*  His edibles that are ear shaped is one of the funniest fucking things on earth. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3529.1s)]
*  And the fact that they're friends now. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3531.74s)]
*  Van Der Holif has no idea what's going on. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3533.22s)]
*  He doesn't? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3536.8999999999996s)]
*  He'd be friends with anybody. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3537.8999999999996s)]
*  He is Gonski. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3538.8999999999996s)]
*  Van Der Holif? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3539.8999999999996s)]
*  Is he? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3540.8999999999996s)]
*  Oh, he yells a whisper. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3541.8999999999996s)]
*  He was on my podcast a few years back. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3542.8999999999996s)]
*  Really? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3545.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3546.8999999999996s)]
*  Back in LA. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3547.8999999999996s)]
*  He was super coherent back in LA. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3549.06s)]
*  Damn. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3552.06s)]
*  I mean that was a few years ago. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3553.06s)]
*  Seven years ago maybe. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3555.7400000000002s)]
*  How long ago was Evander on the show? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3556.7400000000002s)]
*  Did he fight Vitor? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3557.7400000000002s)]
*  Is that who fought Vitor? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3558.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3559.7400000000002s)]
*  That was unfortunate. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3560.7400000000002s)]
*  That was a bad fight. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3561.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't think he had a real camp for that fight either. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3562.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3564.34s)]
*  I think that was a last minute replacement because Vitor was supposed to fight somebody [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3565.34s)]
*  else, right? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3568.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3569.42s)]
*  Very few athletes will ever I think at this point... [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3570.42s)]
*  I know there's bigger contracts now than ever. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3573.6600000000003s)]
*  2019. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3575.6600000000003s)]
*  So six years ago. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3576.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't think a few athletes will ever understand the idea of what those guys' lives were like. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3578.42s)]
*  You know like Riddick Bowe? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3582.62s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3583.62s)]
*  Riddick Bowe was champion for two fights. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3584.62s)]
*  And he was awesome. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3586.62s)]
*  He was awesome. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3587.62s)]
*  But he didn't have a long run or anything. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3588.62s)]
*  And then you see his thing. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3590.8599999999997s)]
*  It's like 14 acres with white tigers everywhere and all his clothes are silk. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3592.14s)]
*  They were just getting handed like $50 million in one night. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3597.1s)]
*  I know it's like he trained for that night, but that's a crazy amount of money. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3602.7799999999997s)]
*  I know athletes get that. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3606.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3608.02s)]
*  Well it's... [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3609.02s)]
*  Like anymore. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3610.02s)]
*  Nothing like that. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3611.02s)]
*  There's a few. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3612.02s)]
*  Canelo does. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3613.02s)]
*  Does he? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3614.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3615.02s)]
*  Canelo has a giant deal with the side. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3616.02s)]
*  Oh but I mean maybe even boxing still has that with the pay per view like taken. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3617.02s)]
*  I just mean... [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3618.02s)]
*  Yeah some of these boxers are making pretty fucking nuts. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3619.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3620.42s)]
*  But that sport's the only sport... [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3621.42s)]
*  I mean UFC has never paid like that has it? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3622.42s)]
*  I don't know what the most amount anyone's been paid in the UFC for a fight. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3625.46s)]
*  If I had to guess it's got to be Conor. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3630.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3632.1s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3633.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3634.1s)]
*  Conor has made more than $100 million in the UFC I believe. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3635.2599999999998s)]
*  See if that's a fact. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3638.2599999999998s)]
*  Is that going all in with his endorsement? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3640.66s)]
*  I shouldn't say that because I don't really know. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3642.58s)]
*  I just read some article that tried to break down how much he made for each pay per view [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3644.5s)]
*  and how much he made at the beginning of his career. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3648.2s)]
*  You know like when he first burst onto the scene. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3650.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3653.98s)]
*  It's a... [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3654.98s)]
*  I got two numbers in the first results. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3655.98s)]
*  That says 39.3 and then down here says 108. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3658.14s)]
*  108. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3661.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3662.62s)]
*  That's... [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3663.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3664.62s)]
*  So there's like the pay per view bonuses versus like fight pay. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3665.62s)]
*  What I was going to say is I thought he made $100 million from the Floyd fight. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3668.62s)]
*  So it can't be that. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3672.42s)]
*  So 30 million... [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3675.54s)]
*  Oh it says 30 million from the boxing match in Floyd. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3676.54s)]
*  I thought it was 100 million. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3679.8199999999997s)]
*  And his biggest pay was against Khabib for 28.5 almost? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3681.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3684.8599999999997s)]
*  So 28 million. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3686.2999999999997s)]
*  He's probably made the most. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3687.9s)]
*  But his like... [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3689.7s)]
*  If I had to guess... [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3690.7s)]
*  That was all pay per view bonus. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3691.7s)]
*  That's a huge pay per view. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3692.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3693.7799999999997s)]
*  But he did get paid. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3694.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean that's the only way they get paid anyway. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3695.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah of course. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3697.98s)]
*  I mean the pay per view bonus thing is great because it forces them to promote but I don't [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3698.98s)]
*  mind a silent killer. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3705.18s)]
*  I don't mind an Alex Pereira. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3706.7s)]
*  I don't want to see him promoted. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3708.1s)]
*  He don't have to promote. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3709.66s)]
*  That dude promotes when he puts people into orbit. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3710.66s)]
*  You know just let him train. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3712.74s)]
*  Let him shoot a fucking bow and arrow at a soccer ball. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3713.8599999999997s)]
*  Let him train. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3716.06s)]
*  Like don't fucking pawn that guy out and have him do media everywhere. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3717.06s)]
*  Like leave his energy alone. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3723.46s)]
*  You guys can do enough with promotion from his highlight reel. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3724.46s)]
*  But the guy like Connor though? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3727.34s)]
*  That fucking guy like... [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3729.94s)]
*  If he can get on the radio, if he can get on a talk show, if he can start talking shit, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3730.94s)]
*  the number... [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3735.7s)]
*  Dana sees dollar bills like fucking Scrooge McDuck. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3736.7s)]
*  He's like throwing gold coins in the air. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3738.94s)]
*  Connor was the best at it. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3742.7s)]
*  What about a couple weeks ago Aaron Blanchfield versus... [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3743.98s)]
*  What was the girl she was fighting? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3747.46s)]
*  Macy Barber. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3749.66s)]
*  They canceled it as it was starting. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3750.66s)]
*  They already did the package for the main event and then they found out that Macy Barber [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3752.8199999999997s)]
*  had passed out. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3756.98s)]
*  She had a seizure backstage. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3757.98s)]
*  I don't want to speak out of turn. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3759.8599999999997s)]
*  So it's some sort of medical condition and she was in trouble. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3761.3399999999997s)]
*  And so they sent her to the hospital to get checked out. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3764.62s)]
*  I mean they literally said, all right now it's time for the main event. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3766.66s)]
*  And then they were like, well never mind. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3769.46s)]
*  We're not doing it. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3770.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3771.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't, again, I don't want to speak out of turn. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3772.7799999999997s)]
*  But I think she might have had some health concerns. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3773.7799999999997s)]
*  She's had a bunch of health concerns over the last couple of years, I think. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3776.26s)]
*  So and then she missed weight, which is never a good sign. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3780.34s)]
*  You know, when they miss weight usually something's off. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3783.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3784.9s)]
*  A lot of times they're injured or sick or something. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3785.9s)]
*  But whatever it was, it sucks. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3788.1000000000004s)]
*  That sucks for Aaron Blanchfield. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3790.42s)]
*  She's actually from my hometown in Jersey. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3792.5400000000004s)]
*  She's a beast dude. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3794.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, she's a monster. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3795.2200000000003s)]
*  Very good. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3796.2200000000003s)]
*  Very young too. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3797.2200000000003s)]
*  Were you going to sit him up and say something shitty about her and then be like, I know [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3798.2200000000003s)]
*  her actually really well. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3799.3s)]
*  She's a dumb bitch. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3800.3s)]
*  Oh, I grew up with her. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3801.3s)]
*  What an ass. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3802.3s)]
*  I was with Dave Porterfield. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3803.34s)]
*  You know, he's a big fan of Meatball, Molly McCann, who's great too. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3804.6600000000003s)]
*  But he's like, I'm betting on Molly and I go, yeah. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3810.6600000000003s)]
*  And he's like, you think? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3814.7000000000003s)]
*  I go, dude, like Aaron Blanchfield is the truth. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3815.7000000000003s)]
*  Like she's a fucking problem. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3819.02s)]
*  She's a problem. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3821.2200000000003s)]
*  She gets a hold of Molly and she just rag dolled her. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3822.2200000000003s)]
*  If you were going to Pete Rose your own sport, how do you think you would hit good? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3824.38s)]
*  Oh, I used to bet on it. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3828.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3830.42s)]
*  But I can't affect the outcome. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3831.42s)]
*  So I used in the early days of the UFC when they first started having lines and sports [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3832.54s)]
*  books, I'd bet because I would see like you'd see shit like Anderson Silva is like if this [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3836.26s)]
*  isn't an 800 to one versus Travis Luthor, like, OK, that was that was different. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3841.58s)]
*  OK, Travis Luthor lost that fight, in my opinion, because he cut too much weight. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3849.38s)]
*  You think he was on the fight? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3854.3s)]
*  He was he had him mounted early in the fight. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3855.7000000000003s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3857.7400000000002s)]
*  Travis Luthor's Brazilian Jiu Jitsu was fucking elite. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3858.7400000000002s)]
*  All the guys that I know that train with them like go, dude, he's like Ricardo [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3861.66s)]
*  Liborio level. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3866.02s)]
*  They're like he's special. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3867.06s)]
*  Like he he did the ultimate fighter and everybody was terrified. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3868.2599999999998s)]
*  And they're like, that motherfucker gets you on the ground. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3871.58s)]
*  You're in trouble. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3873.38s)]
*  Yeah. He's just a machine in Jiu Jitsu. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3874.38s)]
*  So I saw him cut weight and he looked so bad, his lips were cracked. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3877.06s)]
*  Well, his face was sucked in and he was shuffling to the scale and he still didn't make [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3881.86s)]
*  weight. He never made weight. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3887.06s)]
*  Oh, is that what happened? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3888.46s)]
*  It wasn't a title fight. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3889.34s)]
*  That's right. Yeah. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3890.38s)]
*  Won the title if he won. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3891.1s)]
*  That's crazy. They used to give the winner of the ultimate fighter a title shot like [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3892.18s)]
*  back in the day. It was like a crazy like just sort of like prize. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3895.42s)]
*  Like it's just change. It's just more of a legitimate sport now that you can't just [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3899.7s)]
*  give like the winner of a reality show a title. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3904.02s)]
*  America's Got Talent used to give a million dollar prize. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3906.1s)]
*  And then one day they just changed. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3908.42s)]
*  Like you just be part of an America's Got Talent show in Vegas. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3909.58s)]
*  Do they always give you a title fight? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3912.5s)]
*  Is that I think the first few seasons? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3914.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think Travis had had a few fights in the UFC before that, dude. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3916.02s)]
*  That was long after the ultimate fighter. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3919.82s)]
*  I'm about 90 percent sure because I know he knocked out Marvin Eastman. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3923.62s)]
*  I remember that fight. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3927.38s)]
*  And, you know, he fought quite a few dudes. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3928.5s)]
*  But the main theme was when Travis got a hold of you, you were fucked. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3930.94s)]
*  And he got a hold of Anderson and Anderson looked. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3935.06s)]
*  It was early in the fight. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3937.18s)]
*  But then he got Anderson, got him in a triangle. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3938.1s)]
*  He just tired out and Anderson was blasting him. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3940.06s)]
*  Anderson was what he first came in. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3942.06s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3943.42s)]
*  If you saw that guy the day before, you'd go, oh, my God, how is this guy even a lie? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3944.54s)]
*  He should be taken to a hospital. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3949.14s)]
*  He looked so bad. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3950.7s)]
*  I've seen a lot of people weigh in looking really bad. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3952.18s)]
*  But Travis was the worst. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3955.06s)]
*  So look at this. He's mounted on top of Anderson early in the fight. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3957.74s)]
*  Wow. I mean, I just kept the head. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3960.98s)]
*  He had him. He was mounted for like two and a half minutes. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3963.18s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, but he just gassed out. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3965.1s)]
*  And I mean, he just had nothing left. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3967.8599999999997s)]
*  He lost too much weight, man. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3970.5s)]
*  And so then Anderson got him in a triangle and started fucking him up with elbows. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3973.46s)]
*  So they came a point in time where you could see him visibly fading. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3976.98s)]
*  You know, yeah, I think if you look at that mount, bro, look how slick that is. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3980.94s)]
*  I mean, this dude is so slick. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3985.8199999999997s)]
*  Travis was so dangerous, man. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3988.1s)]
*  He could have possibly submitted him, but he was just too big for the weight class. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3990.3399999999997s)]
*  He shouldn't have been making that weight. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3994.3799999999997s)]
*  So that's that's my point. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3996.02s)]
*  It's like, yeah, he was a live dog in this fight, is my point. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=3997.5s)]
*  Yeah, he was tired. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4001.2599999999998s)]
*  That wasn't even really an escape that Anderson did. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4002.22s)]
*  He lost way too much weight. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4004.14s)]
*  Dude, he was dead the day before. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4005.22s)]
*  I mean, dead when I saw him dead. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4006.74s)]
*  He looked like he might die. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4009.14s)]
*  Have you ever gotten to talk to a fighter about the psychology of like. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4010.9s)]
*  Once you lose, like when you're just like this dominant force [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4014.46s)]
*  and once you lose, like your whole thing change, like Roy Jones Jr. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4016.66s)]
*  was overnight, overnight, overnight. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4019.7799999999997s)]
*  They said that one guy called him out, said he was talking to him. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4021.8199999999997s)]
*  You know, Tarver Tarver said he was talking to him. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4023.8599999999997s)]
*  Then he told him to ever beat him. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4025.5s)]
*  Then Glenn Johnson just beat him, knocked him through the ropes. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4026.98s)]
*  It was just like it became like, you just beat him. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4029.2599999999998s)]
*  But Glenn Johnson knocked him out, whereas one of those scary ones [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4031.22s)]
*  where your arms are stiff. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4034.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4035.6600000000003s)]
*  And it didn't seem like he hit him that hard either. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4036.54s)]
*  That was it couldn't be real that it was happening. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4039.42s)]
*  It was like two fights before that was the fight was the fight. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4041.42s)]
*  I believe he's hitting the guy and he tells the ref, he's like, stop the fight. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4044.0600000000004s)]
*  And then the ref didn't. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4047.26s)]
*  And he hit him a few more times. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4048.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4049.3s)]
*  Like that was like two fights before. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4050.46s)]
*  It was just all over. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4052.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. But you know what happened? [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4053.6600000000003s)]
*  Roy went up to heavyweight and he fought John Ruiz. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4055.34s)]
*  And then he dropped back down to light heavyweight. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4058.86s)]
*  And that's a real problem. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4061.1000000000004s)]
*  There's like he got knocked out. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4062.82s)]
*  So he was like, he's stiff, dude. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4064.14s)]
*  Like when you get knocked down and you're just like stiff here. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4067.3399999999997s)]
*  Oh, Anderson Silva. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4071.1s)]
*  That's so awful. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4073.06s)]
*  Wasn't it pretty much Anderson Silva after the leg went in the fight? [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4073.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4077.1s)]
*  It was just like he never really got one fight since, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4077.3799999999997s)]
*  but he never really captured back like we're just going to watch him. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4079.2999999999997s)]
*  We went first UFC we ever went to was 101 in Philly. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4082.18s)]
*  Anderson Silva versus Forrest Griffin. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4085.3799999999997s)]
*  Forrest Griffin. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4087.14s)]
*  And a racist ass Philly crowd. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4087.8199999999997s)]
*  Forrest is coming out. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4089.94s)]
*  That night for us in general was just a hilarious thing. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4091.22s)]

*  This is back, look, this is back the day when I was younger. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4124.54s)]
*  It's like if you become friends with a girl, like you can't separate. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4126.82s)]
*  No one's going to see her. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4129.86s)]
*  You don't have to over explain it. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4130.9s)]
*  You fuck the girl that wasn't. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4132.14s)]
*  She was really hot. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4133.14s)]
*  I mean, it's OK. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4133.82s)]
*  Look, you know, I'm saying now I wouldn't have dated her. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4136.3s)]
*  But yeah, she was a little bit of a chunkier girl. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4138.7s)]
*  And whatever it was that we were just we were just talking shit, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4141.1s)]
*  like watching the fights. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4144.94s)]
*  Everyone's just being animals. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4146.0199999999995s)]
*  We end up getting to a thing with these guys in front of us. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4147.5s)]
*  It was like it was maybe four of us. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4150.139999999999s)]
*  And I want to say maybe three of them. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4152.86s)]
*  We might have outnumbered them. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4154.339999999999s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4155.86s)]
*  At first, it was just there was like one or two guys just there. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4156.66s)]
*  The other guys were gone. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4159.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we were just like a coyote trap. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4159.94s)]
*  They show you one of the rest of them surround you. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4162.379999999999s)]
*  And we we started talking shit with these guys. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4164.58s)]
*  It just turned into like, you know, I mean, we shouldn't make this. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4166.62s)]
*  We're not looking. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4169.86s)]
*  None of us are looking for trouble, guys. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4170.94s)]
*  The guys were I think we were talking and saying shit, like being funny. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4172.82s)]
*  And I think they kind of were giving us like a bunch. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4176.459999999999s)]
*  You guys shut the fuck up. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4179.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we're being dickhead comedians and they're like really serious [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4180.26s)]
*  about watching MMA fight right now. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4184.18s)]
*  First, whatever in Philadelphia. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4186.02s)]
*  They turned around, they start talking shit. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4187.62s)]
*  So then we start talking shit to them. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4189.34s)]
*  We kind of chumped the two guys and then their group of friends show up [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4190.5s)]
*  and they get wind that they just got chumped by these fucking loser. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4193.46s)]
*  They left the nerds behind and they went and got merch. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4197.26s)]
*  Yeah. So then these guys make the nerds get merged. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4200.1s)]
*  We see what we're working with. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4202.820000000001s)]
*  I became a whole argument. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4204.1s)]
*  These guys started talking shit to us. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4205.1s)]
*  And by the way, we were above them. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4206.66s)]
*  We could have fucked it. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4208.18s)]
*  We should have just higher ground. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4208.9s)]
*  We should have just dominated these guys. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4210.58s)]
*  But whatever had happened, we just didn't want to fight and get kicked out. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4212.54s)]
*  We're not like tough guys like that. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4215.5s)]
*  So they start talking shit. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4217.259999999999s)]
*  And then this is like it's such a fight. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4218.379999999999s)]
*  It's almost like when somebody spits on you, one of the guys goes, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4219.9s)]
*  it was like, you'll fuck you and fuck your fat bitch, too. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4222.98s)]
*  But the girl that I was seeing and we all just acted like we didn't hear it. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4225.339999999999s)]
*  I didn't hear it. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4229.0199999999995s)]
*  We just communally agree without even looking at each other. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4230.259999999999s)]
*  We're like, oh, these guys, huh? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4232.0199999999995s)]
*  She said the rest of the night, I can't believe these guys were ready [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4235.66s)]
*  to fight for everything except me. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4237.86s)]
*  When that was the final vote, he goes, oh, well, you should stick up for yourself, lady. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4239.62s)]
*  And then we just sat there. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4243.139999999999s)]
*  She's a big girl. She could have helped. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4244.46s)]
*  Then we went outside and pretended like we were waiting to find them as a sea of 18,000 people. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4246.099999999999s)]
*  God, we suck, boy. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4249.86s)]
*  We did look like jerk offs there. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4251.74s)]
*  But then that was so funny because it was Philly, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4254.82s)]
*  which historically hilariously racist city. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4257.74s)]
*  And which fight was that? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4260.099999999999s)]
*  It was Forrest Griffin, Anderson Silva. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4261.46s)]
*  Oh, that was crazy. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4263.299999999999s)]
*  Forrest Griffin. I mean, the applause. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4264.66s)]
*  When he came out, the ovation he got, they couldn't wait. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4267.26s)]
*  They loved him. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4269.46s)]
*  And they literally booed Anderson Silva. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4270.22s)]
*  And then Anderson Silva handled that hilariously and quick. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4274.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4277.780000000001s)]
*  And then when Forrest Griffin left immediately, he didn't stay. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4278.780000000001s)]
*  He ran right out of the ring, which was a thing. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4282.780000000001s)]
*  And then they announced the thing, goes, you're winner. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4284.9400000000005s)]
*  And still Anderson Silva. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4287.660000000001s)]
*  And the place booed. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4289.46s)]
*  It was such a sweet moment because Anderson Silva seems like his personality is good. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4290.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4294.06s)]
*  And they were like booing. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4295.7s)]
*  And they had him on the big screen. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4296.34s)]
*  And Anderson Silva goes like, you almost had to go, really? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4297.38s)]
*  And he's holding the belt. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4300.099999999999s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, all right, you son of a bitch. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4300.98s)]
*  That was amazing. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4303.099999999999s)]
*  And they cheered for him. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4303.9s)]
*  Come on, man. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4304.82s)]
*  Strange. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4305.86s)]
*  We saw an 18-year-old or 19-year-old, John Jones, just walking around the arena that night. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4306.62s)]
*  And I didn't know. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4310.98s)]
*  I got into UFC way early. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4313.0199999999995s)]
*  Me and my step-pop used to get like, you know, Ninja versus sumo wrestler UFC. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4315.74s)]
*  And then when it got like rules and everyone was kind of like, you know, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4320.34s)]
*  trying to start doing like actual MMA, I lost track of it. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4324.3s)]
*  And Lewis and Dave were super into it. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4328.46s)]
*  So you guys walk around. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4330.1s)]
*  That's funny when the rules came, you checked out. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4331.06s)]
*  Checked out. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4333.02s)]
*  Me and Dave, we became friends. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4334.42s)]
*  We were roommates in Brooklyn. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4336.18s)]
*  We would go to the blockbuster, rent the old UFCs. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4337.5s)]
*  It was like ultimate knockouts, ultimate submissions. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4340.18s)]
*  They had like a series of videos. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4342.34s)]
*  And who was it? [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4344.22s)]
*  Mark Lehman. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4345.46s)]
*  He would teach you how to do moves. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4346.02s)]
*  Like in the, there was like a segment where it's like, hey, kids at home. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4347.46s)]
*  Cheers to you. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4350.780000000001s)]
*  So me and Dave, literally living in the shittiest, dirtiest apartment with a [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4352.74s)]
*  garbage everywhere and beer bottles everywhere, we would have grappling [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4356.62s)]
*  matches with our buddy, Wes. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4360.0199999999995s)]
*  My cauliflower year didn't come from jujitsu. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4362.0599999999995s)]
*  This is from Dave Smith. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4363.86s)]
*  He would literally open hand smack. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4365.5s)]
*  We had open hand smacking rules. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4367.82s)]
*  He would open hand smack me in the ear. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4369.5s)]
*  Political pun. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4371.82s)]
*  Maybe the best political pun in the world. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4372.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4374.179999999999s)]
*  This is who Dave was. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4374.86s)]
*  I'm going to assassinate him. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4375.42s)]
*  Dave was a pothead wigger who was grappling amongst garbage with me. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4376.22s)]
*  That's so funny. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4379.94s)]
*  That's how he started his career. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4380.42s)]
*  Guess what was on my couch for a couple of years. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4380.86s)]
*  Did you guys ever imagine he was going to be that good at like political commentary? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4382.66s)]
*  I, you know what? [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4386.179999999999s)]
*  I shouldn't say no. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4386.9s)]
*  I didn't know he was going to go to be that kind of big in it. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4388.0599999999995s)]
*  The fact that he is great at it doesn't surprise me at all. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4392.099999999999s)]
*  But it's, it's, it's interesting how like, cause I said, this was just a guy at a [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4394.58s)]
*  time I said we smoked pot. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4399.66s)]
*  We essentially raised my daughter off a gay couple during the day. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4401.38s)]
*  Then my ex-wife would come home and then we head into the city and meet up with [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4404.0599999999995s)]
*  Lewis. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4407.7s)]

*  You're weird. That town is England. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4727.0199999999995s)]
*  That town needs a Mexican uprising, it sounds like. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4729.26s)]
*  Sounds like they did an English uprising. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4731.54s)]
*  That is 20. It's fucking funny. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4734.3s)]
*  I was just driving from Manchester to London. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4736.34s)]
*  When you get into London, the speed limit is 20 miles an hour. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4738.9s)]
*  That is so crazy. It's insane. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4743.54s)]
*  How many kilometers per hour is that? [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4745.42s)]
*  I don't know, because my driver had it was in miles per hour, like his speedometer. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4746.98s)]
*  And it was 20 miles an hour he was going. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4752.9s)]
*  And it just feels like you're in slow motion. It's insane. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4755.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, do they do they always use miles per hour? [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4757.82s)]
*  I think they use kilometers, right? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4760.66s)]
*  No, I think Canada uses kilometers. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4762.099999999999s)]
*  I thought they use kilometers. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4763.74s)]
*  But this car specifically had miles per hour on the speedometer. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4765.54s)]
*  But you're on the wrong side of the road. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4768.9s)]
*  Yeah. Is that weird? [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4770.62s)]
*  I was a bad driver on the right side of the road. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4772.3s)]
*  Well, I wasn't driving. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4774.34s)]
*  I did drive in Jamaica, because that was an English owned country. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4775.139999999999s)]
*  So they're on the opposite side as well. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4780.3s)]
*  And I rented mopeds when I was in Jamaica. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4782.66s)]
*  And you get used to it very quickly. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4785.0599999999995s)]
*  Like you think it's going to really turn you around. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4787.099999999999s)]
*  But like whatever it is, your mind just flips it. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4788.62s)]
*  And as soon as I drive into Canada right away, we're in Canada signs. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4791.3s)]
*  I'm like, oh, no, oh, no. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4794.78s)]
*  Here we go. We got to go to East. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4796.66s)]
*  Yeah. Oust, North. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4798.139999999999s)]
*  How many different countries use inches and miles an hour? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4800.42s)]
*  Doesn't everybody use kilometers now? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4803.5s)]
*  Doesn't everybody use the metric system? [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4805.58s)]
*  I still think they're wrong. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4807.219999999999s)]
*  They tried it on us when I was in high school. Really? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4809.3s)]
*  Yeah, they tried to read. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4811.9400000000005s)]
*  They tried to introduce the metric systems if this is going to be the thing [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4812.780000000001s)]
*  that we all accept. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4815.46s)]
*  And everybody's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4816.58s)]
*  Antiquated. Not in this country. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4818.860000000001s)]
*  I don't follow the Dewey Decimal system either. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4820.54s)]
*  Nope. Suck my dick, old people. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4822.38s)]
*  Oh, fuck your kilograms. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4823.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It's a weird thing that one country just says, nah, we can't learn it. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4827.54s)]
*  Fuck that. I mean, how many countries have it? [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4833.62s)]
*  How many countries have inches? [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4835.860000000001s)]
*  I think it's maybe England. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4837.78s)]
*  It says the UK, USA and Canada keep miles per hour. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4839.139999999999s)]
*  Oh, so is that what is England has miles per hour? [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4843.3s)]
*  Oh, no, they have it like it's it's double, but it's their main thing [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4845.179999999999s)]
*  is definitely kilometers for sure. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4848.82s)]
*  So everything else, it's. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4850.62s)]
*  Everything else is kilometers. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4853.099999999999s)]
*  So it's like six countries that have kilometer or miles per hour. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4854.219999999999s)]
*  Or inches. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4861.54s)]
*  This is weird that we didn't. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4863.94s)]
*  I still don't know. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4865.0199999999995s)]
*  I feel like Dick is inches in every place. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4866.06s)]
*  My dick is 36 decimeters. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4869.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, 26000 kilometers. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4871.900000000001s)]
*  You know, I guess you guys have a vast majority. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4875.900000000001s)]
*  Come countries use kilometers per hour. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4877.9800000000005s)]
*  Nine percent of the world uses miles per hour. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4881.9800000000005s)]
*  US being the notable example. Interesting. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4884.26s)]
*  So it's all the UK. I wasn't wrong. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4886.38s)]
*  When I was in England for the fights, they measure people in stone. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4887.860000000001s)]
*  So they say 10 stone. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4892.02s)]
*  I have no idea what that means. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4894.3s)]
*  I think it's 230 pounds. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4895.5s)]
*  I think it's is it 13 pounds each stone? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4897.74s)]
*  It's a weird old timey fucking measure. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4900.42s)]
*  But you have to say it was actually a soft fighting. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4903.22s)]
*  I think so. Probably. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4906.34s)]
*  I think it was about so that would be 240 pounds, 10 stone. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4908.02s)]
*  I think it was actually like like a fucking scale, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4910.82s)]
*  just a scale with like a person on one side and stones on the other. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4913.86s)]
*  I think it's what it comes from. I do like England, though. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4917.06s)]
*  It's shitty food, but it's still just a cool, like one. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4919.22s)]
*  You like being the only circumcised person in a room piece of shit. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4921.54s)]
*  So no, 10 stones, 140 pounds, right? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4924.94s)]
*  You said you said it's 14 pounds per. Yeah. OK. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4927.78s)]
*  20 stone be 240 pounds. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4931.179999999999s)]
*  So then you'd have to say the like eight, like five stone, nine ounces, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4933.26s)]
*  then say the fucking pounds afterwards. It's weird. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4937.98s)]
*  Like why we're talking about weird things to keep holding on to stone. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4940.62s)]
*  That's a strange one. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4944.94s)]
*  Do you go and see the places and any of those weird destinations for you? [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4946.38s)]
*  I definitely have. Yeah. Yeah. London's cool. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4949.34s)]
*  It's interesting. You go into a bar that's a 500 year old place. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4952.0599999999995s)]
*  It's weird. Like there's some old shit in that town. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4956.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You know, you see how New York was like designed after it. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4959.38s)]
*  So yeah, yeah. London's a cool town. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4962.38s)]
*  I like I like honestly, I like cities that remind me of New York. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4965.219999999999s)]
*  So like I love Rome. Rome's like the OG New York. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4968.7s)]
*  It's fucking really cool. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4971.7s)]
*  So I don't think you're right. Never been. How's like New York? [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4974.0199999999995s)]
*  It's just it feels like because back in the day, it was like the most hope. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4977.66s)]
*  You talk so the hub. It's like very fast moving. Yeah. They were. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=4981.3s)]

*  before she got out in the world. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=5910.5s)]
*  Like he went crazy. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=5911.780000000001s)]
*  But I still feel like you should lock that guy up. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=5912.900000000001s)]

*  That and then the Tough Crowd. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6103.82s)]
*  We did a Tough Crowd reunion [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6104.82s)]

*  I think he just doesn't want to. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6125.259999999999s)]
*  Well, it might be something [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6126.66s)]
*  that someone needs to offer it to him [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6127.86s)]

*  When I, the last time I did a Tough Crowd, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6158.88s)]
*  he warmed up the crowd, [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6161.9s)]
*  and so he's doing stand up in front of the crowd, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6162.74s)]
*  and he was fucking murdering. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6164.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm like, this is way better than even Tough Crowd. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6165.82s)]
*  Like he's one of the most underrated guys of all time. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6168.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6171.5s)]

*  for every comedian. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6179.94s)]
*  It was also though, that place was like [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6180.86s)]

*  When they had him on there. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6188.82s)]
*  The only segment that was produced of Tough Crowd, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6189.66s)]
*  you remember, was the last one. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6193.9s)]
*  You had to write and give them like the, [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6195.22s)]
*  whatever your little rant was gonna be about the final. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6197.38s)]
*  You did it once, right? [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6199.0199999999995s)]
*  I did it once. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6199.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6200.68s)]
*  About that final topic. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6201.5199999999995s)]
*  That was the only like homework you had to do at all. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6202.7s)]
*  And that fan was clearly gonna do something [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6205.38s)]
*  about like his mother and do the voice or something. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6209.22s)]
*  And Patrice, right before he, [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6211.82s)]
*  was about to do his part for his fourth segment thing, [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6214.54s)]
*  he goes, hey, let's see if you can do two minutes [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6216.76s)]
*  of that talk about doing your mom accent. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6218.66s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6220.78s)]
*  And then Voss and all those guys just like [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6222.22s)]
*  started pouncing on him. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6223.66s)]
*  And then he just had to go like, [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6224.5s)]
*  hey, you guys, so my mother called me over. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6225.34s)]
*  Oh. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6229.3s)]
*  Oh, you had to do it still. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6230.139999999999s)]
*  Oh, I started doing it. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6231.74s)]
*  That's only prepared. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6232.58s)]
*  Ooh, man. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6235.22s)]
*  That was, but it was like an OG podcast. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6236.0599999999995s)]
*  Before podcasting was podcasting. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6238.099999999999s)]
*  Like just a bunch of comics sitting around [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6240.0199999999995s)]
*  just barking at each other, arguing. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6242.26s)]
*  So fun. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6244.26s)]
*  It was fun. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6245.099999999999s)]
*  Way ahead of its time. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6245.92s)]
*  But then again, like Regis and Kathie Lee [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6246.82s)]
*  was a podcast technically too. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6249.26s)]
*  Technically, if you really think about it. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6250.1s)]
*  The View, all these shows. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6251.94s)]
*  I think Opie and Anthony was the big start of it all. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6253.14s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6255.22s)]
*  That was what started it off for me. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6256.06s)]
*  Cause that was the first time I was ever on a show [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6257.46s)]
*  where it was no structure. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6259.3s)]
*  It was just comics. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6261.42s)]
*  Oh yeah, just shoot the shit, yeah. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6262.26s)]
*  Like we all could be on Opie and Anthony, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6263.1s)]
*  we'd be having this exact same conversation [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6264.46s)]
*  except Norton and Kumia and Opie would be here. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6266.12s)]
*  Same fucking conversation. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6268.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6269.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, it was just, they would let you go. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6270.82s)]
*  I was more of a Howard Stern guy. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6272.72s)]
*  You know, I know so were you as well. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6274.62s)]
*  But without Opie and Anthony, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6276.18s)]
*  shows like Legion of Skanks wouldn't exist. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6278.08s)]
*  That's the truth. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6279.88s)]
*  Also, there's a lot of fans that are just like, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6280.7s)]
*  just these 50 year old truckers [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6282.92s)]

*  Our generation was having a much harder time. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6286.24s)]
*  It wasn't like back in the day when Stern, [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6289.08s)]
*  Howard Stern was bringing on comics, all the comics, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6290.8s)]
*  cause that was like his crew he was trying to build up. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6293.12s)]
*  We were past that. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6295.76s)]
*  So we had no, there was no show [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6296.64s)]
*  that was like that for anybody except for Opie and Anthony. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6299.6s)]
*  I was Ron and Fez. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6301.88s)]

*  like fucking prehistoric, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=6319.68s)]

*  the first picture we ever took here. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7138.76s)]

*  Ah, that's hilarious. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7159.28s)]
*  The difference between us and Dave. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7162.76s)]

*  First of all, Shane doesn't need the Rogan sphere anymore. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7174.48s)]
*  Let's just move Shane out, move Big J into that position. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7177.24s)]
*  Doesn't require the Rogan sphere at all. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7180.04s)]
*  Ari's moving to fucking Thailand or something. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7180.879999999999s)]

*  You're in the sphere right now, you're on the show. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7207.48s)]
*  Every time the Rogan sphere gets talked about, [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7209.36s)]
*  we never get, when Cat Williams said six unfunny comics. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7211.2s)]

*  I would have had him on a long time ago. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7238.68s)]
*  He's an interesting story. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7239.88s)]

*  But I watched this documentary about watching [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7797.28s)]
*  these fucking cargo ships get nailed [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7798.96s)]

*  Oh my god, it's terrifying dude. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7806.32s)]
*  And the gade wave goes sideways. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7807.36s)]
*  So where is it, that's the Black Sea? [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7809.4s)]

*  Turkey? [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7813.16s)]
*  Yeah, between Turkey and the UK. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7814.0s)]

*  They snapped the cargo ship in two. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7835.6s)]
*  The wave was so big it snapped this fucking ship in half. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7837.6s)]
*  Fuck that. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7841.8s)]

*  I don't know, I don't think this is the one. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7916.6s)]
*  It's in India? [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7918.08s)]

*  It's all UV cars. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7922.56s)]
*  Isn't there theoretically people [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7923.88s)]
*  in some of those cargo things? [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7925.04s)]
*  Cargo ship carrying UVs on fire. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7926.56s)]
*  Or EVs, sorry, EVs, not UVs. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7929.88s)]
*  Is that just the wire, [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7932.280000000001s)]
*  or is that how they get people over sometimes? [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7933.120000000001s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, that's it. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7937.64s)]
*  So that's filled with electric cars. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7939.56s)]

*  Yeah, I'm not sold in the electric car. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7953.04s)]
*  They're great when they work. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7954.72s)]
*  It's just like, if you have them plugged into your house, [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7956.4800000000005s)]
*  it's the shit. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7959.0s)]
*  You never go to the gas station, [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7959.84s)]
*  you just plug it in when you go to sleep at night, [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7961.6s)]
*  it's easy. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7963.68s)]
*  I think you need your car to be more reliable [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7964.52s)]
*  than your phone. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7966.200000000001s)]
*  Well, they're really reliable. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7967.4800000000005s)]
*  The thing is about driving them, like Teslas, [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7969.04s)]
*  they never fuck up. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7970.84s)]
*  I've had three of them. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7971.68s)]

*  Really? Yeah, nothing. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7974.200000000001s)]
*  I had one problem with a windshield wiper motor, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7975.4800000000005s)]
*  it was simple. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7977.320000000001s)]
*  Do you get rid of them because it's just time? [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7978.160000000001s)]
*  It's a lease, I get a lease. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7979.72s)]
*  So you get a new one, yeah, okay. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7980.56s)]
*  You're not like, shit, this thing's starting to peter out. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7982.84s)]
*  No, no, well they make them better every three years. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7984.32s)]
*  When do they peter out? [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7986.96s)]
*  What's the death of a Tesla? [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7987.88s)]
*  It's a good question. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7988.72s)]
*  You can get them that are many years old, [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7989.56s)]
*  it's just their batteries degrade slightly over time. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7992.0s)]
*  So if it first comes from the factory with 340 miles, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=7995.52s)]
*  after five, six, seven, eight years, [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8000.0s)]
*  it's probably got 280 miles or something like that. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8002.0s)]
*  So that's all, just efficiency kind of goes down? [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8005.52s)]
*  Yeah, but for driving around town, [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8007.52s)]
*  if you're just taking it to commute, it's easy. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8009.84s)]
*  You just plug it in when you go to bed at night. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8012.320000000001s)]
*  You don't ever have to go to the gas station again. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8013.160000000001s)]
*  Silent, they move faster than anything you've ever driven. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8014.92s)]
*  I mean, how quickly do you get a return on investment? [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8017.4400000000005s)]
*  Because the amount of money you save in gas has to be like. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8019.76s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8022.12s)]
*  I'm wondering about the miles, that's what I'm saying. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8023.08s)]
*  I remember when I was a kid, and you remember this too, [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8024.64s)]
*  they would say, oh, Hondas are the best [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8028.04s)]
*  because you can get 200-some thousand miles, [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8030.04s)]
*  300,000 miles. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8031.84s)]

*  Yeah, you buy a Tacoma, [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8037.0s)]

*  For sure, they'll make a car with a carburetor, [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8186.92s)]
*  the whole deal. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8189.5199999999995s)]
*  Most of them don't though. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8190.36s)]
*  Most of them use a crate engine. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8191.719999999999s)]
*  So what they'll do is like they'll take an old car, [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8193.24s)]
*  like a 68 Mustang and they put a Coyote 5.0 in it, [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8195.32s)]
*  like a modern Ford eight cylinder Coyote engine in it. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8199.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the new ones. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8202.92s)]

*  this little motherboard, like you program it, [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8206.119999999999s)]
*  you know, it has electronic fuel injection. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8208.8s)]
*  I used to have a Grand Cherokee [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8210.76s)]
*  that when I got out of the car, sometimes to start it, [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8212.0s)]
*  I learned I had to get a hammer [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8215.44s)]
*  and hit a certain part of the engine [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8217.92s)]
*  and then it would start. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8219.36s)]
*  I think it was the starter possibly, [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8221.36s)]
*  you had the crank it and it did start. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8222.96s)]
*  Why did you just get a new starter? [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8226.4s)]
*  Why you hit it with a hammer? [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8227.56s)]
*  It broke. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8228.6s)]
*  I was way back, way back in the day too. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8229.44s)]
*  So I got the car from, it was one of those like, [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8231.6s)]
*  what do you call it, the auctions. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8237.28s)]
*  You know, they've repoed cars and shit like that. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8238.72s)]
*  So it was a piece of shit. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8240.6s)]
*  Clanking, getting it to start. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8242.759999999998s)]
*  When you open up, you could have a car for a year [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8244.32s)]
*  at this point, a brand new car and open it up [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8247.039999999999s)]
*  and it looks brand new because it's not, [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8248.199999999999s)]
*  it's barely engine parts. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8250.039999999999s)]
*  It's mostly computers, like a big plastic covering [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8252.119999999999s)]
*  over a computer essentially. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8254.439999999999s)]
*  Right, you can't like get in there and work on it. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8255.519999999999s)]
*  When you say, when you bring it in and go, [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8257.599999999999s)]
*  hey, it's having a problem, they go, did the light go? [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8259.519999999999s)]
*  This happened to me last, the light went away. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8263.0s)]
*  So the light's not on anymore, but it was there. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8265.0s)]
*  They could plug it in and find out that there was a light [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8267.08s)]
*  that came on at some point, [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8269.08s)]
*  but they can't do anything to it if it's not happening. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8270.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8272.64s)]
*  There's not a thing where it's like, [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8273.48s)]
*  there's this clicking, it's probably a belt. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8274.300000000001s)]
*  Those days are over I think. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8275.800000000001s)]
*  Oh really? [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8277.2s)]
*  I think so. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8278.02s)]
*  They seem confused by. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8279.880000000001s)]
*  You're going to bad mechanics maybe. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8281.76s)]
*  It's the dealership. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8283.880000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8284.92s)]
*  So they probably have everything connected [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8286.36s)]
*  to a computer program and the computer program [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8287.800000000001s)]
*  talks to the computers in the car. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8290.2s)]
*  I think that's what you have to do with everything now. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8293.04s)]
*  It's no more like, we knew our, my mom, [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8295.04s)]

*  My mom really. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8307.640000000001s)]
*  Probably both of them, your mom? [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8308.48s)]
*  My mom really threw the puss around [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8309.32s)]

*  You feel like the shifting is, [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8552.320000000002s)]
*  the steering's electric. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8553.68s)]

*  Well, that's why people like to drive old cars still. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8561.52s)]
*  Like to feel them. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8563.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, if I had the money, I would get something. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8565.52s)]
*  That's why I said I asked about [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8567.720000000001s)]
*  if you can do a new engine in a car. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8568.560000000001s)]
*  You have money. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8570.4s)]
*  So many cars I missed. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8571.24s)]
*  You could get a car with a nice engine. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8572.08s)]
*  No. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8574.2s)]
*  You literally have two brand new cars. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8575.04s)]

*  You don't want a lease. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8578.44s)]
*  You're not going to fix it yourself. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8579.28s)]
*  And one's a Ram, which apparently sucks. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8580.36s)]

*  Never. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8583.0s)]
*  So then find a mechanic that you trust. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8583.84s)]
*  Ask around, get a relationship with this mechanic [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8588.76s)]
*  and get a fucking cool car. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8592.12s)]

*  A dream car? [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8600.92s)]
*  Maybe a dream. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8601.76s)]
*  The dream changes. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8602.6s)]
*  When I was a kid. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8603.44s)]
*  Jaguar, the one with the actual, [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8604.28s)]
*  the hood ornament that was a Jaguar. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8605.6s)]
*  I looked it up a couple years ago. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8608.76s)]
*  I wanted to get like an old school Jaguar SJ6 or something [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8611.16s)]
*  or whatever it was. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8615.52s)]
*  Early 90s? [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8616.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, early 90s. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8617.36s)]
*  They were the coolest cars ever. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8618.36s)]
*  And I looked it up recently [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8619.2s)]
*  and I found one for like nine grand. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8620.080000000002s)]
*  Like, just it looked great. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8621.68s)]
*  And then I was gonna buy it. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8623.36s)]
*  And then a friend of mine was like, [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8624.720000000001s)]
*  dude, you literally, to get anything fixed on that car [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8625.560000000001s)]
*  is crazy. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8628.6s)]
*  Like, you'll never find the parts. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8629.44s)]
*  Like, it's just, you're just, especially. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8630.68s)]
*  That is a tough one. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8631.52s)]
*  I was young, the one that like the cool kids had [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8632.52s)]
*  that you're like, damn, I wish I had that, [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8635.080000000002s)]
*  was that boxy looking Mustang 5.0. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8636.28s)]
*  Oh. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8640.880000000001s)]
*  That was the one added with the convertible. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8641.720000000001s)]
*  The convertible, yep. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8643.36s)]
*  That's the exact one. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8644.28s)]
*  Roll it in my 5.0. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8645.12s)]
*  Rims on it and the convertible. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8646.92s)]
*  And that one just, that was the one. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8649.08s)]
*  That was a good car. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8651.44s)]
*  But talk about it changing. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8652.28s)]
*  When I was a little kid, [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8653.56s)]
*  this was one of the most hurtful, [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8654.4s)]
*  fat comments ever in my life. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8655.76s)]
*  When I was like, dude, when I get older, [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8658.28s)]
*  I wanna get a Mazda Miata. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8660.2s)]
*  And they go, that's gonna be a fucking roller skate [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8661.56s)]
*  on your fat body. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8663.16s)]
*  And I was like, okay. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8664.48s)]
*  Well, I guess I'll get past the Miata. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8665.8s)]
*  And now sometimes you see one on the road still [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8667.44s)]
*  and I still go, damn, it's pretty cool looking. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8668.88s)]
*  You ever seen those Miata's that they do conversions with? [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8671.68s)]
*  They put a V8 in them? [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8673.92s)]
*  Mm-mm. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8675.0s)]
*  Yeah, there was a company called Flying Miata [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8675.84s)]
*  and they sold it to another company [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8677.68s)]
*  that's in Florida that does it now. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8679.16s)]
*  I don't know what the name of it is. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8680.56s)]
*  But they take a regular Miata [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8681.960000000001s)]
*  and they stuff a big fucking aluminum GM crate engine in it. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8684.76s)]
*  And it's got like 500 horsepower. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8690.16s)]
*  It's madness. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8692.48s)]
*  And this tiny little car, it weighs nothing. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8693.52s)]
*  Just lifts off the ground. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8695.880000000001s)]
*  But apparently they are a riot to drive. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8696.92s)]
*  They're like the most fun cars to drive [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8699.48s)]
*  because they're super light with crazy power. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8701.36s)]
*  And these new engines are not that heavy [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8703.68s)]
*  so it doesn't fuck with the balance that much. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8705.68s)]
*  It's like slightly heavier than the stock engine [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8707.720000000001s)]
*  but insane amounts of power and it sounds insane. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8710.0s)]
*  When we were down at a Nashville comedy festival, [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8713.52s)]
*  there was a guy who used to work at the club [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8716.24s)]
*  who pulled up in a like gold and blue. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8719.36s)]
*  Lamborghini. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8724.48s)]
*  Lamborghini. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8725.32s)]
*  And it was just like the colors were crazy [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8726.56s)]
*  and it had some writing on it. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8728.64s)]
*  And we were so curious about it. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8730.28s)]
*  He won it in a sweepstakes. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8731.52s)]
*  He actually won a Lamborghini in sweepstakes. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8733.12s)]
*  These are those cars. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8736.48s)]
*  Like give me some volumes so we can hear this thing. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8737.68s)]
*  The Miata? [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8739.6s)]
*  Yeah, these are the flying Miata's. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8740.44s)]
*  Okay, that's not a Miata. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8744.76s)]
*  I mean, it's just the front. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8746.24s)]
*  This is the Miata. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8749.64s)]
*  That sounds crazy. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8753.76s)]
*  But there's a new company that does it now. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8755.32s)]
*  It's not them. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8757.2s)]
*  And there's some better videos [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8758.039999999999s)]
*  where they show like what the. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8760.16s)]
*  Who's driving that thing, Cat Williams? [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8761.0s)]
*  I think it was hugging the corners. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8763.6s)]
*  Imagine if Cat Williams enters F1. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8765.44s)]
*  So she's winning races. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8767.44s)]
*  Oh, you never thought I could do it. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8769.08s)]
*  F1's really like right in the streets of a town. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8771.36s)]
*  Yeah, in Monaco. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8773.84s)]
*  They drive through the streets. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8775.52s)]
*  They do it in Vegas too. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8776.52s)]
*  They did it in Canada. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8777.92s)]
*  Oh, did they? [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8780.36s)]
*  In Montreal, I think one year the festival was there [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8781.2s)]
*  that was like they were preparing for F1. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8782.48s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8784.0s)]
*  It's wild. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8784.960000000001s)]
*  They do it out here, [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8785.800000000001s)]
*  but they do it at the Circuit of the Americas. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8786.62s)]
*  That's what that neon sign up there is. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8787.800000000001s)]
*  Oh really? [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=8790.32s)]

*  and David Carradine, that was news. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9306.7s)]
*  That made news they die from that. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9308.84s)]
*  How good could it possibly feel? [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9310.36s)]
*  To get choked during sex? [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9313.480000000001s)]

*  It's probably pretty good, dude. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9318.36s)]
*  People say it mimics, a lot of times former addicts do it [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9319.6s)]
*  because it mimics the feeling of the high of heroin. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9322.800000000001s)]
*  That's what they said. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9326.12s)]

*  Who knows? [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9330.26s)]

*  Died, jerking off. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9342.94s)]
*  So now, they'd rather have you think they were just depressed [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9343.92s)]
*  and going through it than saying that [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9346.78s)]
*  because that's all you're gonna be known for now. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9348.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9349.92s)]

*  while he killed himself. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9360.2s)]
*  Well, you'd rather feel that it was on purpose [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9361.04s)]
*  because he was desperate and sad [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9363.28s)]

*  And then choke yourself. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9566.92s)]
*  He missed. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9567.76s)]
*  Yeah, he missed. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9568.6s)]
*  And died later. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9569.44s)]
*  He died in the hospital. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9570.82s)]
*  That'd be my biggest fear is like shooting, [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9571.66s)]
*  like just angling it wrong and then just. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9573.300000000001s)]
*  I saw a video of a guy who did that with a shotgun. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9576.26s)]
*  He just took off the front of his face and was blind. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9579.18s)]
*  Lived. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9582.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9583.22s)]
*  Life is now worse. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9584.06s)]
*  Richard Jennings takes his life. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9585.22s)]
*  Dave Couye never even tried to take his life. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9586.460000000001s)]
*  Richard Jennings was funny. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9589.14s)]
*  Very funny. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9590.86s)]
*  Back in the day, he was the fucking man. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9591.7s)]
*  He was depressed that he never wound up being a movie star. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9593.66s)]
*  He wanted to be like, [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9595.9s)]
*  he wanted to be the next Jim Carrey, you know. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9596.74s)]
*  He got close with the mask [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9599.82s)]
*  and they said just made him more bummed. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9600.94s)]
*  It's crazy because he's like, [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9604.220000000001s)]
*  to us, all the comics back then, [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9605.5s)]
*  he was the guy, you know. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9607.380000000001s)]
*  Well, he was on all those shows. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9609.460000000001s)]
*  Were you doing comedy at a time? [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9610.54s)]
*  Do you have performances on like A-List [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9612.220000000001s)]
*  and Stand Up Spotlight or VH1? [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9614.94s)]
*  I did a bunch of those. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9618.02s)]
*  You did those things? [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9618.86s)]
*  Yeah, I did a bunch of those. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9619.68s)]
*  Caroline's Comedy Hour was a biggie? [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9620.52s)]
*  Yeah, I did that. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9621.34s)]
*  I did MTV Half Hour Comedy Hour. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9622.18s)]
*  That was Pauly, right? [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9624.66s)]
*  No, that was Pauly. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9625.98s)]
*  It was totally Pauly. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9626.82s)]
*  MTV Half Hour Comedy Hour was another show [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9628.18s)]
*  that would do like 10 minutes or something. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9630.699999999999s)]
*  I forget what the time was. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9633.3s)]
*  VH1 did one of those with Rosie O'Donnell [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9634.619999999999s)]
*  kind of hosted them or something. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9636.779999999999s)]
*  Yep, yep, yep. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9637.619999999999s)]
*  Those were Fridays. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9639.119999999999s)]
*  It seemed like it was a pretty fun time in comedy. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9639.96s)]
*  Comedy was pretty polluted with like [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9642.859999999999s)]
*  a lot of same-ole, same-ole at the time, [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9644.619999999999s)]
*  but I mean like what a time to kind of like, [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9647.5s)]
*  that's why it was funny when I was opening [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9649.859999999999s)]
*  for David Tell all those years, [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9651.26s)]
*  he couldn't get a grasp on like the change [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9652.34s)]
*  that I was experiencing. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9656.06s)]
*  He was kind of like, after three years, [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9658.18s)]
*  you want to go with me to this club again? [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9660.18s)]
*  And I'd go, absolutely. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9661.5s)]
*  And he'd go, aren't you headlining this place yet? [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9663.22s)]
*  And it's like, it doesn't work like that anymore. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9665.1s)]
*  Because he's from a time where they say, [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9667.18s)]
*  if you got an hour of comedy together, [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9668.34s)]
*  then you tore, that's what they say. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9669.539999999999s)]
*  Well, Dave was way ahead of his time. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9670.9s)]
*  You tore that hour of comedy. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9672.46s)]
*  He goes, you can't just do that. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9673.539999999999s)]
*  Like, you need a place to book you. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9675.46s)]
*  Well, Dave, before, I mean back when I started, [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9676.619999999999s)]
*  this is 21 years ago, people would just have their act. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9678.74s)]
*  Do you remember Seinfeld's documentary [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9681.78s)]
*  where he was like, he's like, [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9683.22s)]
*  I'm gonna get rid of my act after 20 years [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9684.18s)]
*  and have a new hour. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9685.94s)]
*  It's like, that's what everyone does now. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9686.78s)]
*  The standard of comedy has changed so much. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9688.220000000001s)]
*  But I feel like Attell was always like that. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9690.300000000001s)]
*  He would turn over, he was very prolific. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9691.900000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, for sure. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9694.26s)]
*  I'm saying he didn't get that change [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9695.08s)]
*  that now you have to be able to sell tickets [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9697.140000000001s)]
*  to get book places. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9700.140000000001s)]
*  It wasn't just like, well, you're one of the comics [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9701.1s)]
*  who has an hour in the country. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9702.94s)]
*  There was a time when it was that. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9705.1s)]
*  It was like, these guys, I think it was like the two coasts, [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9706.060000000001s)]
*  really, it was all of it. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9708.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9710.060000000001s)]
*  Then the internet, I think, really opened it up [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9710.900000000001s)]
*  to the rest of the country and it's like saturation now. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9712.18s)]
*  Yeah, you used to be able to go to clubs [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9714.220000000001s)]
*  and build a market. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9717.039999999999s)]
*  So you just keep returning. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9717.88s)]
*  You turn like once a year and after a few years, [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9719.6s)]
*  people come to see you like, oh, Big J's coming. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9721.92s)]
*  He's really funny. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9724.06s)]
*  We saw him last time. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9724.9s)]
*  San Fran Punchline, Stress Factory, [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9725.72s)]
*  or maybe two of the only clubs that really, [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9727.6s)]
*  I know there's more. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9729.64s)]
*  Oh, the Providence Comedy Connection. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9730.48s)]
*  Let me go there and have enjoyed watching it be like, [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9732.72s)]
*  giving me a couple hundred dollars for a weekend [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9735.92s)]
*  to change over the years. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9737.8s)]
*  I remember, I opened for you, [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9738.64s)]
*  you made $600 for the weekend as the headliner. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9740.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9742.76s)]
*  Yeah, they give you a chance. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9743.6s)]
*  And if you're good and they know you're good [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9744.6s)]
*  and they give you a chance, the people trust them [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9746.439999999999s)]
*  because they've got a long history of booking good comedy. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9747.96s)]
*  It's like, who's this guy? [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9750.08s)]
*  Is he good? [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9750.92s)]
*  Oh, let's take a chance. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9751.76s)]
*  Right, but places got afraid. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9752.58s)]
*  I remember that hurt so much. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9754.08s)]
*  I opened for Steve-O when he first started doing comedy, [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9755.4s)]
*  stand-up, I performed, and I'd done DC and Providence Tell [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9759.6s)]
*  and stuff before and I did that weekend. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9762.24s)]
*  And I hate when you go hat in hand to places [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9764.0s)]
*  and you get bad news. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9766.68s)]
*  I remember going to the booker there [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9767.519999999999s)]
*  who was someone who's so friendly to me now [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9769.42s)]
*  and she's great, but it was so hard. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9771.08s)]
*  I go, hey, I'd love to come back and headline, [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9773.64s)]
*  even in an off weekend, [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9776.4s)]
*  when people don't wanna do Fourth of July, [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9777.519999999999s)]
*  Thanksgiving, whatever, and she goes, [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9779.24s)]
*  yeah, I'd love to, but you don't sell any tickets. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9780.519999999999s)]
*  So it's all about selling tickets. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9783.64s)]
*  And she laid it out like that. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9785.119999999999s)]
*  And I was like, well, how do you, [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9786.32s)]
*  I didn't even know how to start making that happen, [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9788.359999999999s)]
*  especially when we started Legion of Skanks and stuff. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9790.56s)]
*  Well, podcasting sort of created an opportunity [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9792.64s)]
*  for comics to- The best. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9795.24s)]
*  Yeah. The best opportunity. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9797.119999999999s)]
*  Build an audience, people, they know us, [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9797.96s)]
*  they feel like they're really sitting here with us. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9799.699999999999s)]
*  Well, they really are, right? [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9802.56s)]
*  And we talk like this if we were in the green room. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9804.119999999999s)]
*  The difference between podcasts and everything else [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9806.92s)]
*  is we're really talking just the way we talk. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9808.6s)]
*  Yeah. You know? [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9810.64s)]
*  But everyone also gets mad to it, [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9812.279999999999s)]
*  like what the thing is besides stand-up [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9813.519999999999s)]
*  that makes it happen, whether it's podcasts, [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9815.76s)]
*  internet videos. Yes. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9817.76s)]
*  I've learned also to stop having that [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9819.279999999999s)]
*  because people get a lot too much wrapped into that. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9820.72s)]
*  Like there's a social media comic [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9822.199999999999s)]
*  or there's a whatever, it goes. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9824.359999999999s)]
*  Buddy, I don't know, my ex-wife does comedy [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9825.859999999999s)]
*  and people ask me like, are you mad that she does comedy? [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9827.519999999999s)]
*  Like I can't judge why anybody gets involved in it. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9829.6s)]
*  I got involved because somebody suggested it to me. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9832.800000000001s)]
*  It's crazy to even want to. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9833.960000000001s)]
*  To care. Like who gives a fuck? [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9835.480000000001s)]
*  Like why did you do it? [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9836.960000000001s)]
*  Because I was having funny tweets [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9837.800000000001s)]
*  so I figured I'd give it a shot. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9838.78s)]
*  Like okay, it seems like a good enough reason [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9839.76s)]
*  as anybody else starts. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9841.92s)]
*  The first decade, you don't even, there's no path, [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9843.12s)]
*  but like what is the path to like even making money? [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9845.640000000001s)]
*  You're just doing it blindly going like, [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9848.480000000001s)]
*  I hope something happens eventually. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9849.960000000001s)]
*  People get mad because I think there is a path now [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9852.08s)]
*  to making money very quick and people are doing it [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9854.08s)]
*  and so it's that, it's the Howard Stern, [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9856.400000000001s)]
*  used to shit on, it was that famous thing with him and Ari. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9858.640000000001s)]
*  Shitting on the idea of podcasts. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9861.52s)]
*  But when people were shitty about that, [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9863.32s)]
*  I always understood his anger, [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9864.640000000001s)]
*  at least I don't agree with it, [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9866.24s)]
*  but I understand when he did the AM rate. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9868.32s)]
*  Well his anger didn't make sense [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9870.12s)]
*  because he was already super famous. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9871.32s)]
*  No, but his argument was saying, [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9872.84s)]
*  I had to do AM shift, 2 AM to 6 AM in this shitty town. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9874.28s)]
*  I had to do this and I played music [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9879.28s)]
*  until they realized it would be better [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9881.28s)]
*  to let me talk 10 years later. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9882.48s)]
*  And he went through all that, [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9884.800000000001s)]
*  then it's just like, well you could flip on a switch [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9885.640000000001s)]
*  and if you have an audience already [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9887.6s)]
*  or connected to somebody who has an audience, [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9888.68s)]
*  you're doing it already, you're just doing it now. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9891.16s)]
*  Well also the difference is we all hang out with each other [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9893.480000000001s)]
*  and do each other's podcasts, [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9896.400000000001s)]
*  whereas those radio guys all fucking hated each other. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9897.76s)]
*  Like Howard Stern, Haley Obey and Anthony. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9900.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they would talk shit about each other all the time. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9902.6s)]
*  Obey and Anthony used to have, what was it, Jocktober? [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9904.68s)]
*  Where they would just find shitty radio shows [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9908.16s)]
*  and they would have their fans torture them [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9910.16s)]
*  for an entire month. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9912.24s)]
*  Oh, so funny. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9913.68s)]
*  Fucking brutal. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9915.08s)]
*  Cuttle wrote. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9916.12s)]
*  Yeah, cut, it was a different. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9916.960000000001s)]
*  Podcast doesn't have to be. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9917.800000000001s)]
*  Right, because you could only be [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9918.92s)]
*  the one big radio guy in Philly. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9920.72s)]
*  And if Stern was coming into Philly [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9923.32s)]
*  and if they were gonna open up a syndication thing, [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9924.92s)]
*  he was gonna talk crazy shit on the big guy in Philly, [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9926.84s)]
*  whoever it was, or whatever city it was. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9929.960000000001s)]
*  I do feel it's interesting watching it, [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9931.960000000001s)]
*  I wonder if this happens with every generation. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9933.04s)]
*  The comedy dollar gets stretched though, [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9934.52s)]
*  because it is kind of funny. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9936.32s)]
*  Not that it necessarily hurt. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9937.14s)]
*  I think now with having these kind of like, [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9939.0s)]
*  I'm opening for Shane in some of these arenas and stuff, [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9941.88s)]
*  it's amazing. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9943.52s)]
*  He's getting like 18, 20 some thousand people [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9944.36s)]
*  into these places and doing it. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9946.36s)]
*  One, that's very difficult to think of new jokes [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9949.48s)]
*  when you're doing comedy like that all the time. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9951.9s)]
*  Well, you do clubs. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9953.92s)]
*  For sure, no, I do clubs. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9954.96s)]
*  You have to. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9955.8s)]
*  No, but I mean you have to. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9956.64s)]
*  Like Shane will do clubs also. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9957.88s)]
*  Oh no, for sure. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9959.119999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9959.96s)]
*  I'm just saying, a ticket to see someone in an arena, [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9960.779999999999s)]
*  before they'd be able to see everyone they loved [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9964.0s)]
*  was coming through the improv or whatever, [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9965.599999999999s)]
*  and then a couple were doing theaters. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9967.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9968.96s)]
*  Like now it's like, [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9969.8s)]
*  it's a fucking night out at a sporting event [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9970.64s)]
*  to go see comedy, where it's like, [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9972.359999999999s)]
*  they might not have the money next week [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9974.08s)]
*  to go see me or Lewis at a club. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9975.48s)]
*  I think it has changed. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9978.0s)]
*  It's interesting in that way. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9978.84s)]
*  Well, there's some people that just don't want to spend [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9980.04s)]
*  that kind of money to go to an arena anyway, [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9981.86s)]
*  and they'd rather go see someone in a club. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9983.52s)]
*  Sure. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9985.2s)]
*  It's a better experience. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9986.04s)]
*  It's how comedy's supposed to be. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9986.86s)]
*  The best experience though in an arena is in the round. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9987.76s)]
*  In the round, it's like a giant club. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9990.3s)]
*  That's how Shane does it. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9991.6s)]
*  It's like a giant club. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9992.44s)]
*  It's like a giant club. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9993.26s)]
*  Because the people on this side [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9994.1s)]
*  are watching the people on that side laugh, [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9995.26s)]
*  and you're all laughing at each other. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9996.96s)]
*  It's very intimate, weirdly, [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=9998.52s)]
*  even though there's like 16,000 people. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10000.2s)]
*  The only comedy I don't love at all [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10002.4s)]
*  of the three things, clubs, theaters, is theaters. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10005.14s)]
*  Theaters is impersonal from the crowd enough, [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10008.68s)]
*  and also personal enough that you could still do bad. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10010.84s)]
*  They could turn on you with theater, [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10013.52s)]
*  possibly if you're not the person they're there to see. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10015.84s)]
*  Or even if, you know what I mean? [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10018.22s)]
*  There was like a Nick Swanson thing [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10019.22s)]
*  that where they turned on him. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10020.28s)]
*  Well, he was lit on Edibles. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10021.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10023.52s)]
*  You couldn't remember what the fuck [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10024.36s)]
*  he was talking about. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10025.2s)]
*  My point is to speak, they weren't with him [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10026.02s)]
*  no matter what. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10027.08s)]
*  They did turn on him. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10027.92s)]
*  Something about the arena, and again, [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10029.04s)]
*  Shane's doing an hour at these things, [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10030.8s)]
*  which is impressive as hell. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10032.2s)]
*  For the 20 minutes I have to do, [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10033.12s)]
*  it's like, how could this go bad? [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10035.08s)]
*  If anyone's laughing in there, [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10037.92s)]
*  it sounds like a million people laughing. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10040.16s)]
*  Shane had a guy open for him. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10041.52s)]
*  I don't want to trash the guy. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10043.36s)]
*  I heard it was a sound issue, though. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10044.32s)]
*  But he just like, dude, he just started getting booed. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10046.12s)]
*  Getting booed out of an arena is crazy. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10050.480000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10053.04s)]
*  I mean, you have to feel like, [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10053.880000000001s)]

*  And he kept rattling off, seven more minutes. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10133.32s)]
*  I know that's funny, he had to quit that tour [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10136.72s)]
*  because everywhere he went then, [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10138.2s)]
*  they would start booing him, [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10139.44s)]

*  this is before viral videos were happening like that, [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10144.64s)]
*  and it was such shitty, grainy footage, [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10146.960000000001s)]
*  but that's when I, [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10149.68s)]

*  I said a few of them, [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10160.84s)]
*  when silence doesn't scare you anymore, [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10161.68s)]
*  or just the, I could talk into a microphone, [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10164.24s)]
*  especially for 15 minutes, under any circumstance. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10167.4s)]
*  You know what I mean, like it'll suck, [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10170.6s)]
*  if it's terrible, you got, they're already booing, [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10172.16s)]
*  go out in the very beginning, there's no one there, [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10174.04s)]
*  but like, I'm not afraid of the moment. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10175.6s)]
*  It's a big thing to get over, [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10177.84s)]

*  That's why I said, overseas the first time, [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10182.6s)]
*  I was like, do they even understand English here in England? [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10184.2s)]

*  where I wasn't doing standup at all. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10216.92s)]
*  I was like, let me just refresh my brain, [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10218.2s)]
*  and then I hopped on, started doing other people's shows. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10220.28s)]

*  It's kinda crazy. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10454.84s)]
*  The advice that I would've given a young comic [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10455.76s)]

*  but it's like, do not be on camera [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10460.52s)]
*  for the first decade that you do comedy. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10462.6s)]

*  It's like, could you really? [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10468.36s)]
*  But can it be detrimental if you really eat shit on it [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10469.2s)]
*  and you're like a three year comic? [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10471.68s)]
*  I don't think people remember people bombing on Kill Tony [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10472.6s)]

*  It could be. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10476.2s)]
*  But it could not be if you bounce back [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10477.44s)]
*  and have a great set the next time and the people love you. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10480.08s)]

*  Like 25 times I've been a panelist. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10562.04s)]
*  And when we started doing it, [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10563.36s)]
*  like back in the day in the comedy store, [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10565.400000000001s)]
*  in the belly room, [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10566.960000000001s)]
*  the most fun we would have is when somebody [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10569.480000000001s)]
*  just had a hot one, [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10571.320000000002s)]
*  and then we would just fucking trash them. [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10572.52s)]
*  It became way more supportive now. [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10574.960000000001s)]
*  Like the whole show format is like really like [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10576.560000000001s)]
*  Tony trying to put guys over, [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10578.400000000001s)]
*  but back in the day we were just mean. [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10580.0s)]
*  It was just like a mean, evil fucking thing. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10581.68s)]
*  It was so fun. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10584.44s)]
*  It evolved. [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10585.880000000001s)]
*  Those belly room days were wild, [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10586.720000000001s)]
*  because half the crowd would be like comics. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10588.400000000001s)]
*  There was no one there. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10591.880000000001s)]
*  It was fun, but he kept doing it. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10592.720000000001s)]
*  I mean he fucking did it over and over and over again [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10594.240000000002s)]
*  until he honed that motherfucker down [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10596.28s)]
*  like a samurai sword. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10597.720000000001s)]
*  Now I'm super impressed with it. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10599.080000000002s)]
*  Tony's the man, but that show itself is like. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10600.480000000001s)]
*  I think it's inspiration for like Story Wars. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10604.2s)]
*  Very different show. [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10606.240000000002s)]
*  It's just the idea of like the live. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10607.080000000002s)]
*  The format and like, yeah, yeah. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10608.52s)]
*  That's. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10610.84s)]
*  Skanks has always been a live show, [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10612.52s)]
*  but the development of Story Wars has been very like. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10613.68s)]
*  Well it's also easier when you have a format. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10616.400000000001s)]
*  We literally just set the table and then play, [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10618.36s)]
*  and it's like we don't have to really do much. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10620.84s)]
*  So when you're on a podcast like this or like Skanks, [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10622.28s)]
*  you have to actually kind of like [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10624.76s)]
*  be a little bit more present and like just sort of like [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10626.52s)]
*  you're trying to connect with the comics in a different way. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10629.16s)]
*  When we are, we do, it's like a game show that we created, [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10631.08s)]
*  and it's just super formatted. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10634.28s)]
*  So it's just kind of easy to just. [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10635.92s)]
*  Plug and play funny. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10637.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10638.92s)]
*  Well you guys, by doing Legion of Skanks, [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10639.880000000001s)]
*  just by the name itself, [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10642.480000000001s)]
*  it like opened up the door to wild comedy. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10644.2s)]
*  Cause it's like, you know what you're getting into. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10646.6s)]
*  The show's called Legion of Skanks. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10648.92s)]
*  Well this was a brilliant idea that Jay had. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10650.88s)]
*  Like our secondary tagline is [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10652.08s)]
*  the most offensive podcast on earth. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10654.039999999999s)]
*  And it's not, there's more offensive podcasts. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10655.48s)]
*  But it lets people, I think this is the reason [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10657.039999999999s)]
*  we've never gotten in trouble. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10659.8s)]
*  Is because you know exactly what you're gonna get. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10661.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10663.24s)]
*  It's great, like for anybody to come in. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10664.08s)]
*  Why would you watch this if you don't watch [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10665.08s)]
*  the most offensive podcast? [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10667.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, how are you gonna complain about it? [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10668.2s)]
*  You look like an idiot if you start complaining about it. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10669.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10671.44s)]
*  Adam Kroll had a great analogy about it [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10672.52s)]
*  when he did our show. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10674.039999999999s)]
*  He said, he was like, this is what you guys, [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10674.88s)]
*  why you guys get away with it. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10677.0s)]
*  He's like, when Snoop Dogg goes to the Grammys, [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10677.84s)]
*  Snoop Dogg goes backstage and he lights a blunt. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10680.56s)]
*  And nobody's like, you can't smoke back here. [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10684.04s)]
*  It's like, you invited Snoop Dogg. [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10685.44s)]
*  You know what the fuck you're gonna get. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10686.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10688.08s)]
*  And it's the same thing with us. [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10688.92s)]
*  I think people know what they're gonna get with us. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10689.92s)]
*  We sort of just play and have fun and do our thing. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10692.2s)]
*  Well you give an avenue for comedians that's like, [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10695.64s)]
*  you know, where people know what they're gonna get. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10698.44s)]
*  And obviously people flock to it. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10700.44s)]
*  I mean, Skank Fest sells out immediately. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10702.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10704.48s)]
*  It's because people love the vibe. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10705.32s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10706.48s)]
*  It's just fun. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10707.36s)]
*  We're not here to take ourselves seriously. [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10708.88s)]
*  Also broadcasting has done something for comedy. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10710.6s)]
*  It's pretty amazing that I think broadcasters [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10712.44s)]
*  like the Howard Sterns, they had that all the time. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10716.08s)]
*  It's very interesting when you meet the people, [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10717.52s)]
*  they know you inside and out. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10718.74s)]
*  They know the time you told a story about the thing [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10720.82s)]
*  you fear the most and they know whatever. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10722.44s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10724.24s)]
*  I get used to stuff like that where they'd be like, [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10725.06s)]
*  hey, is your daughter picking a college? [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10726.56s)]
*  And you go, what the fuck you? [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10728.16s)]
*  I'm like, oh I guess I talked about that [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10729.16s)]
*  on the radio this week. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10731.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10732.64s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10733.48s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10734.32s)]
*  You can forget that there's an audience out there sometimes. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10735.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10738.0s)]
*  You forget sometimes the things you say [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10738.84s)]
*  have weight to them. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10740.64s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10742.72s)]
*  We found out the hard way. [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10743.56s)]
*  Who knew what this was gonna happen [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10745.4s)]
*  when we started Legion of Skanks. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10746.4s)]
*  We started Legion of Skanks pretty early podcast times. [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10747.16s)]
*  Not thinking about it. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10750.92s)]
*  14 years ago. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10751.76s)]
*  Do you think even now sometimes you say things, [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10752.6s)]
*  you're like, gosh, I shouldn't have said that. [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10754.32s)]
*  No. [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10756.56s)]
*  I don't unless it's about a person. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10759.08s)]
*  Sometimes it's about people. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10761.119999999999s)]
*  That's what we learned. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10761.96s)]
*  We learned to stop making fun of retarded children [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10762.8s)]
*  on the internet. [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10764.64s)]
*  Don't they? [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10765.48s)]
*  Well, we do sometimes, but I've had to apologize [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10766.8s)]
*  to multiple families of mentally handicapped people [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10769.36s)]
*  because we've done bits on the show. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10772.24s)]
*  And I mean, we've gotten into, [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10773.84s)]
*  where they would come to me and be like, [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10776.0s)]
*  what is wrong with you? [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10778.08s)]
*  This is like a child that has Down syndrome. [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10778.92s)]
*  We're like, we had no idea that they. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10780.88s)]
*  But then they get on the phone with Louis [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10781.72s)]
*  and they're like, I didn't mind, it was funny. [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10782.96s)]
*  The problem is parents. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10786.119999999999s)]
*  Didn't it happen? [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10786.96s)]
*  Didn't someone say to you, I know you're kidding? [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10787.779999999999s)]
*  Well no, twice now that happened. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10789.16s)]
*  And both times I ended up becoming very friendly [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10791.64s)]
*  with the family. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10793.94s)]
*  They came out to see me at shows. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10794.779999999999s)]
*  They brought the kid. [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10796.66s)]
*  Now it's your burden. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10797.5s)]
*  Because. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10798.34s)]
*  That's the problem is like you're saying things [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10799.18s)]
*  with your friends like you would normally say. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10800.82s)]
*  But then you don't realize it. [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10803.300000000001s)]
*  Ron Bangton calls it corner talk. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10804.140000000001s)]
*  Just corner talk with the guy. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10805.720000000001s)]
*  But there's a real person on the end of these stories [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10806.560000000001s)]
*  sometimes and that's the thing. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10808.54s)]
*  The only thing that's changed is I think in the beginning [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10810.0s)]
*  we would just say whatever. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10811.9s)]
*  There'd be a silly story. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10812.9s)]
*  And now I'm going like, well, all right, [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10814.060000000001s)]
*  is this person gonna hear this? [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10815.66s)]
*  And it's just a normal person who's like, [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10816.98s)]
*  their parents are raising a special needs kid. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10818.54s)]
*  It's a tough enough life as it is. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10820.42s)]
*  Buddy, I felt terrible. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10822.18s)]
*  Last time I came in here, when you talked about it, [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10823.26s)]
*  I was like, is that video going around [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10825.939999999999s)]
*  that girl freaking out? [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10826.779999999999s)]
*  And I was just going like, yeah, it's just like, [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10828.22s)]
*  she wasn't ready for this moment, [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10830.179999999998s)]
*  but I didn't say the name on purpose. [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10831.38s)]
*  And there's so many videos on the internet [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10833.74s)]
*  that are like, Jay takes a shit on this girl. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10835.099999999999s)]
*  They're like, no, it's not what I did. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10837.9s)]
*  Well, sometimes you say things because you're just talking. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10840.5s)]
*  And then you realize, [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10843.539999999999s)]
*  God, that other person's gonna hear that. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10844.38s)]
*  I did that recently. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10845.619999999999s)]
*  And I'd like to apologize to this guy. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10846.5s)]
*  There's this guy named Flint Dibble who's an archeologist. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10848.259999999998s)]
*  And I said, he attacks other archeologists [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10851.539999999999s)]
*  like Graham Hancock. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10854.38s)]
*  And he says some terrible things, [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10856.1s)]
*  but what I did was very counterproductive. [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10856.94s)]
*  What I said was like, these weak bitchy men. [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10858.380000000001s)]
*  And I named him. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10861.66s)]
*  And then he tweeted about it. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10862.66s)]
*  He said, I have stage four cancer. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10864.26s)]
*  And I'm like, fucking forgot he had cancer. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10865.9s)]
*  I didn't mean him physically. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10868.380000000001s)]
*  I meant his behavior, but it made me feel bad. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10870.300000000001s)]
*  So I was- [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10873.9s)]
*  Well, you guys got a bitch body [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10874.74s)]
*  that's gonna take over cancer. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10875.74s)]
*  I wanna tell him I was wrong. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10876.58s)]
*  What I said, I shouldn't have said. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10878.66s)]
*  There's sometimes I say things [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10880.54s)]
*  and I just think I'm talking with friends. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10881.66s)]
*  And I realize it's gonna hurt someone's feelings [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10883.26s)]
*  and it's counterproductive. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10885.1s)]
*  Like I'm doing the exact thing I'm accusing him of doing. [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10886.539999999999s)]
*  He's attacking other people. [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10889.46s)]
*  I'm attacking him. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10890.46s)]
*  It's stupid. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10891.3s)]
*  And we can be funny with anything. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10892.14s)]
*  You don't need to like- [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10892.96s)]
*  But I wasn't even being funny. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10893.8s)]
*  I was talking to an archeologist. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10894.619999999999s)]
*  I just get mad. [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10895.46s)]
*  I got angry at this process [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10896.3s)]
*  that sometimes like established archeologists [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10897.619999999999s)]
*  are attacking these people have legitimate ideas. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10899.74s)]
*  But I shouldn't have done it that way. [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10901.98s)]
*  And you just- [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10904.22s)]
*  Like archeology is your one passion. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10905.22s)]
*  No, it's like, I talk about a lot of different things, [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10907.34s)]
*  but I talk too often like I normally talk. [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10911.46s)]
*  Like sometimes when you're talking about like a serious thing, [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10915.019999999999s)]
*  like you probably shouldn't insult people. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10917.58s)]
*  It just, it comes normal. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10920.859999999999s)]
*  Like fuck that idiot. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10922.099999999999s)]
*  You know, like it comes out. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10923.06s)]
*  Sure. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10924.539999999999s)]
*  And you go, ah, shouldn't have. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10925.38s)]
*  You know? [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10927.82s)]
*  Yeah, we do that all the time. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10928.66s)]
*  You get loose. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10929.48s)]
*  You get a little too comfortable talking. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10930.32s)]
*  I tell you also, that's the smart move. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10933.179999999998s)]
*  I said that Howard Stern did years ago [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10934.779999999999s)]
*  that I'm trying to get better at and do. [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10937.019999999999s)]
*  When you think something's ridiculous, [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10939.46s)]
*  you can praise it and then use it [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10942.42s)]
*  and you can show everybody without having to make fun [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10943.98s)]
*  of it themselves. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10945.78s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10946.62s)]
*  Oh, right, right, right. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10947.460000000001s)]
*  To make fun of themselves. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10948.28s)]
*  That was the core. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10949.12s)]
*  Yeah, you can definitely do that. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10949.960000000001s)]
*  Well, I do that sometimes when I'm questioning people [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10950.78s)]
*  and I know they're not telling me the truth. [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10952.02s)]
*  And I'll say, wait a minute. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10953.94s)]
*  So what you're saying is, [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10955.26s)]
*  and so I don't even have to like say that's ridiculous. [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10956.58s)]
*  That's fucking bullshit. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10959.460000000001s)]
*  I just let the internet have it. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10960.54s)]
*  You know? [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10962.34s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10963.18s)]
*  Like Epstein didn't kill himself? [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10964.02s)]
*  You know, like that kind of a deal? [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10964.98s)]
*  Like, okay. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10966.1s)]

*  This is like, I could only be so pushy. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10970.7s)]
*  You know, when people don't wanna talk [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10974.5s)]
*  about a specific thing or wanna give you an answer [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10975.92s)]
*  that you think is pretty much gaslighting you. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10979.300000000001s)]
*  You're like, okay. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10981.5s)]

*  Just, what are you gonna do? [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10995.54s)]
*  You'll call them sometimes. [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10996.380000000001s)]
*  Sometimes. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10997.66s)]

*  Who was the guy years ago you had an argument with? [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=10999.62s)]
*  But again, sometimes when vernacular causes a problem. [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11001.78s)]
*  I feel like at the time you were just like [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11005.42s)]
*  in a rhythm of saying the word bitch [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11006.5s)]
*  at the end of a sentence a lot. [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11008.1s)]

*  And he was like, you're calling me a bitch a lot. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11012.78s)]
*  You're pulling the shit out of me. [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11015.1s)]

*  Oh yeah, that's right. [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11017.92s)]
*  It was a weed conversation. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11019.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11020.78s)]
*  I thought I was talking to him like a comedian. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11022.1s)]
*  Like he would just go along with it [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11024.62s)]
*  and he got genuinely offended. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11025.900000000001s)]
*  He's like, he's calling you a bitch. [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11027.58s)]
*  I feel like you're bullying me. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11028.82s)]
*  Yeah, we said we were bullying him [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11030.26s)]
*  because we were like researching information live [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11032.14s)]
*  that was countering what he was saying. [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11034.34s)]
*  It was trying and he didn't have access to it. [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11035.74s)]
*  It was like, all right, you know, whatever. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11037.66s)]
*  So he's being a real bitch. [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11040.38s)]
*  I was trying to be a good host and I wasn't. [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11042.5s)]
*  And I was being too like a comment. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11044.94s)]
*  Like I could talk to you that way. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11047.06s)]
*  We would have fun. [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11048.5s)]
*  I could talk to you that way. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11049.34s)]
*  We would have fun. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11050.16s)]
*  He wasn't, he was a little serious. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11051.0s)]
*  Shit, you can call those a bitch all day. [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11052.58s)]
*  Heads up. [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11053.98s)]
*  I promise some people just get. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11054.82s)]
*  Tear off on the sky. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11055.64s)]
*  If you're choking me while I jerk off [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11056.48s)]
*  you can call me whatever you want. [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11057.32s)]
*  Some people just get serious [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11059.019999999999s)]
*  and you don't realize they're serious. [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11059.859999999999s)]
*  Oh, you're serious. [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11061.26s)]
*  Like you're really upset. [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11062.099999999999s)]
*  Because we're so used to talking shit. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11063.9s)]
*  It's so normal. [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11066.06s)]
*  Like when people talk shit about me, I'm like, [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11067.34s)]
*  I would do that. [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11069.42s)]
*  They're just like, what am I gonna do? [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11070.26s)]
*  I'm gonna get mad. [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11072.06s)]
*  You're too famous to not, you can't get offended. [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11072.9s)]
*  You're so big at this point [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11074.439999999999s)]
*  that it's just part of the territory. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11076.099999999999s)]
*  That's part of the problem with saying things [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11077.74s)]
*  like about that Flint Dibble guy. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11079.74s)]
*  You don't think about it while you're saying it. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11081.06s)]
*  Like you're saying it to millions of people. [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11082.5s)]
*  It's not just talking, you know? [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11084.5s)]
*  And you're like. [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11086.46s)]
*  This guy's dusting off a raptor bone [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11087.3s)]
*  and you just see a tear hit it [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11088.82s)]
*  because he's listening to you in his headphones. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11089.9s)]
*  That guy's a dumb idiot. [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11091.46s)]
*  I genuinely feel bad. [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11092.46s)]
*  My raptor bone. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11093.58s)]
*  But it's like, [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11094.98s)]
*  I actually didn't have a bad time talking to him. [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11095.82s)]
*  We had to confront him on this one thing [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11098.06s)]
*  because he accused Graham Hancock [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11099.5s)]
*  of being attached to white supremacy [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11101.019999999999s)]
*  and this weird thing about Atlantis. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11103.46s)]
*  Like, wow, how does that have anything? [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11107.259999999998s)]
*  And he tried to deny it [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11109.099999999999s)]
*  and we pulled up the quote that he did. [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11110.46s)]
*  Because Hancock says no blacks in Atlantis. [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11112.22s)]
*  No, this is like this thing that these people do [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11114.259999999998s)]
*  when they try to discredit things. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11116.66s)]
*  Like certain academics will do. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11117.9s)]
*  Well, they'll connect what you're doing [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11119.46s)]
*  to racism or homophobia. [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11121.18s)]
*  They'll just try to like virtue-sigil their way [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11123.1s)]
*  into a position where everything you're doing is wrong. [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11126.02s)]
*  And it's the thing about Atlantis is a weird one. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11128.619999999999s)]
*  It's like, it's apparently at one point in time, [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11131.46s)]
*  there was some white supremacist [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11134.06s)]
*  that like was pushing the theory of Atlantis [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11135.58s)]
*  being this great white race. [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11138.46s)]
*  But that's not what any of the people [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11139.66s)]
*  that are legitimately trying to research it think. [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11141.94s)]
*  They think it was in Sub-Saharan Africa. [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11144.779999999999s)]
*  You think black people are gonna let their hair [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11146.74s)]
*  be wet all the time? [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11147.98s)]
*  I'm no archeologist, but I am a bitch. [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11150.42s)]
*  What do you think Atlantis is? [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11153.42s)]
*  You think they get in the water? [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11154.539999999999s)]
*  Oh, isn't it the underwater? [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11156.06s)]
*  No. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11157.179999999998s)]
*  The lost city of Atlantis? [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11158.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't idiot, right? [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11159.019999999999s)]
*  I didn't think that either, Joe. [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11160.019999999999s)]
*  Oh, what are we talking about, the Bahamas? [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11160.859999999999s)]
*  Atlantis, they believe, was this structure. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11162.34s)]
*  There was a series of concentric circles [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11165.58s)]
*  that had like a lake running through it. [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11167.82s)]
*  It's like really fascinating [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11169.539999999999s)]
*  because there's this place called the Richard Structure [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11171.34s)]
*  in South Africa. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11173.460000000001s)]
*  And this is another one of those things [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11174.78s)]
*  that archeologists will argue about. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11175.86s)]
*  Because this thing looks like Atlantis. [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11177.66s)]
*  And there's this guy named Jimmy Corsetti [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11180.9s)]
*  and he gets labeled a Nazi for talking about it. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11182.54s)]
*  It's like weird stuff, man, [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11184.3s)]
*  where they try to make you look like you're racist [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11185.78s)]
*  for pursuing this idea. [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11189.06s)]
*  I don't totally understand it. [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11190.460000000001s)]
*  And the people who defend that, [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11191.3s)]
*  if you defend a person for- [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11192.14s)]
*  You're defending racism. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11193.26s)]
*  You're defending racism. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11194.1s)]
*  It becomes this whole stupid argument [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11194.94s)]
*  that nobody really believes [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11196.9s)]
*  and it only exists on the internet. [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11198.22s)]
*  Exactly. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11199.82s)]
*  And nobody in real life gives a shit. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11200.66s)]
*  In academia, they believe it. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11201.5s)]
*  And if they don't believe it, [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11203.62s)]
*  they use it as a tool. [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11204.460000000001s)]
*  And they'll use it as a tool to dismiss you. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11205.54s)]
*  But this is one of the things that came up [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11207.94s)]
*  during that topic that when even archeologists [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11209.42s)]
*  come up with a new timeline for things [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11212.140000000001s)]
*  where it throws the old history into a tizzy, [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11214.94s)]
*  they attack them. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11218.02s)]
*  Like, and Graham Hancock brought up [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11219.1s)]
*  this concept of Clovis first. [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11221.1s)]
*  They used to think that the Clovis people, [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11223.18s)]
*  like 13,000 years ago were the first people [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11225.140000000001s)]
*  in North America. [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11227.060000000001s)]
*  And this one guy found evidence of people [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11228.380000000001s)]
*  that lived a long time ago [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11231.02s)]
*  and they fucking ruthlessly destroyed his career. [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11231.94s)]
*  They attacked this guy. [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11234.34s)]
*  It turned out he was right. [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11235.54s)]
*  And they found these footprints in White Sands, [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11236.9s)]
*  New Mexico. [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11238.54s)]
*  They're 22,000 years old of human beings. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11239.380000000001s)]
*  So they were probably living here even before that. [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11241.58s)]
*  But they destroy people that come up with an idea [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11244.66s)]
*  that throws their expertise into question. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11247.5s)]
*  And that's what they're all doing with Graham Hancock. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11250.66s)]
*  What they do is he's pointing out [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11253.58s)]
*  that there's some real evidence [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11255.7s)]
*  that perhaps there was an advanced civilization [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11257.26s)]
*  that was thousands of years older [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11259.78s)]
*  than we think civilization started at. [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11261.34s)]
*  No crime and only three pointers. [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11264.22s)]
*  Ah! [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11265.82s)]
*  Well, it is in Africa. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11267.22s)]
*  That's the fascinating thing. [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11268.26s)]
*  It's all in Africa. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11269.3s)]
*  Egypt's in Africa. [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11270.42s)]
*  You know, all this sub-Saharan stuff [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11271.66s)]
*  where they think the Richard structure. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11273.94s)]
*  Show them what it looks like. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11276.06s)]
*  It's crazy because the area when you zoom out [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11277.74s)]
*  looks like it was hit with a massive flood. [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11280.18s)]
*  Like everything looked like all water erosion. [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11282.98s)]
*  Like it was like massive amounts of water [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11285.66s)]
*  just destroyed the landscape. [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11287.86s)]
*  It still looks like that today. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11289.3s)]
*  And it's in the exact same plate. [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11292.259999999998s)]
*  Like it's the mountains are north of it. [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11293.34s)]
*  The sea is below it. [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11295.779999999999s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11297.179999999998s)]
*  And that is like the size that Atlantis is described in [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11298.42s)]
*  in Plato's recollections of it or Plato's stories about it. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11302.34s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of debate about it, [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11306.74s)]
*  but the position that it's in [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11308.019999999999s)]
*  and the weirdness of what it is [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11310.019999999999s)]
*  makes a bunch of these ancient history guys [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11312.619999999999s)]
*  that really believe in Atlantis. [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11315.14s)]
*  Just like they really believed in Troy. [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11316.74s)]
*  They thought Troy was mythical until they found it. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11319.3s)]
*  And then they're like, oh geez, Troy was a real thing. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11322.939999999999s)]
*  So there's a lot of these people [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11326.699999999999s)]
*  that are the gatekeepers of academia. [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11328.82s)]
*  And they don't want anything to be dated older [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11332.58s)]
*  than what they've established [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11336.58s)]
*  and what they've taught in lectures. [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11337.859999999999s)]
*  Oh, because everything's wrong then? [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11339.74s)]
*  Everything's wrong. [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11341.38s)]
*  Well, everything is wrong. [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11342.22s)]
*  There's weird stuff like Lebanon. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11343.22s)]
*  Have you seen those fucking stones in Lebanon? [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11345.699999999999s)]
*  There's these immense, [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11350.22s)]
*  I think they're called the Trilithon stones [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11351.74s)]
*  or the Trillian stones. [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11353.94s)]
*  They're so fucking big. [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11355.86s)]
*  And they're supposed to be, [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11359.1s)]
*  somebody's moved these from a quarry [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11360.1s)]
*  and placed them in a place. [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11361.9s)]
*  And you look at them like, how? [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11362.74s)]
*  How long ago? [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11365.02s)]
*  And then there's older stuff. [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11366.14s)]
*  There's stuff that's built on top of it. [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11367.300000000001s)]
*  Look at the size of these fucking stones. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11369.02s)]
*  I don't know if my Flintstone theory works here, [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11369.86s)]
*  but I think it's a Brontosaurus that a man is controlling. [[03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11370.9s)]
*  Baalbek, that's what it is. [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11373.380000000001s)]
*  Look at the size of these fucking stones. [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11374.58s)]
*  And if that one up in the top in the center, [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11376.1s)]
*  right to the right of that, Jamie, that one. [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11379.86s)]
*  So that shows you the size of these fucking stones [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11380.86s)]
*  that are in place. [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11384.460000000001s)]
*  If you put a person next to them, [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11385.62s)]
*  they'd be at, these are five meters high. [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11387.220000000001s)]
*  That's fucking bananas, man. [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11390.1s)]
*  How many miles per hour is that? [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11391.380000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11392.74s)]
*  Five meters, 25 feet. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11393.58s)]
*  So those are 25 feet high. [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11394.66s)]
*  15, oh sorry. [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11396.7s)]
*  Three, it's three, right, yeah, sorry. [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11397.82s)]
*  My math sucks, obviously. [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11399.460000000001s)]
*  But these stones weigh some fucking insane amount. [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11400.82s)]
*  And there's no explanation. [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11404.66s)]
*  Those corner stones, that's all one giant piece. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11405.9s)]
*  How? [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11409.1s)]
*  How the fuck did you do that? [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11410.14s)]
*  And there's a bunch of shit in Malta. [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11411.1s)]
*  They found Neanderthal bones, [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11413.26s)]
*  so maybe Neanderthals were in Malta, [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11414.9s)]
*  and maybe the land bridge was connected. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11417.02s)]
*  And there's all this confusion [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11418.94s)]
*  about the date of these ancient structures. [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11420.7s)]
*  It seems like people built other structures on top of them. [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11423.02s)]
*  And when they find stuff like this, [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11426.58s)]
*  there's this great resistance of anybody [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11429.1s)]
*  to try to say they don't understand it. [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11431.9s)]
*  They always try to come up with some sort of an explanation [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11434.7s)]
*  even when it doesn't make any fucking sense. [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11437.02s)]
*  Wasn't the Colosseum, wasn't it completely underground [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11439.98s)]
*  at one point? [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11442.460000000001s)]
*  They discovered it? [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11443.300000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11444.42s)]
*  The Sphinx was underground. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11445.82s)]
*  But the head was above it, [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11447.34s)]
*  and then they cleared out the sand. [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11448.62s)]
*  The Colosseum was- [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11450.26s)]
*  You came off stupid as shit there. [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11451.34s)]
*  I don't think it was underground, no. [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11453.220000000001s)]
*  No, the Colosseum has always been there, [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11454.94s)]
*  but they did used to be able to get water in it. [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11456.82s)]
*  They used to have water fights, [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11458.94s)]
*  they had boat fights in there. [[03:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11460.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was crazy. [[03:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11460.9s)]
*  Bro, imagine- [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11462.220000000001s)]
*  Really cool shit. [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11463.060000000001s)]
*  Watching people get eaten by lions in front of everybody. [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11463.9s)]
*  Imagine what that was like. [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11466.5s)]
*  Well, back then, they would have these games, [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11467.539999999999s)]
*  and they would bring in, they would have hunts, [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11470.859999999999s)]
*  and they would have animal fights and shit like that. [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11473.779999999999s)]
*  But it's like, back then, to see a giraffe, [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11476.019999999999s)]
*  it looked like an alien. [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11477.98s)]
*  They had no idea what it- [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11479.06s)]
*  They would bring in animals from Africa, like rhinoceros. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11480.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, these people didn't have YouTube. [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11483.06s)]
*  They were traveling. [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11484.06s)]
*  They had no idea. [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11484.9s)]
*  It was like, literally, you're watching aliens fight. [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11485.74s)]
*  Have you been in the Colosseum? [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11488.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it was incredible. [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11489.22s)]
*  Did you see those things where they lift them up [[03:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11490.06s)]
*  through the floor and the lions will pop out? [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11491.339999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they had underground, they have a whole pulley system. [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11493.179999999998s)]
*  They have elevators, and they would have slaves [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11497.38s)]
*  pulling people up. [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11498.9s)]
*  It was a whole show. [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11499.94s)]
*  It was a really cool thing. [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11500.78s)]
*  We were watching- [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11502.06s)]
*  Pre-jasing slaves lower. [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11502.9s)]

*  if they had that right now, we would watch it. [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11504.78s)]
*  If there's something on YouTube, [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11506.9s)]
*  I've already seen, have you seen the night fights [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11508.42s)]
*  where guys dress up in armor and beat the fuck out of each other? [[03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11510.54s)]
*  Harrington, Harrington. [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11512.94s)]
*  My friend's dude, yeah. [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11513.78s)]

*  It's like they look tough [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11525.58s)]
*  and then they take their helmets off [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11526.779999999999s)]
*  and they're just fucking virgins. [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11527.82s)]

*  Part of the floor of the Colosseum [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11541.38s)]

*  I knew, yeah. [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11546.539999999999s)]
*  One floor. [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11547.38s)]
*  I don't wanna correct you. [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11548.22s)]
*  The hypogemeian floor lay buried under 40 feet of earth. [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11549.06s)]
*  All memory of its function even existed. [[03:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11552.939999999999s)]
*  Is that the floor that lifts up? [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11555.26s)]
*  Is that what that is? [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11556.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the floor. [[03:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11557.859999999999s)]
*  There was stuff sticking out of it [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11559.1s)]
*  and then they went and they uncovered [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11560.539999999999s)]
*  that there was an entire underground system. [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11563.539999999999s)]
*  All this shit. [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11566.14s)]
*  Oh, all that was underground? [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11566.98s)]
*  All really recent. [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11568.38s)]
*  So did someone cover it up? [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11569.22s)]
*  Did you go back to that description, Jamie? [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11570.619999999999s)]
*  Because I think it explained that someone covered it up. [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11572.18s)]
*  Well, I mean, they destroyed most of Rome [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11574.859999999999s)]
*  so I'm sure it was part of it. [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11576.539999999999s)]
*  I wonder why they did that. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11577.98s)]
*  They were using all this shit for other stuff. [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11579.42s)]
*  The tour that I did of the Colosseum was boring as shit. [[03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11581.34s)]
*  Hey, Mussolini fixed it. [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11583.26s)]
*  That guy wasn't all bad. [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11584.98s)]
*  What were you saying, Jamie? [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11586.82s)]
*  What'd you say? [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11587.66s)]
*  They were using other pieces of the city for construction [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11588.5s)]
*  or whatever else they were building, new stuff. [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11591.179999999998s)]
*  Same with the pyramids. [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11593.14s)]
*  People shit on Mussolini. [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11594.859999999999s)]
*  Oh, god, that's horrible. [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11595.699999999999s)]
*  They go, Mussolini, what a monster. [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11596.539999999999s)]
*  I go, clean the floor of the Colosseum. [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11598.179999999998s)]
*  They did that with the pyramids. [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11600.099999999999s)]
*  They stole the fucking stones from the outside of it. [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11601.099999999999s)]
*  People are so gross. [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11604.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11605.779999999999s)]
*  Well, remember the Trevi Fountain [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11606.74s)]
*  a few years ago in Rome? [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11607.939999999999s)]
*  They poured black ink in it or something, just protesters. [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11608.779999999999s)]
*  It was like, they literally had to drain the fountain [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11612.78s)]
*  and it took like however many months to clean it. [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11615.740000000002s)]
*  It was fucked up. [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11617.78s)]
*  The Colosseum architects made changes [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11618.740000000002s)]
*  to allow new methods of stagecraft. [[03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11620.380000000001s)]
*  Other changes were accidental. [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11621.820000000002s)]
*  Fire sparked by lightning in 217 AD, gutted the stadium, [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11623.060000000001s)]
*  sent huge blocks of travertine plunging into the Hypogeum. [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11627.300000000001s)]
*  What? [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11631.1s)]
*  That whole area was so nuts, man. [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11631.94s)]
*  217, how do they have those facts? [[03:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11632.78s)]
*  Colosseum was really cool. [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11635.54s)]
*  I learned more about it. [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11636.7s)]
*  I did a gladiator training program with my son. [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11637.54s)]
*  It was a little place you went [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11641.62s)]
*  and I learned so much about the Colosseum doing that. [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11643.06s)]
*  More than the tour. [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11645.42s)]
*  The tour was boring as shit. [[03:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11646.26s)]
*  I went in August, it was 110 degrees out. [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11647.42s)]
*  It was insane. [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11649.94s)]
*  He's aggressively trying to make his son straight. [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11651.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11653.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11654.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11655.62s)]
*  But that was a cool experience. [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11657.460000000001s)]
*  It's fucking cool as shit, man. [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11660.02s)]
*  They didn't kill each other, the gladiators. [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11661.460000000001s)]
*  That's all lies. [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11663.1s)]
*  It's all lies? [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11663.94s)]
*  That's all lies. [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11664.78s)]
*  Because it was like pro wrestlers. [[03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11665.62s)]
*  If your gladiator killed another gladiator, [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11667.06s)]
*  the guy who owned that gladiator would have to pay [[03:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11669.699999999999s)]
*  the other guy who owned that gladiator. [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11673.58s)]
*  They were all slaves. [[03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11675.019999999999s)]
*  It was all just show. [[03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11675.859999999999s)]
*  It was like pro wrestling. [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11676.699999999999s)]
*  They would cut each other, [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11677.58s)]
*  but they had big fat bellies [[03:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11678.82s)]
*  so they wouldn't cut each other's organs. [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11680.82s)]
*  They do have to do it in a certain way. [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11682.3s)]
*  It was all show. [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11683.779999999999s)]
*  Really? [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11684.779999999999s)]
*  It did happen once in a while, [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11685.619999999999s)]
*  but that was more rare when you see an actual death. [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11686.439999999999s)]
*  So occasionally they would fight for real to the death? [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11688.779999999999s)]
*  I don't even, yeah, I'm sure occasionally they did. [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11691.939999999999s)]
*  Where did you get all this information? [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11693.779999999999s)]
*  From my gladiator training program. [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11694.9s)]
*  Really? [[03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11696.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11697.14s)]
*  The guy's certified. [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11697.98s)]
*  I mean, what are you gonna do? [[03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11699.699999999999s)]
*  Argue the guy's certified. [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11701.5s)]
*  But the different weapons and the costumes they would wear [[03:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11702.339999999998s)]
*  and the type of armor they would wear, [[03:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11705.339999999998s)]
*  there was like, you know, whatever, [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11706.9s)]
*  like a couple dozen different types of guys. [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11708.98s)]
*  You'd be like, oh, that's the guy with the fucking mace [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11711.859999999999s)]
*  and a certain helmet. [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11713.699999999999s)]
*  And it was free as well. [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11714.98s)]
*  All the people in Rome, there wasn't a ticket price. [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11716.82s)]
*  The government would sponsor it. [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11719.339999999998s)]
*  So it was just to get people, keep them happy. [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11720.779999999999s)]
*  And the richer you were, the closer you were. [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11723.779999999999s)]
*  All the peasants would be up in the rafters. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11726.779999999999s)]
*  So the movie Gladiators bullshit, [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11730.06s)]
*  is that what you're trying to tell me? [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11731.58s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of it's bullshit. [[03:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11732.42s)]
*  There was no thumbs down, thumbs up. [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11733.26s)]
*  What? [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11734.539999999999s)]
*  Common misconception that gladiators [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11735.82s)]
*  always fought to the death. [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11737.42s)]
*  The winner survived and the loser died. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11738.699999999999s)]
*  Very rarely, and usually with special dispensation [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11740.26s)]
*  from the emperor, would there be sign miso battles [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11742.939999999999s)]
*  which automatically meant death for the loser [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11747.22s)]
*  with no chance of being spared. [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11749.539999999999s)]
*  So occasionally they died. [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11750.74s)]
*  Very rarely they died. [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11752.82s)]
*  But they were like celebrities. [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11754.619999999999s)]
*  Like the gladiators would come out and they were like. [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11755.82s)]
*  Wow, some historians say. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11758.54s)]
*  Wait a minute, one in five died in battle. [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11760.38s)]
*  That's a lot. [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11763.18s)]
*  Others say one in 10. [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11764.02s)]
*  Most only lived to their mid-20s, [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11765.74s)]
*  which compared to today's. [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11767.78s)]
*  Well they would die of their injuries very often. [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11768.82s)]
*  It wasn't like it was fight to the death. [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11771.26s)]
*  They just didn't have medicine. [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11772.98s)]
*  Like yeah, they would get stabbed and get infected. [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11774.22s)]
*  But Gladiator 2 was right though, right? [[03:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11776.54s)]
*  I mean when he's talking about the water, [[03:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11779.66s)]
*  they would fill it up with water and have boat fights. [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11781.06s)]
*  That was a real thing in Gladiator 2. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11783.22s)]
*  Oh, I see, now I'm bummed out. [[03:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11784.5s)]
*  I thought they really fought to the death. [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11786.74s)]
*  Like every time? [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11789.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11789.86s)]
*  God damn dude, well I've got bad news about the WWF also. [[03:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11790.7s)]
*  Oh my God, you know what, I might as well pull the bandaid [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11793.74s)]
*  off if we're already here. [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11797.380000000001s)]
*  Wrestling also. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11798.58s)]
*  But it was akin to pro wrestling. [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11799.86s)]
*  They would have personalities and people would like. [[03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11802.14s)]
*  That was a problem in Japan in the early days of MMA. [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11804.86s)]
*  Some of the fights were fixed. [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11807.42s)]
*  You could tell. [[03:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11809.380000000001s)]
*  And you could tell certain guys would win by leg lock. [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11810.5s)]
*  That's where you can stomp and shit too, right? [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11813.54s)]
*  They'd have professional wrestlers, [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11815.380000000001s)]
*  like promoters do those MMA fights. [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11816.42s)]
*  What does it say, Jeremy? [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11818.54s)]
*  This is describing the animal hunts they did, [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11819.380000000001s)]
*  but I'll skip ahead to this part here. [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11821.14s)]
*  Hypogeum played a vital role in these staged hunts, [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11824.26s)]
*  allowing animals and hunters to enter the arena [[03:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11827.02s)]
*  countless ways. [[03:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11829.380000000001s)]
*  Eyewitnesses describe how animals appeared suddenly [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11830.54s)]
*  from below as if by magic, sometimes apparently launched [[03:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11833.42s)]
*  high into the air. [[03:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11836.86s)]
*  The hypogeum allowed the organizers of the game [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11837.98s)]
*  to create surprises and build suspense. [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11839.86s)]
*  A hunter in the arena wouldn't know where the next lion [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11843.1s)]
*  would appear or whether two or three lions [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11846.380000000001s)]
*  might emerge instead of one. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11848.74s)]
*  Yeah, out of those like trap doors in the bottom, [[03:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11850.060000000001s)]
*  a lion would just jump out and then, [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11852.42s)]
*  and you're watching a dude like hunt lions. [[03:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11854.060000000001s)]
*  How cool is that though? [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11856.74s)]
*  This uncertainty could be exploited for comic effect. [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11857.86s)]
*  He goes, guys, I'm not afraid of no bullshit ass lion. [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11862.18s)]
*  I fuck a lion. [[03:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11864.460000000001s)]
*  He's right behind me, isn't he? [[03:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11865.380000000001s)]
*  Ember Galenius punished a merchant who had swindled [[03:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11866.980000000001s)]
*  the empress selling her glass jewels instead of authentic [[03:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11870.34s)]
*  ones by setting him in the arena to face a ferocious lion. [[03:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11873.34s)]
*  When the cage opened, however, a chicken walked out [[03:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11877.02s)]
*  to the delight of the crowd. [[03:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11879.34s)]
*  Galenius then told the herald to proclaim, [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11881.98s)]
*  he practiced deceit and then had it practiced on him. [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11884.94s)]
*  The emperor let the jeweler go home. [[03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11888.1s)]
*  Whoa. [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11889.74s)]
*  So they let people, so it wasn't that mean. [[03:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11890.58s)]
*  Killed them days later. [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11891.74s)]
*  They were less mean than we thought. [[03:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11892.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11894.3s)]
*  It was still pretty brutal. [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11895.14s)]
*  Well, it was a fucking brutal time to be alive back then, man. [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11896.74s)]
*  Dude, one of five got to live, relax. [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11899.42s)]
*  One of ten, maybe one in ten. [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11902.06s)]
*  Maybe even one in ten. [[03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11903.58s)]
*  No big whoop. [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11904.699999999999s)]
*  But a lot of dudes were sliced up, though. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11906.14s)]
*  You ever see those Nazi dueling scars where the Nazis, [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11908.26s)]
*  when they were in military school, [[03:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11911.34s)]
*  they would have duels with sword fights [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11915.3s)]
*  and their faces would get slashed up [[03:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11917.58s)]
*  and that was their badge of courage? [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11919.38s)]
*  So all the Nazis that came over for NASA, [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11921.18s)]

*  Bro, it's so creepy. [[03:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11927.74s)]
*  They do the shit we do now in arenas, too, [[03:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11928.82s)]
*  with t-shirt guns. [[03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11930.46s)]
*  Ah! [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11931.900000000001s)]
*  Snacks fell from the sky. [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11933.140000000001s)]
*  Snacks, as abundantly as hail, one observer noted, [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11934.460000000001s)]

*  amongst spectators struggling to grab them. [[03:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11945.62s)]
*  Nothing changes today. [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11946.94s)]
*  Nothing. [[03:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11947.94s)]
*  There used to be a blimp that would go around [[03:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11948.78s)]
*  the Sixer Stadium and drop coupons for hers potato chips [[03:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11949.94s)]

*  from the smoke, sweating workmen packed [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEqyjFdQo8&t=11961.66s)]
