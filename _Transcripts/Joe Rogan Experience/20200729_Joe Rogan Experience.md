# Joe Rogan Experience #1516 - Post Malone
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 29, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G42RJ4mKj1k)
*  Give you my dog
*  That's my everybody's too high song
*  This guy's fucking high
*  Yeah
*  And we're rolling what's up
*  Got you in here man. Yeah, I'm finally here. I'm happy to be light. Huh? This is your shit. Yeah, come on
*  Cheers, sir. Cheers, sir. Why not pleasure?
*  Also precursor I haven't slept. I know we haven't slept wrong mushrooms
*  Let's roll yeah, fuck it. We'll do it live
*  Fuck it
*  Why Utah man, why you live in Utah? What's that about? I?
*  Have no idea. Are you from there? No, sir. I was born in Syracuse, New York
*  It is absolutely so I really love it. It's got a good vibe too because
*  It's this it's almost like Utah is a secret because everybody's scared of the Mormons so they don't go there, right?
*  But then you get there like Jesus Christ. It's beautiful and these Mormons are so nice. Everybody's so nice
*  Everybody's so nice in Utah and
*  You know I did so I don't remember what tour it was exactly but there were supposed to be
*  5,000 people to show up and then we end up getting to the show and there's 17,000 people so we had to move it
*  Outside of the venue right on the salt flats. Oh wow, and I was just like if this isn't a sign from
*  God or
*  You know the aliens then I don't know what is so I
*  looked at houses on Zillow and I found one and fix it all up and
*  That's awesome. Now. I've been there two years just about that's a good
*  It's a good spot for a guy like you too, because it's chill in comparison to the rest of your life, which is so crazy
*  Yeah, well, that's all shit. I couldn't do LA
*  mmm, I couldn't do LA like I
*  Moved like I said from Syracuse to Dallas and in Dallas to LA when I was 18 and I
*  It's it's a lot for me, and I couldn't focus the way that I needed to right so on your music
*  Yeah, I'm never like there's always you know before kovat. There's always something
*  Going on right like
*  24-7 like it could be 8 in the morning it could be
*  What time is it right now 2 o'clock something yeah, and then you got to go do a podcast or you got to go to like a
*  rooftop pool party or something and you know it being in Utah it's so
*  Peaceful like you said and you get to focus on the music and wake up to the mountain
*  Yeah, and the Sun sets at 10 p.m.. Which is bizarre
*  Right around this time yeah, it's just nuts. You know it is it is bizarre right like now. It's especially bizarre
*  Utah's always got a weird vibe man. Mmm like Zion National Park you go out there to the rocks and she can walk a ranch
*  I've been there have you yeah, nothing happened though. We went there for a TV show. We're like come on aliens. Where are you you fucks?
*  They weren't buying it. You don't know Tyler Tyler
*  The alien oh no yeah, that's my dog you were telling me
*  Tyler yeah, his best friend's name is Ziggy. Did they visit you in the middle of the night? No they don't they just visit me during the day
*  We just play beer pong
*  Damn if you do the right drugs you can meet the aliens
*  We were talking about that in the green room
*  If you do the right amount of mushrooms in a tank get in a flow tank you can meet aliens
*  Well, that's whenever you're most vulnerable like you said most vulnerable most most susceptible to well
*  That's that's why I like weed you know we were talking about weed makes you vulnerable and I think for someone like me
*  That's a good thing to like think that way to think sure think
*  Just just look at all the vulnerabilities and just the reality of life and the temporary nature of it
*  Which it makes me more appreciative right like the fear actually makes me more appreciate
*  But mushrooms are a different animal man. They just bring you to this weird place. That's like right next door right now
*  It's like it's like a hall pass to this other place like you get like a VIP bracelet you get to go into another room
*  That's right there all the time
*  But you can't go in until you get that bracelet
*  Yeah, and that's the whole thing like I I've been doing these micro doses for a while, and you don't really
*  Catch it until you do like ten
*  Like right off the rip mm-hmm, but then I ate these chocolates the other day some shroomies chocolates and
*  Me and my my producer Lou we made a a Coachella set for about two hours
*  Based off of the roblox you know roblox yes, I have girls young
*  You know the death sound of roblox no, what's this down?
*  That's what happens if you die yeah, and then I sampled it and we made a whole two hours set off of the deal
*  Fucking four to the floor kick drum, and it was the time of my life wow
*  And I felt like I got that VIP
*  Wristband mmm, and I was backstage at Ziggy and Tyler's concert the aliens
*  Do you feel like that sometimes when ideas come to you when you fucked up like it's almost like
*  Like it's a gift from somewhere. I have no idea I think
*  All of my ideas are kind of like mistakes
*  It's like
*  Because you never wake up and say today. I'm gonna write
*  the you know congratulations or any or any song and
*  You kind of just it's it's all about like
*  Right moment right time like I had oh, I had like eight Bud lights right and then I took
*  Just a tiny bit of shrooms, and then here. It's like
*  And
*  Then it just happens yeah, there's it's it's like
*  It is an accident it is just like a
*  spur-of-the-moment type deal to where you're like let me
*  sing this
*  melody over this beat or let me make this be even and
*  It just kind of happens. I don't know
*  Well, that's the flow state right when you just you can get out of your own way
*  And you can let ideas come to you
*  Like I was talking with this dude
*  His name is Joe Desena. He runs a Spartan race. He's a really smart guy very interesting guy
*  He does a lot of stuff for kids
*  He's got all these kid programs these kids do like difficult tasks and it like to do it over a summer camp to get some
*  Better, but we were talking about it
*  And we were talking about being healthy and all the benefits of being healthy sure and I was like this
*  There's a lot to that, but there's also a lot to like the person who binges
*  And create something incredible we were talking about Stephen King's books
*  Sure, like some of the ones he doesn't even remember right are the best ones because he was on coke and drinking a fucking case
*  A bud like you just blasted out of his head chain smoking cigarettes, and he doesn't even remember writing
*  I think it's Kujo doesn't even remember writing it
*  Like wrote Carrie half blacked out you read that book today, man. That is one of the fucking hard
*  Stephen King's fan Stephen King fan dude and then he's amazing but
*  I mean at the end of the day. It's like
*  To each his own you know what I mean. I mean whatever gets you through the through the night
*  No, some people can definitely do it straight, and you know I've definitely had ideas without any influence of anything before right
*  But I feel like sometimes things come to you when when you're like a little high at least right a little drunk
*  And they're like I don't know if I would have ever thought about this right the weed
*  They just come out of nowhere
*  That's what and that's and that's the whole thing too like drinking rose or drinking
*  You know bud light and then a little bit of just the something else yeah, whether it be you know
*  Smoking a little bit of a jay cuz I'm an anxious person you told me before you're not an anxious person
*  But really but I used to smoke a lot
*  But now not so much. Maybe I'll smoke watch a funny movie mm-hmm and then shit, but
*  It's it's
*  That stroke genius, and you're like if I was
*  Not nothing in my blood right now, but just blood mmM
*  No
*  Booze no
*  Anything would I have thought of that mmm, and that's it. That's the whole different deal. It's it's
*  It's wild really I think a pot the way I think a wakeboarding
*  Sure
*  It looks awesome right when they're on that and they're catching those waves
*  But then when they wipe out man they go down hard like weed
*  So you're not gonna stay on that board forever if you think you're really fucked up that boards gonna flip over and you're gonna
*  Whenever you rip that big-ass trick you do the behind-the-back
*  double spin
*  That's the stroke of genius, and that's
*  That's what I think that
*  there's a certain magic that goes into making a record or
*  You know if you're a painter a painting or if you're a dancer a fucking cool dance move
*  I think they're all related in some way. Yeah, there's something there that yeah
*  It just kicks off, and you can't control it, and you can't
*  Say when it's gonna happen, but it just happens whatever that is that that makes humans so interesting creating things that other people can enjoy
*  But that's that's what it is
*  It's like there's a weird frequency
*  Humans creating things that they know other people gonna enjoy and if you can just get lost in the beauty of just creating the thing
*  And get out of your own way then these
*  Ideas will come to you, but if you get in your own way you have less bandwidth for the ideas
*  When they come to it they it feels like this isn't even yours like it's like you're interacting with something
*  These ideas just like if you have an idea for like an five and I'm dear for a new bit or something like that
*  Sometimes they just come from nowhere. Yeah, where'd that come? Yeah? What is this? Yeah? What is that? Where are premises from?
*  What's an idea from it's like?
*  Creativity comes from the weirdest part of your brain that no one knows how to I mean you there's like you can have breathing
*  Exercises you could do all sorts of things to try to stimulate it right the reality is you can't even measure it
*  No, you don't know when it's up when it's down. You just know what you're doing if you're making some cool shit
*  Yeah, well and it's so that's so bizarre like to think about like you said it's just really
*  Humans creating something that other humans fuck with yeah, that's exactly what it is makes and that makes you feel good
*  That's the most there's something there. Yeah, when you see like when you're in concert, and you see
*  15,000 right rocking out to your song right like that has got to be a crazy feeling yeah
*  Yeah, well whenever you know you're on the podcast everybody's seeing you whenever you kicking somebody in the face
*  There's a there's a feeling there, and it's just like oh
*  I realize finally. I'm not actually just one person mmm. Yeah, I as
*  as like
*  A mithril as it sounds I'm with everybody you were as well as in one moment in time
*  Everybody is there doing the same thing with the same energy the same good intention. Yes, it's it's it's
*  Fucking magical you know it's weird. Yeah, that's what you're doing right you're tapping into some magic
*  I'm trying, but that's what it is
*  If you if you think about what kind of alchemy is involved in making the right sounds to make people feel different
*  Because with a great song man you're giving a person a drug
*  You know there's a there's a dopamine rush you get goosebumps a great song will hit you like you when you're doing that man
*  You're hitting that audience
*  15,000 people and they're all
*  Vibing on this thing that you've created like that's kind of magic it's fucking magic, and that's the coolest thing
*  Existed you would never believe someone could do it like what are you talking about if there's no music at all imagine a world with no
*  Music right animals right never figured out how to make melodies and bars and songs that you're right there
*  We're just animals right someone told you hey man
*  There's just I'm gonna make some sounds and people gonna lose and be shit
*  They're gonna be 15,000 people are gonna get a man. I always I always think about this too, and this is a weird thought
*  You know how like there's famous people throughout history
*  Yeah, how the fuck do they know what they look like like think about like in like Wild West Times
*  When they see a dude in the bar, and he's like oh, you're crazy bill. I've seen you
*  How does that work? How do they even know it was that guy?
*  How do they even know and then and then even somebody could say oh?
*  I'm crazy bill. Oh yeah, but then how do you even believe them well?
*  There's some pot there was some posture people all up until the internet
*  You know there's like you can't be a fake Post Malone today, but you could in 1970 you could play it off
*  Like didn't know what then you have to think about these stories that people tell and think if it's the imposter if it's a real dude
*  Right there's probably a lot of fuckery when it comes to like Wild West stories
*  Or think about even 1600s like mm-hmm. Oh this dude. It was crazy with a battle axe or something
*  Cut like nine dudes in half with one swing right, but it's the wrong dude right
*  it's not even fucking William the the
*  Whatever he is
*  Right I don't that one some no just a cool. What's a little word one?
*  What's a cool name for a dude who swings battle axes other than the behemoth?
*  the slicer
*  It was Charlie the slicer
*  Oh, it's hilarious you gotta think there's no way to tell but just imagine history before pictures
*  What are you talking about draw me a picture?
*  This is what the boats would look like when they would pull how the fuck do you know like it was an abstract idea?
*  Yeah, you were the only way you could see something was someone had a draw it for you, right?
*  Well, that's what I love to think like it used to be like Instagram filters essentially like oh, I'm a rich dude
*  I want this artist to paint me
*  Make me skinny
*  Like make me ripped yeah, yeah, maybe a little more handsome. Give me a bigger dick in my statue
*  We have no idea what anybody really looked like
*  I
*  Mean imagine if there was like this one guy you would go to in the neighborhood and all the ladies like you got to
*  Go to him who makes your ass look so perfect and like that's how they would get their picture done
*  This dude would paint some nonsense version of them this yeah, no one knows how do you know you bet?
*  I wasn't mirrors barely work back then I wasn't mirrors were probably terrible back then
*  They're looking at shit through fire right that's the only way they lighting room up. It's fire. They're little lamps everywhere
*  Preposterous they have no idea what they look doesn't work. No doesn't work
*  So imagine this is this is how ballsy people were in like the 1400s
*  There were people that would get in a boat and travel across a fucking ocean
*  It would take weeks and weeks and weeks based on a drawing and some shit someone wrote down. Yeah, it's fucking insane
*  Insane, you don't even know where the fuck you are insane. Also, there's some salty dogs and some rapscallions
*  What's what's another pirate term
*  Yeah, I was reading about pirate landlubber the coast of South Carolina. Was it blackbeard?
*  Is he with the big one?
*  It just makes you think like Jesus Christ
*  like these are real people that would get like real famous dudes who'd get in boats and
*  Show up and just fuck people up and steal all their shit. They were so famous for doing that
*  So crazy and it's so funny you bring up blackbeard because I saw
*  Somebody had like some kind of sash or like
*  Like like a Miss America like a bandolier
*  It was looked like you had a bunch of like black powder pistols like you got one shot and then you're out
*  Mm-hmm, like yeah, it's so funny. That wasn't a long ago man
*  Does the eight early 1800s when they came up with a revolver?
*  The Colt came up with the revolver and they didn't even really put it to use until the Texas Rangers
*  The Texas Rangers figured out how to there's a guy named Jack Hayes
*  I think he's the original Texas Ranger and basically is this badass dude who?
*  Figured out how to fight the Indians on their turf
*  They were basically like like the Navy SEALs of the Texas Frontier guys who fought against the Comanche's
*  And this guy figured out how to use a revolver that wasn't that long ago. That's like 1840 it
*  It's moving so fast. You know what they say, you know, they say God made man Samuel Colt made him equal
*  Yeah, that's a fucking great statement. That's what Colt invented the revolver
*  They're the ones who invented the I think was a five-shot revolver
*  There's the first time they figured out how to fight the Comanche's they would they would ride on a horse
*  It stay on the horse
*  They didn't get off to shoot and they could shoot five times in a row and they had a bunch of those cartridges
*  So they get the cartridges are already loaded
*  So they take it off put a new cartridge in fully loaded and lock it in sure it was the whole it was the whole wheel
*  Yeah, the whole wheel. So you only carry a few of those with you crazy shit, man. It's so
*  bizarre how much
*  shit has
*  Evolved to kill each other in since 1840
*  It's fucking insane insane and even you think about even before whenever you had musketeers and shit
*  Yeah, and you would just stand in a line
*  and
*  You would shoot and then a dude behind you would shoot and everybody's just shooting looking right at each other ridiculous
*  It's it's it. It's
*  the craziest fucking shit
*  They fought like that for a long time man
*  They fought with honor and dignity like they would show up below trumpets when it was time to fight and then they'll go fight each other
*  They'd all stand in a line. Yeah two guys talk
*  You had two guys walk up and talk now go back and then everybody else would just shoot each other
*  Point blank like you're doing it's it blows my mind
*  You know, it's crazy too
*  There was a lot of them would a lot of them would they would give up and they would
*  Surrender and they would hand the man their sword and they would accept it and shake their hand
*  They had like weird rules of combat that everybody sort of adhered to back then. It's very strange to read about
*  it's
*  It's different. It's different as fuck, but it's not that long ago. That's what's crazy
*  It's like the best you could do is shoot someone with a musket or a cannon right just a couple hundred years ago, right?
*  That's I mean that's manageable. It's it's it's nuclear weapons are man. Yeah now now
*  It's like one nuclear bomb ruin your whole day. Yeah
*  That's not manageable at all. It's it's awful
*  Tyler Tyler and Ziggy are looking down at us right now. My aunt those are my that's why they're here
*  I agree. I agree wholeheartedly. I think they're like these dummies are gonna do something stupid if aliens are real
*  I'm not a hundred percent convinced, but I'm probably like 90 percent convinced, but if they are real I leave in the room for bullshit
*  It's like
*  Jamie get a picture of your shirt
*  Show everybody this shirt you're wearing while we're talking about that
*  It's a UFO says can they see it?
*  Believe that that's a dope shirt
*  That's a saucer if I've ever seen one I think if they're if they're here, they're not gonna let us that's what I think
*  Well, that's what I think they're gonna swoop in and go. Hey. Hey. Hey
*  Well, that's fuck. I'm 25 right? I can't speak on anything but just looking from
*  past experience and
*  You know, there's like drawings like even in the Mona Lisa. There's a weird thing or whatever in the
*  shit
*  But there's a spike
*  It's a spike in like
*  Because it's getting pretty weird here the spike they think it's hard to tell because sometimes when people talk about UFOs a bunch of
*  Other people hallucinate or lie like there's a lot of that, right?
*  So every time there's a real legit UFO you get a bunch of nut
*  Just nut cases who just want to tell crazy shit about being taken and I see more ships
*  I mean, I never yeah, would you say what it looks like?
*  I was in I was
*  probably 16 I was at in upstate New York and
*  It would just stay there so I whoa, let me precursor this
*  My aunt and uncle were very strict and we had to go to bed at a very strict deadline probably 10 p.m
*  and
*  I was looking out the window with my cousin and it's just a light
*  That just stays there and then just fucking goes off I mean you it just
*  You can't explain it
*  Well, if you're seven you're 17 at the time 16 16 how
*  probably
*  How strong is this memory when you're like looking at it when you try to remember medium medium? Yeah. Yeah
*  But I mean there's something there for sure something took off and did something that didn't make sense to you for sure
*  And then in Utah, I mean their shit happens all the time. I mean even here in LA I can't
*  Tell you how many times because I used to live in Tarzana
*  so
*  There was like a balcony here and it looked kind of like
*  It sounds corny
*  but like a classic like force field whenever you think of a force field and
*  It just kind of goes like this and it's kind of like a dome
*  In a circular shape
*  Mm-hmm, and it just goes like this and goes back in well
*  in Tarzana
*  Looking down at the fucking city and I'm like, how did no one else see this?
*  They might have but I was there with like fucking four other people and they saw it too. The thing about
*  Unique events is if a unique event happens and it never happens again. It's hard to remember
*  It's hard to be sure what you saw it's hard
*  But if aliens are visiting us like how often are they doing it like unique events would probably be what it would be right?
*  I feel like occasionally right once every six months someone sees one somewhere, but they're here all the time
*  They probably just know how to evade detection. I
*  Mean it just if something can travel here from another planet. It's gonna be able to know
*  Yeah, when they're being watched and when they're not being watched, that's not gonna be hard
*  That's why you got to wonder if it's like intentional
*  I think there's enough talk about it now that we're probably gonna find out what it is in our lifetime
*  I never would think that before I think the government withheld information for whatever reason maybe they think people are scared
*  maybe they think it's a threat to govern to you know, the
*  National security to have a bunch of people worried that aliens are flying around us all the time. There's nothing we can do about it
*  Maybe they like had a conversation and they thought maybe be better to keep people in the quiet or keep them in the dark
*  So that they don't freak out because there's nothing we could do about it
*  Anyway, if we just tell them that there's aliens that are visiting us all the time, right?
*  That's not gonna be good. They're not gonna pay attention to taxes and
*  Mortgage rates and the stock market. They care about uranium and shit like that. They're around us all the time
*  They're gonna be people are gonna freak out
*  So I think like little drops of like this the recent one they said well they yeah, what did the Pentagon just say?
*  Yeah, literally like they said fucking days ago. They've recovered
*  Crafts that are not from this world
*  Not made on earth not made on earth. Yeah, not made on earth
*  They're basically saying we don't know what the fuck it is, but we didn't make it
*  That's bananas and I think that's gonna lead to more and more information coming out about it. Well, we're gonna
*  Try to get a sense of understanding how long have they known this?
*  You know how much of like all that Roswell, New Mexico shit was true. I tell us what was going on and
*  It backtracking you got to wonder if like oh
*  We've been hiding this the whole time. Yeah, this is the first time for real
*  that
*  We don't know. This is what I like to think
*  I like to think that the people that are in charge at the Pentagon are patriots and they realize it's probably better
*  Especially when you're dealing with the United States, it's in this kind of turmoil that they're in right now. It's crazy between
*  racial turmoil and turmoil with the police and turmoil with
*  People protesting in cities and blocking traffic. There's so much crazy turmoil
*  They'd be like no one's even gonna notice now. Just let it say it now to say yeah
*  We got UFOs like everything is so crazy the news cycle of any crazy story
*  This is only a few days and then people forget well
*  or
*  it's just
*  people already know and it's just normalization or you and you think about movies is just
*  normalizing you to the idea that I
*  can't even
*  like the Canadian I don't quote me on this but a
*  Canadian someone in office was like there's like seven species of aliens in the US government
*  It would be crazy if it was true that's you know, Tommy Lee Jones and will do you remember that all along?
*  Yeah, check that out. Please fact check that for me a loony person though. I have no idea
*  See people can get elected and still be crazy
*  That's a problem, you know just because like when you hear about someone having like a really high-profile job and they say something crazy
*  It doesn't mean they're not crazy just because they're the prime minister of some fucking country
*  That's a problem, you know, they're not crazy just because they're the prime minister of some fucking country they could be out of their mind
*  What do we got?
*  Something close to that how close?
*  Canada's former defense minister claims that aliens are real apparently there's a humanoid esque race of aliens called the tall whites
*  living among us
*  Huh?
*  To what publication is this vice?
*  Like a real it's a like a real deal
*  Come on that's crazy shit
*  Yeah, that is crazy shit. The thing is is that guy nuts? Like what else does he believe in?
*  You know, how does he feel about ghosts? All right, do you believe in ghosts?
*  I
*  Don't not believe I don't not believe in ghosts I've never experienced the ghost ghosts are real
*  But I can't I can't explain it they might be they might be real but I don't know if it's a ghost
*  Here's the thing about ghosts. There's so many stories of them, right?
*  There's so many right now
*  Is it because people are just scared and their fucking?
*  Senses are on heightened alert and they see things that aren't really there that could be it because when it's dark out and you're tired
*  And you're moving through the hallway. First of all, you you might be half asleep anyway, but you hear things you get scared
*  Your senses get really heightened and maybe you might see something that's not even really there, right?
*  It's just your your own brain and your paranoia fucking with you because it's always happening at night under low light conditions
*  It's always weird things that are fleeting and then they're gone, but it's not always
*  It's not always in the night it's always in the dark door, right? No, I like at the beach as a ghost
*  I don't there might be goes at the beach
*  There's no ghost at the beach
*  Your house is just as haunted in the day as it is at night
*  But why not the beach listen the beach at night is scary the beach during the day not scary at all
*  If you're a girl and you're walking on the beach at night, that's a fucking dangerous place to be right
*  There's a lot of psychos out there and serial killers and creeps and rapists you just walking on that beach by yourself
*  That's scary at night, right? But in the day it's awesome the day you're just walking on the beach
*  I'm not a beach guy anyways. I'm a mountain guy
*  There might be some more creepy guys in the mountain. That's another one, but they're more sparse
*  Everything's scary in the woods, but I'm saying
*  Your house is just as this place this building is just as haunted in the daytime as it is at night time
*  I don't think this one's haunted
*  I've been here at night
*  Here's an argument for something being haunted the comedy the comedy store in Hollywood because it used to be C. Rose nightclub
*  It used to be owned by Bugsy Siegel and apparently the word is they killed a bunch of fucking people there, right?
*  And almost everyone that I know that works there everyone who's managed it works there a long time
*  They have some weird shit happen to them weird shit
*  Like they they see someone in the kitchen and they go to say something to them
*  They turn around and then they turn back in the person's gone
*  Right weird shit right like old friends
*  You haven't seen forever wandering through the hallway and they go up the stairs and you can't find them
*  There's like a bunch of stories like that now
*  Granted there's a lot of people who've done a lot of drugs at the comedy store, right?
*  That has to be factored in right, but there's so many stories worldwide of ghosts. I don't think it's impossible
*  To I think it's possible that
*  Things leave a memory right like maybe if you hate someone so much
*  You you leave a memory on the space like it's a stone. Yeah theory. Yeah the what stone tape. Yeah stone tape
*  Yeah, what is that that the energy of a life is like?
*  left on
*  Material shit like the bricks on the wall. Yeah, or the curtain here, right?
*  You know and that's like I don't know if that's a stone tape theory. Don't quote me on don't quote me on that
*  Look, can you look up the quote? Can you look up the stone tape theory for me stone tape?
*  but it's well because I'm I'm
*  Friends with Zach Baggins from Ghost Adventures, right?
*  And it's like did he ever take you to a haunted house
*  We we did a whole episode you should check it out scared. It's terrifying
*  It's terrifying man
*  In his museum, so apparently there's a thing called the dibbock box, which is a one of the most
*  Haunted items in the world apparently
*  and
*  He wanted to so we took
*  the glass case off of the dibbock box, which is in his museum in Vegas and
*  He thought it was a sick-ass idea to put the ashes of a lady who died while she was possessed on top
*  whoa, and then I
*  was
*  My plane almost crashed. I was in a car accident
*  my house got robbed and I had bite marks on my arm and
*  And
*  He hit the wall likes like I've never seen someone in fear so hard as
*  whenever he touched it and
*  It's it's I don't know if it's someone who's dead or if it's a demon or if it's fucking something dimensional
*  But it's something there that
*  Goes bump in the night, I suppose
*  Stone tape theory. What is that?
*  Haunted rocks of stone tape theory the stone tape theory is frequently used as a science sounding quasi explanation to explain amateur to explain hunting
*  Okay
*  Sound and apparitions that do not interact directly with people instead. They play out like a movie or recording
*  The most commonly turned residual haunting see this is what I was saying like two for two by the way
*  When you think about like an alien sighting like if you saw an alien
*  They never saw one again for the rest of your life
*  You would be you it would fuck with your memory
*  Even if the alien was real if a saucer right in front of you then took off
*  That's the same thing with a ghost
*  Like if you saw a fucking ghost if you walked into your basement to go get into a screw for something and you turn and you
*  Saw an apparition of a woman right who's like staring you don't see that where Mo del Toro movie about the lady
*  Who's a ghost who adopts kids? No, dude. It's a dark movie. What is it called mother?
*  What is it called? It's fucking
*  Creepy it's like horror movies of them me too. I love I'm a dirty little bitch
*  I love
*  Mama yes, that's it. Oh is that
*  That's not with two Swedish kids, right? Um, I don't this is it this is it. Did you see this?
*  No, just two kids. I haven't seen that she's um, she well, I don't want to give it away
*  I don't give the story away, but it's crazy. She finds these kids in the woods and raises them
*  She's a ghost and it's a sure
*  terrifying
*  Wait, is that a spoiler kids they find the kids I can't tell you anymore spoiler alert
*  I can't tell you anymore. No, you know, she's a ghost from the very beginning of okay. Okay good. Yeah, this is terrifying dude
*  It's fucking horrifying. It's a terrifying move. Well, you get the best of both worlds, right?
*  You get a creepy like mom style and then you get creepy kids which are like the double terrifying
*  Without well spoiler alert in it
*  There's a I think it may be called it might become
*  so it's two kids it might be Swedish or
*  Like Norwegian or something
*  Is it the vampire movie? No, there's a little there's a vampire movie a foreign vampire movie
*  Is it let the right one in I think it is or is that the American version of it?
*  Let the right one in is a scary movie. That's a scary movie, right? That's a vampire movie about vampire kids, right? Yeah
*  Yeah, see the thing about a ghost is
*  If you saw one and it was if they're just real every now and then you saw one and it was right in front of you
*  You're in the woods. We're going to walk your dog and you see some old man with no legs floating in front of you
*  One good night. Mommy. Yeah
*  Good night. Mommy. What's this one about?
*  Same kind of deal. Oh
*  Jesus Christ
*  Did you see something good yeah, I missed a scary lady in the corner check that motherfucker out, okay
*  I'm scared, but you see him in the woods. Yeah
*  Please oh, yeah, if you saw some
*  Some apparition in the woods and then you never saw it again for the rest of your life
*  It doesn't mean it wasn't real right just means it's really rare that that happens
*  Like that's the thing about a unique event like imagine if you're an ant your whole fucking life
*  All you've ever known is this an hill everybody's chillin working every day chopping up leaves going out and getting
*  Popcorn or whatever shit it funds and then one day some person comes along like Post Malone
*  Just stomps the fuck out of that ant hill to that moment
*  All that thing has ever known was that that an hill never even knew that it was possible
*  For something that could because it's been alive for a couple weeks during that couple weeks
*  No one's ever stomped on the an hill, but then it happens
*  And then you realize that there's no pattern to these things anything can happen
*  Like if you're if you're a person aliens can land yeah land on the White House lawn tomorrow and take over the world
*  And there's nothing we can do about it like that could be our new normal
*  Okay, fuck masks the new normal is there's alien spaceships that hover over every city
*  And they tell you what to do and you have to work for them now forever to the ant argument
*  We're smarter than ants yes, we are but we're in comparison probably dumber than aliens are like we're
*  Dumber in comparison to aliens then ants are to people well. That's right you like all these
*  Celestial sightings yeah, I mean this is all
*  Spitballing here, but it could be possible right celestial sightings
*  Documented throughout history history you
*  Hey, I just made a fire this is dope right fires cool
*  But what the fuck is that that has to be yeah God like man has always looked up
*  For answers it's true, and so that's that's that's why it's a scary thing
*  Do you guys do they want to hurt us or do they are they did we come from them I?
*  Don't think it's impossible. I don't think it's impossible
*  I don't think it's impossible. I don't think it's impossible that we're a product of genetic manipulation
*  I don't know if we are I know we're definitely primates. We're just playthings
*  Maybe we just look so different than every other monkey all the other monkeys are covered in hair
*  This is this weird semi hairless monkey
*  You know who knows how to use electronics who knows how to send you video through the sky Anunnaki yes
*  Yes, yes
*  My yeah, if Lou is here. I got a great friend Lou shout out to Lou he would talk
*  About this whole deal about this to an actual archaeologist yesterday or the Nethel em Garret
*  Yeah, the Nethel em or the Anunnaki from planet Nibiru all that Zacharias Hitchin stuff you ever read those books
*  No, sir the books are weird man. You know it's weird like there's stuff that he was saying in
*  Like I believe it was like the 1970s where he was deciphering these
*  Texts and one of the things that he said is
*  This is the craziest one of all
*  Humans were genetically engineered from lower primates, and they were used to harm to harvest gold and
*  That the Anunnaki needed gold because gold is very plentiful here right and very hard to find very rare on
*  Their planet right and they engineered humans to mine
*  That's why people love gold so much right if you think about like the usefulness of gold right gold
*  Isn't even remotely it's unless you're making electronics like gold's not the best metal like why is it so valuable because it's pretty
*  What's not even the prettiest shit like?
*  Rubies are prettier than gold emeralds are prettier than gold why it's gold so goddamn expensive
*  Where does diamonds fit in it's a good question probably just someone tricked a chick. They're thinking it was I I was reading about like
*  Yeah, that's what it's like one movie. She had a diamond and then
*  Booty popped let me finish what I'm saying because this is where it gets weird
*  They said that they needed it to hang in their atmosphere to protect them from the Sun
*  Because they were losing their atmosphere well
*  we're losing our atmosphere and one of the things that scientists have suggested is
*  hanging reflective particles
*  Above above the earth like putting them in orbit all like a reflective dust in orbit
*  So that it would mute out some of the effects of the Sun so what they suggested what he was saying in
*  1978 is what they suggested in like
*  2018 right so when they're talking about how to fix some of the global warming issues
*  They were literally saying some of the stuff that was in this book that he was reading a you know he's deciphering the
*  These ancient Sumerian text from 6,000 years ago. No shit. Yeah, I don't know
*  I was about to ask where did he get it from?
*  He is just a guy who's a linguist who studies these ancient languages and in and reinterprets them
*  But it's very highly in dispute. That's the problem like you are not you are you or I we're not gonna figure it out
*  We're not gonna know who's right. It's too complicated right, but there's a website called sitin is wrong
*  Comm and if you go there refutes all of this credit
*  I don't know who's right or who's wrong, but it's interesting to see the argument, but again
*  What the whatever the fuck was going on back then at six thousand years ago whatever was going on
*  They were writing about some wacky shit right right right you know they weren't is that the shrooms or is that is it contact?
*  Yeah, you know is that's it's not impossible
*  They we could have easily been contacted by some of their life form that's similar to us
*  But that's a million years advanced right have been contacted all throughout history right yeah
*  All right up until 1860 whatever the fuck it was all you would have is a drawing and a story imagine that how
*  Famous people who the fuck knows but now
*  If you look at the last 200 years it is accelerated like a motherfucker and
*  There's so much like
*  200 years ago people would look at
*  The Bronco or anything like that and be like what the fuck yeah, what is that it happened so quick?
*  It's happening so quick right now I
*  Mean they that SpaceX thing they've already they've figured out how to get something to fly into the sky
*  And then bring it back and land it. It's insane. Yeah
*  We are in a weird fucking time, and if the aliens come right now
*  It's probably the best time to come we're gonna be the most relaxed about it
*  The most relaxed about it no one's been able to work for six months. Yeah, I feel like everybody's oh people are scared to shake hands
*  What are you gonna do terrified? Are you gonna say hi? Are you gonna? Are you gonna grab your bow? Oh?
*  I'm gonna say hi for sure. I'm not stupid
*  Yeah, I'm not even interested in kicking someone's ass from another dimension. I just want to say hi
*  Tell me what's up. Tell me what's actually I want to have an alien on the podcast
*  Imagine I could call Tyler up three foot tall
*  40 pound dude with a giant bulbous head and like
*  Antenna like fingers and he's explaining how they traverse space
*  You imagine they're making sounds and you interpret those sounds no matter what language you're in all over the world you
*  Instantaneously interpret what they're saying brain you wouldn't be able to hear them. They would do it through a podcast
*  They would engineer the sounds they make
*  They would do it through SM78's
*  They would hit you with some sound that's so complex you would understand exactly what they're saying even though you don't know the language
*  And everybody would be like what in the fuck is going on. Oh my god. There's an alien on the JRE
*  That's what it would be me talking to some alien
*  They better they better give you some more goddamn money
*  I think that's the least of our problems and the aliens come
*  That shit is gonna be wiped. Well, that's when we need gold. Yeah, we're gonna be gold miners again folks
*  We're gonna look for some sturdy person with a wide back
*  That's what that's what's gonna be valuable. Thank you, but I mean good enough to mine gold. I don't know
*  Imagine if that's life in the future they come down the gate you get two choices eat one we eat you
*  To you mine gold for us. Are they eating?
*  Why not? Why wouldn't they eat us? They'll be like listen you guys just protein your assholes. They probably eat clouds
*  Yeah, or like energy they probably just eat energy. Yeah, they maybe they just exist in some sort of like dude
*  They're probably not even fucking material probably they're probably just fucking ethereal
*  Well, maybe they figured out a way to make life
*  So maybe they figured out a way how to make life where you can transfer your consciousness in some eternal
*  mechanical thing
*  This is what?
*  There's this oh my god, I can't remember his name Ray Kurzweil. Sorry. He's a guy that's upset. He's a scientist
*  He's an inventor. He's got like a hundred patents genius guy
*  Maybe not a hundred but a lot and he is obsessed with downloading his consciousness into a computer
*  He's obsessed with the idea of technology reaching a point where you could replicate a
*  human being
*  In a way where you will never die your consciousness will actually transmit to some sort of a
*  computer or an artificial body or another body that's they've genetically engineered and he believes this is like he's saying you have to
*  Look at the exponential rate of technology right now. That doesn't make any sense, right? But if you go ten years from now
*  Ten years is gonna the ten years time is gonna be like a hundred years of progress
*  Exponential snowballing ten years after that a thousand years right progress like 20 years from now
*  I don't know if those are the right numbers, but 20 years from now or somewhere in that range
*  We could be looking at artificial life. We could be 30 years from now. We could be looking at fake people
*  They're already cloning goats
*  Yeah, they've done sheep. Yeah, dolly the sheep
*  Yeah, I bet they're cloning people
*  Must be 100% 100% you don't think Russia is cloning people right now. You don't think China's cloning people right now
*  Why wouldn't they I think we're cloning people
*  Well, if you think of the people that do that treat human beings with the least amount of respect
*  If those like if you think the way they treat their citizens those people are likely to clone people
*  They're not gonna give a fuck. They're gonna want to give a quick quick to the jump. Yeah, we don't give a fuck
*  I don't think anybody
*  it's
*  it's a matter of
*  It does honestly feel like oh
*  everybody's
*  Just a gold miner
*  In a way because we're mining technology everybody. I mean even even you sitting on your phone. You're yeah contributing
*  100% yeah, and then they're learning and you want a new phone you want a new phone next year
*  So you work hard buy that new phone right and you want to test it because it's got that big old electronic screen
*  It's a car and the whole machine I wouldn't can I have a one of your beard hairs
*  I'm working on something at home. I could give you some it's cool. I'm later. I can't pluck them
*  They're not big enough to come on. I'm working on my cloning device. It doesn't work necessarily
*  It might work dude if it works. Let me know if there's a little me running around
*  I tell him a lot of shit. I got wrong
*  Kicking everybody I feel like dude you gotta calm down
*  Calm down son, but like I think genetic engineering. They've already definitely done that they've figured out how to
*  I think it was China that did some sort of CRISPR experiment on people's DNA
*  That figured out how to make them immune from AIDS, but also simultaneously made them smarter
*  So made my immune to HIV a pretty I'm pretty sure that's what it was
*  What's a crisp crisp Oh crisper some gene editing tool? I don't know what the it's an acronym, right?
*  I don't know what it stands for but it's
*  It's a new gene editing tool that they've discovered over the last few years
*  They understand genes better because I believe because of bacteria
*  I'm sure I'm fucking this up, but they figured out how to make a tool that allows you to edit genes here
*  It is clustered regular regularly interspaced
*  short
*  Dramac repeats that's CRISPR. That's what it stands for. It's a family of DNA sequences found in the genomes of
*  Prokaryote prokaryote organisms just as bacteria and
*  Archie archae archae archaea
*  These sequences are derived from DNA fragments of bacterial fog
*  This is a terrible paragraph
*  How do you say that bacteria figs
*  bacteria
*  Bacteria age ages pages that had previously infected the prok prokaryote. Oh boy
*  Ah, so I know exactly what you're talking about
*  Let me try
*  So this gene editing tool whatever the fuck that means. What the fuck? What is this tool?
*  They can edit genes and they're in the process with a computer. It'll show you right how they do it there
*  It's like I don't understand the process but I know that they have a process I don't know what it's saying
*  Is this in a computer read that what is that saying the cas9 protein forms a complex?
*  Forms a complex with the guide RNA in a cell the complex attaches to a matching
*  genomic
*  DNA sequence adjacent to a spacer yellow segment the cat. Yeah, what am I saying?
*  Okay, that's the yellow segment you saying I do but you don't say and like I'm reading this and I don't know what the fuck
*  I'm saying. Well, that's right. It's too complicated for more unlike me. It's too complicated
*  I want to know what the tool is. Is it like a wrench or is it like a fucking computer?
*  I don't know what the fuck it is. It's probably a computer. Oh, it's a fork
*  That's the dude right guy
*  It's just a robot hand
*  It's a dude with tweezers in a fucking hot dog. It leaves a lot of room for error
*  I just I wonder like what other countries are doing what kind of crazy shit they're trying if they're they're trying to create new humans superhumans
*  They're gonna do it. Someone's gonna do it if they're it's gonna be us or it's gonna be them
*  Someone is gonna create superhumans. I'm not saying it's a good idea. I'm just looking at the the laws of improvement
*  I don't think that's a real thing
*  But if it was the law of improvement would state that if something's possible
*  Something's possible someone's gonna make it happen when we we detonated two nuclear bombs
*  We could have just one was we everybody got the point, right? Yeah, why they do it twice?
*  But it's a display I suppose right well someone could do that with super people
*  Yeah, like that could happen it could happen quick. He should be a UFC fighter. Well, they might be the new aliens
*  When you get to UFC fighters
*  Might be a new species if someone could really get a hold of a crisper and create like a Thor
*  Create like a like a legitimate superhuman person and you could just develop a whole race of those
*  It would just be like instant game over people aren't people anymore. How long does that take?
*  I don't know how long we take do they have to grow from baby to my man. These are freak. I don't think so
*  That's the thing and you know, they just come out like I think they just or some Lord of the Rings
*  They come out like orcs and Lord of the Rings where they just cut the puss and then
*  The fucking they come piling out of them and he's just like I'm gonna kill fucking
*  Is that how the orcs were born? Yeah, you never seen a Saruman and yeah in the pit of Helms deep
*  Those are great fucking movies man incredible those orcs were the scariest shit ever also if you watch three if you watch three
*  It's 12 hours. You could take a half a day watching Lord of the Rings
*  It's the best. Yeah those Lord of the Rings movies man. Come on
*  Those orcs knows goblins. They were the scariest fucking the goblins were scary. Oh you ever heard a necro goblicon
*  No, it's like a metal band, but the lead singer is a
*  Goblin
*  It's incredible can you pull up a picture of the lead singer of necro goblicon?
*  Hmm dude, this is that's them
*  Dude, it's fucking incredible
*  That's amazing. He reminds me of he reminds me of the goblin that tortures Frodo. Look at his face
*  Holy shit. Oh my god. That's amazing
*  Oh my god, that's amazing. This is hang on a second. Imagine. I like his friends. Hold on. Hold on a second back up a little bit
*  imagine if
*  That's really a goblin
*  You imagine if a goblin became a rock star and everybody thought it was cute
*  But it really was a fucking goblin you need to watch the video bro. The makeup's amazing. He never takes it off
*  And it's a real fucking goblin
*  Real
*  Goblin that's the whole deal like the his biggest song is like he has a normal job and he has a crush on this girl
*  No, my but she's in love with this like
*  douchebag
*  From the office. Oh my god. Is it below and powder on people? What is happening here?
*  I've never seen this video do just imagine if that was real
*  Imagine an alien comes down like with aliens goblins. They could be well, why do we think they're gonna look cute?
*  Why couldn't they be ugly looking aliens octopus looking monsters? They could be anything
*  Right. Yeah, that's a halo. You ever play Halo. I have you think about you know, Arbiter
*  What is Arbiter? He's one of the characters. Yeah, he's like
*  So they have fingers like this and that's why all their guns are like this, right?
*  Okay, but who's to say that
*  Aliens don't control their guns with like their booty hole or something weird
*  Why does it have to be with their hands aliens can control their guns with?
*  Whatever appendage they have good point
*  Aliens are weird
*  How how are they manipulating matter to make things right or do they even need to do they need to right?
*  Can they do things with their mind that we can't imagine?
*  Right
*  Yeah, is it possible though if you if it's possible to make noise and you can hear noise
*  What is that just some invisible shit flying through the air? I'm saying it to you
*  You understand what I'm saying just flies through the air and hits you
*  Why do we think that that's the only thing that's possible?
*  There could be some really weird abilities that things have to manipulate matter that maybe evolve over hundreds of thousands of years
*  We all got a booty hole gun. Yeah
*  Who knows who knows
*  I'm gonna hit you with my fucking booty hole gun and destroy a fucking block
*  Maybe it's like super normal for aliens like peeing each other the way dogs do
*  You know, maybe I'll just walk up just piss on each other all the time
*  Who knows who fucking knows who knows but you know, all we can do is just sit and drink beer until until
*  That's it
*  I'm amazed that they if they really did have UFOs this whole time that they kept it such a good secret
*  pretty incredible
*  Like I don't want to encourage that kind of behavior
*  But I gotta say I'm impressed right if the government really kept their fucking mouth shut for that long
*  Like no one government is not
*  These are like those old school Vietnam vets with fucking craggy skin and tough guy voices. Those are the ones that are still left
*  Millennials they take those positions. We're gonna have a real hard time keeping secrets
*  It's not gonna be the same
*  It's not no, I mean you they're not gonna keep any secrets
*  How do you feel about the Battle of Los Angeles?
*  the Battle of Los Angeles, we're
*  wherever there there was pictures in the paper and
*  Shit, and it's just spotlights and we were shooting at this thing. Oh, right. Was that like over that?
*  Old yeah real old like the 50s or something. Yeah. Yeah
*  Who the fuck knows what that was man? What the fuck is that and then we shot at it and it wouldn't go down and
*  Because they see that who knows you got it's either two things. It's either they know and
*  They're hiding it or it's something
*  earthly terrestrial, yeah, and
*  People just interpret it as
*  Yeah, look at this searchlights and anti-ancraff guns
*  Comb sky during a lot what years that Jim
*  1942 so what year did Oppenheimer first detonate the bomb?
*  I know the Manhattan Project was already in operation by 42, but had they detonate the first bomb yet?
*  Tests of the actual the actual first test
*  Let me check I bet it was around that time a couple years later
*  Maybe I bet in that in that time period when human beings start in a race to try to split the atom
*  That's what I bet the aliens like hey, hey, hey, we got a live one. Yeah, we got a live one over here
*  Figured it out. Yeah the 1940s. They were all doing that shit, right?
*  Three years later. Yeah, so they were probably working on it back then and the aliens are probably well aware that there was a race going on
*  And they probably visited that's what I would do if I had like
*  like a planet like imagine if you're a
*  Researcher and you have a whole planet and on this planet
*  They've lived for millions and millions of years, but the most advanced things like a monkey person
*  You know like an australia pithicus or something and they go listen. We know where this is going
*  It's gonna take a long time. They might not even make it
*  They might get wiped out by a volcano
*  Just fucking sprinkle a little bit of us and them get that crisper working
*  Manipulate the DNA with the wrench or the little tongs with the hot dog the hot dog dogs
*  Splice it in and make some new people what happened to dinosaurs Joe?
*  asteroid
*  Yeah, they hit the Yucatan. They know when they know where there's there's something called. I think it's called iridium
*  it's really rare on earth and really common in space and
*  There's a thick layer of it around 65 million years ago, and it's just giant crater in the Yucatan
*  That's what killed all the dinosaurs for sure likely most likely
*  There's some other theories about how long they lasted which ones died off which one like like
*  Alligators are here right now, right?
*  Bro one ate a kid at Disneyland a couple years back. No shit. It was the year before I was there
*  Disney world not Disneyland Disney worlds the Florida one a kid
*  Yeah, a two-year-old kid snatched him up Jesus horrible horrible playing near the water in this fucking dinosaur
*  And imagine you take your kid at Disney World. Well, it's gonna be safe for sure. We're at Disney World
*  Yeah, they've done a great job making sure there's not monsters live in your pond. Yeah. Nope. No, there's monsters in that pond
*  Fucking alligator came out and ate their kid. Look at this motherfucker. That's a motherfucker
*  This is a different one
*  This is like they have video of this bro
*  These people are standing just a few feet away from a goddamn
*  Dinosaur with a brain the size of a quarter
*  I think doesn't give a fuck about you or your babies or your kids or you're just lucky
*  You're lucky that dinosaur doesn't just the size of a human. Yeah, it's so they're so big and that's not even a huge one
*  There's there's a video one in Florida walking across a golf court
*  It's 15 feet long and you see it and these guys are in awe. They're like, what the fuck they're out there playing golf and a
*  legitimate dinosaur walks by
*  15 foot long alligator. It's so big. It's so big dude. It's like look at it. Look at that thing
*  Look at that. Yes. Holy Christ. Holy Christ. Look how big that is on the golf course, bro
*  Look how big look at the size
*  Yeah, holy shit man your ball struck my foot, holy fuck that thing's so big
*  What I'll see you in the parking lot
*  What's the Billy Madison quote?
*  Or happy Gilmore. That's what it is. Oh the alligator ate his hand
*  Carl Weathers, it's fucking crazy. How crazy is that? You're out there living in Florida. You live with that's a dinosaur
*  That's a real legit dinosaur you think about it too. It's so interesting to think about
*  like even in Florida, but in Australia
*  the spiders
*  The house spiders like I see a spider. He's like this big I'm like, okay fine
*  In Australia the average spiders like this fucking big yeah, what are you gonna do terrifying creatures over there?
*  There's brown snakes and shit
*  My Australian friend Adam Green tree is always trying to get me to go out there go camping with him like get the fuck out
*  Of here. No
*  No
*  No, so much protein if yeah, you're hungry. Is that a huntsman? Yeah, Jesus Christ. Look at that thing
*  That's so big Australia's just buck wild man
*  There's it's so bizarre to think like all and you've seen the there's big-ass grasshoppers
*  That are like this big
*  Locusts man
*  Terrifying, you know, I didn't find out until a few years ago. Yeah, look at that fucker. What is that?
*  He's eating a full carrot like a infant like a toddler. He's eating a carrot like a fucking toddler
*  That's insane. It's like he's screaming through a traffic cone. Also if I saw a centipede I would die
*  Oh my god, look at the size of that
*  Look at that butterfly thing
*  Moth moths like the ugly butterflies true. It's really the same thing
*  How come why is that pretty and why is that fucking swat every chance?
*  I did what cuz we value beauty look at that
*  Look at that creepy if I saw that I would run away bro. You ever seen a centipede eat a mouse
*  No, do you want to it's probably see find the centipede eats a mouse. I didn't know they did this man. I
*  I never would have thought that thing was a monster. I thought it's just a bug
*  It's little bugs. Uh-uh. No eats a bow. You just saw a grasshopper eat a carrot like a fucking four-year-old
*  It's crazy. That's a four pound grasshopper
*  Look at this. Look at this centipede attacking his mouth. Oh shit, bro
*  They're predatory like alien like a movie. That's like the movie alien. Holy shit. It's biting into the back
*  And killing it dude, it's more than sad that's an alien
*  Into the body, oh my god take that off of the camera bro. Imagine holy shit. That's why you need to learn jujitsu
*  For a centipede nice need to learn jujitsu. You need to figure out how to well, that's your next Avenger
*  Nice jujitsu class. Don't let them get your back, but that's not good
*  You're back my cats killed two mice in my house. Your cats are murderers. Every cat's a murderer
*  There's no doubt about that
*  But if if the mice knew jujitsu, maybe my cat would have died cat is so big cat is big
*  They don't have a chance but the centipede is not that much bigger than the mouse or it's smaller than the mouse really cat is big
*  Mice is small. Well, we got to worry about his bugs because bugs are small, but that's what nature did to them
*  They made them like
*  Invulnerable but small so we could squash them. But if they were big we'd be so fucked those murder hornets
*  Remember they were trying to scare us with those
*  That was right during the kovat, you know, you saw Tiger King and then murder haunted
*  Then the honeybee figured out how to vibrate yeah all around it and kill it with heat isn't that crazy
*  That's crazy. It's crazy. How did they figure that out?
*  And how do they know how to work together to overheat the the well, Utah is the hive state murder wasp
*  Utah's the hive state. So bees are smart as shit. Yeah, they're weirdly smart weirdly smart
*  there's something connected to bees and
*  Aliens well for sure they all know how to make that fucking hive. There's no classes
*  Come on man, imagine all over the world this one being knows exactly the kind of shape to make and makes it with like
*  What's it using? How did what creates that wax?
*  It's like using what they get
*  It's using what they get from plants, right?
*  Is it pollen that makes the stuff that they use for wax?
*  Is that what they get or is it an excretion from their own?
*  Excretion so they eat then they make this excretion and then they they literally build a house with their own spit and then we eat it
*  Yeah, it's delicious
*  Honeycomb. It's very good
*  Never had it. I'm not a big honey guy. No
*  Are you into sweetened though?
*  No
*  You you an aspartame or real sugar guy. I
*  Like the coke with real sugar. You know sugar cokes the best. That's true
*  And there's an added benefit of knowing it's killing your body
*  The diet coke you can pretend you're healthy. I'm having a diet coke. This is basically like a max
*  That is not water bitch. It doesn't there's nothing about that. That's water. This is water for me
*  You know
*  What do you say why don't you crack that one open?
*  Let's really get into it. Let's get down to the real nitty-gritty
*  We're with aliens making we're talking about eating
*  Yes
*  Yeah, you know, that's the crazy thing is we need bees to make other plants
*  Like can you find out about pollination? You're like what like that's how it's done
*  It's done through the bee the bee gets it on their body and then they go to another plant and it pollinates in that's bananas
*  What a stupid system and what we need there is a
*  Major rookie. Oh, yeah for sure. There's one boss
*  Yep, Queen bitch
*  That's crazy
*  It's just like humans essentially. Yeah. Well in a way
*  Well, it's not though. It's like some it's here's like this is the thing about bees. They're small
*  So we love them
*  But if they were big they would be our biggest enemy ever
*  that would be the most terrifying thing on the planet is a horse sized bee and
*  Then imagine like enormous
*  huge
*  colonies of horse sized bees that come out of the mountains like demons just
*  Come in
*  Yeah, do what those Japanese hornets do where they cut those beehives head those honeybees heads off
*  Imagine there's something out there doing that. There's bees cutting other bees heads off. Oh, yeah
*  That's what these murder hornets do they they climb on top of the back of the honeybee and they bite their head off
*  Yeah, but then honeybee strength in numbers
*  That's the strength and I got my guess what they don't always win. It doesn't always work out sometimes
*  There's a terrifying one that if it was a horror movie like if you were a honeybee
*  It would be the worst like Conan the barbarian movie ever. Yeah, but most brutal
*  swarm in and these murder hornets grab a hold these honeybees and just chop their heads off and
*  They're trying to get in I think to get to the I think they want
*  Do they what do they want the eggs? This looks like what are they trying to get to video bro? It's what's that?
*  But look how they do it they cut their fucking heads off man, it's horrific
*  There's so much bigger and they just run up on these honeybees and cut their heads off
*  How do they cut them off with those clippers incisors? Yeah, see those front clippers those lateral
*  Grab them and chop them up man. It's horrific
*  They just tear them apart with their face
*  So this is there's these weird look those are all dead honeybees and these these weird wars that go on with these
*  Murder hornets and honeybees
*  Do you know what's gonna happen like
*  They totally set those fucking dude, it looks like a fucking Tony Hawk skate video
*  It's this looks like a very 90s video Jamie. That's a really good question
*  I do you think this is like a murder for hire scene they need
*  It's a snuff film
*  Let the bees or let the horns go and they need a fish eye they need a fish eye lens
*  Look at what's going on here. You got these hornets and you have murdered by this is a horror movie for bees
*  Like look around back there. Those are all bee bodies
*  good transition there cut these I mean
*  If that's what we're why like maybe they did what this up maybe they brought in murder hornets to an active honeybee
*  I know bodies had no list bodies the comb. Oh the comb. Yeah, I know how they figured that out
*  It's perfect. It's always like that too. It's not like one guy. They're like, bro. I'm gonna have a fucking double
*  Yeah, no one has cones like you know, like some wheels on cars that are just so big there's no cone like that
*  They're all the same
*  Yeah, I don't know how to do it all over the world too, it's a weird animal
*  We're just lucky that little thing is that that size that fucker was big German Shepherd size bees
*  Let's go back. Let's go back to the monolithic period. There were probably bees fucking a foot long. Let's find out
*  What was the biggest bee in history? You say a foot long? I say you're probably right. I say foot long
*  I agree with you. I bet you that dinosaur time. Yes fuckers. We're not that big. That makes sense. Maybe even bigger
*  I'm gonna go foot in a half. Fuck it. I'll go foot in a half
*  What do you think Jamie?
*  First result was not correct. It gave me something that was actually alive recently. They thought was extinct. So that's not oh
*  But let's take a guess now while we're I'd say 11 inches. I say a foot and a half. What do you say?
*  That's not so big. I know there
*  Shoe flying around
*  Yes, 17 inches is pretty big
*  18 inches five six inches. That's pretty big. Yeah
*  Inch and a half. I say 11 is totally possible though. There was giant fucking bugs back then 18 inches ain't shit. I
*  Would imagine there was a big shacks
*  Keeps giving me this thing called Wallace's giant bee which was mmm two and a half inches
*  Oh my god, and two and a half any shit. I know what do you think? Let's let's go
*  What do you think that dog was like fucking 30 feet long
*  That's a tarantula hawk that's on in front of the skull see that little glass bottle. Oh, can I yes?
*  Yeah, that's from Maynard, you know Maynard from tool man. Can he has these that's him's his from his farm
*  He's that's this is him. That's his it's him
*  That's he's haunting this room through that bug that's from his farm he you know he runs his vineyards and
*  He he sees these fuckers up there. Yeah, if this if we think about history is exponential
*  Then these fuckers had to be 11 inches exactly
*  Science well, okay, let's let's ask this. What do you think the biggest bug ever is?
*  What's the biggest bug ever?
*  In
*  History make sure make sure it's like not his bug in his like millions of years. I say two feet, okay
*  All right, um I
*  Want to say bigger
*  Really? Yeah, I want to think there's like some fucking serapods. They're technically bugs
*  Is that what they're called serapods serapods some of those?
*  cephalopods
*  Maybe and then crazy. Oh, yeah those fuckers that are like like a Pokemon. Yeah, it's a kabutops
*  If there was some creepy old bugs back in the day for sure. Yeah, I
*  Want to say it might be three feet you could probably like it's different
*  So I guess I'm like a lobster and crabs are technically
*  That's what the divers call and they call them bug there are bigger ones of those than this largest dragonfly
*  It's showing me. There's like 1.8 meters. I feel like there's gotta be a crab or what's a conversion
*  What's one feet and then 0.8?
*  Is like compared to a six foot person. It's not that big
*  It's pretty big
*  If that was trying to climb in your asshole you'd be very unhappy that's big
*  But yeah, but compared to a person so then they say that's the largest instinct insect ever extinct insect
*  275 million years ago. Oh not that impressive so
*  There's a parameter and what an insect is and we could yeah, no not even a large
*  That's like a large hot dog, that's what it's like I have largest bug ever in history
*  We're lucky they're little I just found out a few years ago that
*  when when
*  Locusts come and they swarm into like like an area and ruin cornfields and chilling those are grasshoppers
*  Some weird change happens to grasshoppers, and they become locusts, and it doesn't happen all the time. There's like some possessed
*  Maybe we're like
*  You know we're trying to like write it down as some sort of technical
*  Hormonal change inside the animal, but maybe that is every now and then they get possessed by demons
*  And we're just trying to figure it out
*  What makes harmless little green grasshoppers turn it into brown crop chomping clouds of swarming locusts serotonin?
*  Oh shit. Yep according to study published this week in science
*  It took just two to three hours for timid grasshoppers in a lab to morph into a gregarious
*  Locusts into gregarious locusts after they were injected with serotonin Wow Wow
*  So they it changes this chemical changes what they are and they get bigger. I think right don't they get bigger
*  They look bigger. Well you saw
*  grasshopper eat a carrot
*  So they get up there that was a ridiculous grasshopper like if you were on your bike
*  And your face hit that grasshopper like you'd be fucking you might get knocked off the bike right
*  Like a baseball well, that's a bird
*  You hit a bird
*  Like if you hit a bird with your face while you're driving your bike like you're probably gonna fall down
*  You probably you take might might be able to take it if you get the wiggle of the bike
*  Keep your wits about you you get hit in the face with a bird
*  I mean planes go down
*  Right they do birds get sucked into the fucking engine one bird. I think it's more than one bird
*  You need a few birds. Yeah, I think you need a lot of beaks
*  I
*  Think grinds up quick beaks or keto. Yeah, the meat grinds up quick. I think it's the beaks
*  the beaks of the issue
*  Was my mind to Rolls Royce makes turbines
*  Yeah for jet engines. That's the craziest shit. They make dope stuff man
*  That's a weird company right? It's pretty ball on a let everybody know you're not fucking around
*  I have a Rolls Royce
*  Derby my airplane I
*  Don't you know this I was just playing a character driver Rolls Royce
*  What I yeah, yeah
*  You have one beautiful, what does it feel like when you drive around that thing like a boat?
*  Mmm. It's like you're on a pontoon
*  But you're also on a
*  you're on like
*  There's if you wanted to go to the king of the the custom car like the king of the
*  Expensive luxury car it's Rolls Royce. That's the king. Yeah, there's something about it driving around you got that grill
*  Come on son. You got stars in the roof ladies love ours on the roof. That's right stars on the roof
*  You gotta do that in the Bronco
*  No
*  72 Bronco you're not allowed to do that. That's gross
*  He can't you can't put that blue light inside the wheel well. Ah stop doing that stop doing that
*  Listen man. I got blue light in my wheel well. You can have that if you like
*  You're a different person a lot of people should not put blue light in the wheel well of their classic Bronco
*  But yours is from the OJ days. Yeah, right. That's okay. You can do whatever you want to those
*  I'm happy to see that here because there's a certain charm about Broncos that I think a lot of people
*  Understand they make you smile. I see a nice Bronco makes me smile. There's something about it even the new ones
*  I love it look at that. That's my Explorer. That's a 92 Ford Explorer ladies and gentlemen
*  You got a 92 Ford Explorer with those kind of crazy going doors. Yeah, the back ones don't work
*  They're hard to it's hard to get in
*  But it looks cool. I think the person who did those wing doors the best is Tesla that Tesla X
*  Yeah, the goal wings are gangster. It goes straight up in the air, and then it comes straight down
*  I mean those things are sick
*  And I like Christmas mode
*  What's Christmas mode? I've seen the dance mode. Yeah, that's a party what I?
*  Maybe you just do dance mode during December, and then it's Christmas
*  Tiffany Hattish
*  Back in the days we were allowed to go to the Comedy Store
*  Tiffany Hattish was in the parking lot and she had her car on dance mode
*  She had it playing music and the car was dancing
*  She was dancing in front of it and a bunch of us were dancing too. It was hilarious
*  It's like a car dancing car and what were your moves like my dance moves. Yeah, they were very subtle
*  Very like barely moving
*  Yeah, look at that. Yes. Yeah, that's the Christmas
*  It also plays Trans-Siberian Orchestra
*  This is what happens when you get super smart dudes, and you give them too much free time
*  You're like what else you guys want to do and they're like Elon what we want to do is you want to make it dance
*  Like okay, that's for Christmas super cool. We want to make it dance for Christmas Halloween every
*  Holiday yeah
*  That's a different animal too like the Tesla animal
*  When you're in one of those it doesn't even feel like a car it feels like you're on you're on some next-level thing
*  You're in some oh, this is what the future of cars is. Oh, it's here right now. Would you drive a entirely?
*  autonomous car I
*  Think you're gonna have to eventually I don't think so
*  I think they're gonna get so good at making those things not crash that will completely eliminate auto accidents
*  I think then there's something there's
*  Something that
*  Could have you seen upgrade
*  Yes, I did fun movie and then great movie. Yeah car gets hacked
*  Yes, that's right. That's right right
*  I think always and I can't speak for the next generation, but I think I will always until I die
*  Drive my motor vehicle I
*  Think that we're old-school
*  I
*  Think that we're old-school. Yeah
*  Because think of you're younger than me, but you will be people younger than you and 10 20 years from now
*  They'll be different dealing with a totally different reality like there's a lot of kids today. They're just used to uber right?
*  That's what they do
*  They just use Lyft or they use uber and they barely drive anywhere avoids drunk driving doesn't cause that much
*  They just travel around with other driving them. They're used to someone else driving
*  All the sudden it comes along that you can get a car that can drive you around and with a hundred percent certainty not crash
*  Into other cars right but did they all communicate with each other right they're gonna say hey people we
*  How many people die from car accidents every year right now think about what?
*  What we would do to bring those people back all you have to do is not drive your car, and that's how it happens
*  It doesn't happen because anybody's evil doesn't have it just like this is what people do they get more and more control
*  Over their environment and more and more control over safety and more and more control over what you can and can't do right?
*  You don't want to violate the safety protocols if everybody else is using the autonomous car
*  And you're in your crazy Bronco, and you smash into someone that's your fault
*  You fucked up if you didn't have that that's how I like a Bronco post Malone
*  It's just like it's just like an airplane flight if I'm gonna die on an airplane
*  I would rather know that I'm gonna die rather than
*  Completely out of control I wonder what the situation if you were asleep
*  Probably they never want you up you took two
*  Two of those ambience and just fucking
*  crashed
*  I'm just gonna lay here got a couple
*  Oxygen masks are falling down from the ceiling
*  Stop I hate flying
*  But then you just wake up but think about it if you knew how to fly a plane yeah
*  Everything would be different the sure if you knew how to fly an airplane
*  Yeah, the anxiety of flying would be gone. I don't think that's true because you know you understand that turbulence is
*  Controllable and
*  You can figure it out. Yeah, but I think when shit goes wrong it goes really wrong
*  Yeah, it's always gonna be there right there's always gonna be that fear, but then as a passing as a passenger
*  Yeah
*  It's kind of like being with a crazy driver. You're like oh, he's making me nervous
*  Yeah, a little bit could be but then I mean turbulence is uncontrollable
*  but
*  You feel more comfortable having known if
*  This crazy driver goes crazy you can grab the wheel and know how to drive mmm fuck
*  Imagine that scenario drinking champagne
*  Hang with your buddies on a plane thinking everything's groovy all sudden pilot has a stroke and
*  Then fuck oh shit posty knows how to fly a plane
*  He's gonna save the day
*  What if they both get sick with some crazy disease you only stopped in Hawaii for one night
*  But something that the fucking pilots ate they're sick with a contagious disease, and they're in the front so they're zombies
*  Dude the pilots are zombies
*  Yeah, we just made a fucking dope ass movie right now
*  Isn't it Chuck Palin duck doesn't he have us a movie or a book?
*  He has a short story where a person turns into a werewolf on a plane
*  Somebody somebody sent it to me along
*  That sounds awesome. Yeah, I think it's a little girl a little girl becomes a werewolf on a plane called survivor
*  Sorry, it's a kid becomes a werewolf on a plane Google that
*  What is that he had a collection of he had a collection of horror stories didn't he okay?
*  That's called haunted haunted. Yeah, that's Chuck Palin. Look right am I saying his name, right?
*  Thank you see
*  Yeah, that's it. That's it and one of them is about
*  Am I remembering this seems super obscure it popped up when I was looking through here
*  This is the same guy wrote fight club really had him on the podcast for a very interesting guy
*  super smart
*  but
*  What a fucking imagination so
*  That's a great movie of creepy thoughts right yeah pilots. Yeah pilots get
*  The zombie disease before taking off and then the pilots become
*  zombies on the flight
*  There it is a 13 year old Chihuahua Indian girl transformed as if as if a werewolf
*  Aboard the plane and caused the crash she relates her theory to
*  Missing link who tells her the girl in question was his sister. Okay. I think I just gave away some spoilers
*  What do you do with Kevin Spacey what happens with that guy now? I have no idea that's he's the guy he's Kaiser isn't he
*  Wasn't he the guy in that movie?
*  That was Brad Pitt. I was doing Brad Pitt
*  Yeah, I
*  Was doing Brad Pitt I know but I was saying he's saying it to Kevin Spacey then he kills Kevin Spacey right
*  I'm 25. Hey, bro
*  That's one of the best answers
*  Ever given to anything one of the most self-aware answers anybody's ever given to anything
*  How about this first great fucking movie man seven Jesus Christ that was a vivid movie
*  large torso
*  Kevin Spacey
*  Okay
*  There it is it's not the smallest torso. I'm not mean you're jealous
*  A little bit jealous you know your torso's
*  It seems he's got a good good lung capacity
*  Take a big deep breath
*  What's in the box
*  It's a creepy ass fucking movie man, I love a good creepy movie
*  You do but for me detective was kind of like seven for me the first season. Yes
*  I like them supernatural
*  I like creepy movie super supernatural or with monsters because I know they're bullshit that way like ones that are like too close to humans
*  To actual human I like that I like I like kind of like the slasher type vibe to where it's like
*  Oh, there's a dude in a mask that wants to fuck everybody up
*  I love because I know if it was my house. I just pop the fucker and then burn it
*  I don't think that works with Jason it works with Jason, but he always comes back
*  He made like a hundred movies. Well. What was the last movie the last movie was Jamie Lee Curtis?
*  She's still fucking with this dude. It's oh
*  That's a different one
*  Yeah, and then Michael my yeah Halloween. That's right and my dad
*  My dad used to scare the fuck out of me, and he knew
*  Michael Myers scared the shit out of me and for Halloween he put the mask on and scared the living shit out of me
*  That's a terrible thing to do to a kid
*  That's why I'm so fucked up to Michael
*  Michael Myers is Halloween and Jason is which one had more movies
*  We were a few right Jason Voorhees right here the most there's like fucking eight of those
*  Nine
*  He linked up you do you remember leprechaun yes
*  Yes, I do leprechaun killed Jason oh my god that got to a point where Freddy Krueger was fighting Jason
*  And the only motherfucker that could kill Jason was fucking Freddy Krueger
*  Oh
*  My god, it's so stupid look at
*  Leprechaun
*  Yo, there is a leprechaun versus Jason there really is I might have edited this cleverly or no I remember this this was an actual movie
*  Are you sure I remember leprechaun in space?
*  I did and I just clicked on the first that pops up leprechaun versus Jason was a movie
*  I think people are edited some shit. Why don't you Google it?
*  Jesus Christ I did and all that comes up is YouTube clips. I don't think that's a real movie. Mmm. What about that?
*  Look a fan played I made for fan made trailer
*  See it. Yo people ask for is Jason stronger than Freddy
*  But which Jason is the scariest
*  Jason and leprechaun how does someone not make that movie? There's guys. Yeah, can we look at a deal?
*  Can we look up leprechaun Jason fanfiction bro before?
*  Some fanfic of leprechaun and Jason a hundred percent there after but before kovat
*  You could probably walk into any like any of those horror movie making
*  Producers office and pitch that idea and they'd be like, oh shit
*  Why didn't we think of that leprechaun versus Jason in space in space?
*  in Yellowstone and Michael Michael Myers is a director
*  How many movies were there with Jason it has to be like 20, right?
*  It's like more okay, let's ask this more Jason's or more mission impossibles more Jason really for sure
*  It's a lot of mission impossible. This is like five, right? I don't know. I was trying to find the newest one the other day
*  I was trying to watch something crazy and mindless
*  There's a lot of born identities
*  Yeah, oh my god, their prophecy will be committed concluded on the 13th
*  Yeah, exactly. They're waiting for that and ten. No, they're waiting for leprechaun
*  That's it. This is the trailer for the fucking movie Jamie
*  This is a trailer you saying that us looking everybody laughing
*  And the leprechaun together at last
*  Why don't you get killed by a leprechaun? He'd be like, I can't believe this shit
*  like if you're a girl you go home if you're a groupie and you go home with the the goblin or the
*  Necro gobble. Yeah, imagine even say he's a real goblin. Can't even say the word
*  necro gobble
*  Goblins hard to say it would be a great Stephen King book right there a goblin
*  Guy in makeup. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he still writes. Look at that leprechaun terrifying
*  Terrifying here's a great Stephen King movie about a vampire that flies around at night in his own plane
*  Great in terms of like let me just like stress. It's classic. It's like it's like a very 80s like
*  It's not great. Look you see it like man. This is like 80 yesterday not like, you know like a
*  You know like a classic
*  Francis Ford Coppola movie or Stanley Kubrick movie not like that, but
*  It's called Night Flyer. I think it's a really good book. I read the book. It's like a short story
*  I think and
*  Then the movie is this vampire just flying around fucking people up and then he he covers his plane during the day
*  He just lays out there and they have to figure out what the fuck's going on and this vampire with his own plane
*  Flying around fucking people up. It's pretty cool. I
*  Watched Salem's lot for the first time
*  That was a made-for-tv thing Sam's law. Yeah, no, it's like fucking nine hours long. Yeah. Yeah
*  It was like a made for like network television miniseries. Well, that was it too
*  It was made the first was it was a television. Yeah thing, right?
*  I think so that was the one with the guy from Rocky Horror Picture Show, right? Mm-hmm
*  Isn't Alice Cooper? No the
*  Who is Tim Curry? Tim Curry is the first it
*  He was the first it in the TV version of it, which is like believe it or not scary at the time
*  It's terrible. No that movie sucks. I hate it
*  Scares the fuck out of me still but they're nothing compared to the new ones the new it's that's the new yeah
*  That's I think this is it. I think this guy's scarier than the new guy. That's pretty scary
*  We all float down here cowboy look at that face man, Jesus Christ
*  So that's the 1990 Pennywise
*  Yeah, there's something about that that might actually be creepier. Yeah, it's just like
*  fucking
*  Lifeless well, there's something about it. It's a real
*  It's the thing about that is like if you looked into a sewer and you saw a man
*  Like that's a real thing. That's not like CGI. No, that's like yeah, there's no effects
*  Yeah, the thing about the new one is it scares the fuck out of you
*  But when it opens its mouth and clamps down bites a kid's arm off, right? You're like, that's not really happening
*  Yeah, do you know Michael Myers mess was will Shatner what really was a will Shatner mask? Yeah
*  No shit
*  It was yeah, there's a lot of information on it
*  But Michael Myers mass was like a will Shatner. Oh my god
*  It was supposed to be Captain Kirk apparently but oh my god. They just took the eyebrows off. It's fucking
*  terrifying
*  It oh my god, it is
*  That is who he is. How weird isn't that weird fucking real weird, but that's how fucking goes. It's like the uncanny valley
*  There's something about someone wearing a mask to like that kind of mask. Like you can't you don't see any humanity. Yeah, yes, it's just
*  I'm gonna fucking destroy you. Yes
*  from the darkness
*  That's what we're all scared of right? We're all scared of some super powerful demonic shit
*  It's outside of our control
*  Jason's coming demons are coming. What if demons existed but really rarely just like UFOs like these people that are taking selfies
*  At the Grand Canyon and they're like posing like look and then also
*  What if this little demon is just waiting for in the Grand Canyon?
*  Everywhere just everywhere just waiting for you to do something. There's just a couple there's like there's like 15 there it is night flyer
*  Yeah, look at that. That's the that's the vampire. That's that guy's the reporter
*  He's gonna expose the vampire
*  When I see when I say it's really good I don't mean it's really
*  I mean, it's really good because it's kind of schlocky and crazy and you're watching this fucking
*  No, it can't I like the vampire so much power he has to do with the vampire says
*  The book is cooler for sure
*  The book is really cool. There's another book that's really good. The Stephen King did about aliens called the Tommy knockers
*  That's a great book. That's about a UFO that was like buried in the in the ground near a town and its energy
*  Started fucking everybody up like it was it was messing with people and messing because there was this
*  This thing that was right and that was a great book that they made a movie out of it
*  But the movie didn't really kind of capture what the book was about
*  It's too hard it makes sense
*  Radiation I guess yeah, I'm not a doctor outer space craft fucking how do you react? How do you react to that?
*  You seem bright burn
*  Bright burn. What's that? So it's like
*  It's like Superman if he was bad Superman if he was bad if he was evil, okay, I
*  Thought it was great. It's a movie. Yeah, it's a movie
*  When did this come out?
*  Really?
*  God you should watch you should watch this loop. You should watch this fucker. It's pretty good. Yeah, dude. That sounds incredible
*  It's literally like parallel Superman it but if he was like bullied and treated like shit and he was angry. Whoa
*  Just imagine that oh my god
*  Imagine that if you had that power but you were angry instead of wanting to help people right like who says
*  Superheroes want to help people. Oh my god
*  Yeah, imagine if you're like super fucking annoying, but you're also super powerful
*  You're from another planet, but you smell weird and the girls here don't like you yeah fuck
*  And you're like god damn it and you just get angry and you become and you fucking you let them know squish your mom listen
*  School bus I'm more powerful than all you fucking ants this I always think about that too if there was a real superhero
*  Would he lay low or would he be like I am God?
*  He would I am
*  Beating girls off his dick 24 hours a day and you wouldn't have a chance to save the world
*  Cuz it would they'll be just lined up. There's a show called the boys
*  Right, they don't want that DNA. Oh, yeah, it's a like a superhero show. Yeah, but it's like
*  Superheroes are like celebrities
*  But it would be on such a more grand scale bro, but if you were the only one too, you would be
*  like
*  the the king of the planet well, that's that was always my problem with the watchmen not my problem, but like an
*  Interesting part of the watchmen story was dr. Manhattan, right who was basically a god, right? He could do anything, right?
*  There was no it seemed to be no limit to his powers. I mean he lived in space
*  He was wiener was huge huge giant blue hog and that was hanging around show hogs
*  You could show them in a movie, right?
*  I find a lot more hogs in movies nowadays. Well now they're desperate. It's like all they have a
*  Fucking hogs to show the hog. It was for a while. You could be cavalier about hiding your hogs
*  You
*  Didn't have to go to show in the hog in order to get ratings
*  But now goddamn it with Netflix they can do anything we got to show some hogs
*  We got hogs on Netflix
*  But in that movie was like remember when they had dr. Manhattan like you got out of the shower something like that
*  And you're like Jesus like you see his big old dick
*  Yeah
*  You what you had to do
*  So if you went to just to see a superhero movie and you're out where you girl
*  You're having some popcorn
*  Drinking some diet coke enjoying this movie all the sudden see I big old blue dick that you did not expect
*  But what about when he goes giant blue hog full-size like huge like in New York walking around
*  Yeah, yeah, well this giant blue dick just swinging. What does God's dick look like like that?
*  It's perfect. Not too big not too small. It's like the perfect tits aren't like triple-e fake boobs, right?
*  There's a there's a perfect time perfect dicks ridiculous like what is the number like a dude with a giant carpet-rolled dick?
*  That's no good like that's now you've got a handicap. There's a there's a comfortable
*  Time like whatever the size you gotta stop right there and don't be greedy. I'm happy here
*  normal good for you
*  No place to be man
*  What the dr. Manhattan dick yeah, you don't want any of that shit, but that dude was a that dude is a real god
*  Yeah, what's crazy is that could be people and that could be people in a hundred years with gene editing and technology
*  or crisper and then the ability to
*  incorporate
*  Technology inside of human beings when they figure out how to put processors inside of human beings and make you smarter
*  They figure out a way to connect your brain
*  Connect it through the air with the internet. You're always connected
*  That's the next move it's gonna happen that that's the next move is your wallets in your body
*  There was a video and I don't know if it was fake
*  Jamie there was a video where there was a corporation that was
*  they
*  Convinced their employees to get a microchip in their arm. Is that fake? That was real. No shit
*  Whoo, and they used it to like buy things at lunch and they could use it to open doors
*  Dude, they stuck this thing in their fucking arm
*  So they have like this RFID chip in their arms
*  Like if you want to work there you have to get it in your arm
*  I'm sounds like the Belko experiment
*  Just imagine that man you want to work at UPS great. We need to stick up fucking electronic
*  But that's what inside your body. I mean
*  97 percent of money is digital
*  Right like how much of his actual goal three percent look at that thing
*  They planted that in that dudes fucking hand. No, that would have been
*  Jiu-jitsu then what?
*  Huh?
*  That thing's gonna break you have to cut it out
*  It's gonna get infected
*  God damn it. No shit, bro
*  There's a fucking company and these people are lining up to get this shit injected into their body. Look at that guy
*  He's like I should have stayed in college. That's what he's thinking right now
*  He's thinking I should own this company for these guys are all assholes
*  I can't believe everyone's willing to get this thing in so many different ways
*  Get this thing inserted in their fucking body
*  Can't believe I couldn't ever
*  Crazy, I couldn't ever what is the the the company's name?
*  Three square excuse me three square market. I think I read about it once but like it's uh
*  They might have been doing like proof of concept to show this could work for other companies, which is that what they do
*  Do they do these things? So like you could
*  Uh almost like I think like those amazon go stores where you can just walk in grab what you want
*  And leave uh, uh this that your chip knows how much money you have and it just scans the scanner or whatever on the way out
*  What that's so what if you don't what if you don't have money?
*  No, then it follows you. What if you don't have money one of those iRobots?
*  Well, what if you build up that debt?
*  It's like 10 grand in chip net and then they gotta fucking take your fucking hand iRobot knocks on your door bang bang bang
*  Man, we are here to collect money from you post Malone. It's the suede denim secret police
*  Westworld
*  You watch that show. Yeah, I think that's first season artificial people you're allowed to shoot
*  Artificial pp people. Oh robot people you're allowed to shoot
*  Artificial people you're allowed to do that. I might have fucked that up. Well, I can't say necro goblin con
*  Who can
*  That would be a great stephen king book right a goblin that tricks people into thinking it's a man in a mask
*  How about a goblin with a microchip that runs out of money?
*  And then he has to go on the run from his fucking his debt collectors. Yeah
*  Right, that's a cool movie. Yeah, that's a cool
*  You get a little bit of lord of the rings you get a little bit of high rope you get all that shit
*  He has to tell people I keep my phone off most of the time because the debt collectors just blow my phone up
*  I only turn it on a couple minutes a day just to check my messages. Maybe maybe you think
*  The chip just goes crazy
*  And it gives you advantages of implants over cards is their permanence
*  They are unlikely to be lost and are non-transferable
*  Businesses do not need to worry about theft or access details to the same degree
*  Because to do so would involve
*  Mutilation and be much more obvious
*  what
*  What the fuck is that saying mutilation?
*  In the article someone that's incredible stealing your chip so they could cut it off your body
*  From a business perspective. It also allows a more precise tracking of employees
*  Due to the in-body nature of an implant over a car. Oh my god, so listen to this but this statement is so bizarre
*  mutilation in the article is businesses do not need to worry about theft or
*  Of access details to the same degree because to do so would involve mutilation
*  And be much more obvious
*  Imagine you don't have to worry about someone cutting that chip out of your fucking hip
*  And using it to open all the building and stealing all the information because that would be obvious
*  No, it'd be really obvious. Everyone would see it coming and it would involve mutilation
*  I love mutilation in the paragraph. That's my favorite you're sitting around at your house thinking
*  I can't believe I let these motherfuckers inject this thing in my hip
*  Just feeling it every morning you touch this thing. That's what I well that's what I was getting at
*  If you're overdue
*  On your balance it would just irritate you there would be something that would irritate you to the point of insanity
*  Wake up and get another job to pay me
*  What who are you fucking neurological and just like that? Yeah
*  The chip it's your chip. It's chip. Yeah
*  It's the overlord we are communicating to you from your chip
*  You don't want us to involve mutilation and this fucking is that would be obvious
*  It would be too obvious. It would be too obvious and involved. That's like the most
*  non-soothing
*  To sell that fucker it's not working
*  Way to say no one's gonna steal the chip
*  It would involve mutilation, holy fuck
*  imagine
*  No one mutilates. Don't worry. It's totally safe. No one's ever mutilated
*  It's not they don't even have a really good reason for you to do it course. They don't like to use copy machines open doors
*  How about I just press fucking copy how about I press start boss
*  You can't
*  Me bitch
*  What if that chip rots what happens if you play rugby and the chip breaks inside your arm says you can put it take it
*  Out just as easy as a splinter. That's a lie, but then it says
*  Chip is about this fucking big. That's the biggest splitter. I seen that's hilarious. Oh
*  My god, they would just have to bowie knife it out of you. Oh
*  That's how gotta be a fucking it probably is a dark mirror episode, right?
*  Is there one of those where someone gets a chip? I think every episode of black mirror. They have a chip
*  Yeah, they figured it out black mirrors figured out everything's gonna happen. Everything's gonna go wrong
*  You had the cloning thing earlier with that cloning episode that dude had remember where they had the space station team like oh yes
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes
*  Yes, that was the one where the guy was the tyrant right? Yeah fuck. That was a creepy one
*  that was a creepy one I
*  Like the video game one where he goes stays at that old mansion and he just goes fucking nuts
*  That's a good one
*  How long before they're gonna make an artificial post Malone looks just like you sits right next to you
*  Freaks you out is he doing my shows?
*  No, he's got no talent
*  He's a real easy robot. I think
*  There's gonna be it's gonna be a long road before they figure out a way to make an artificial thing that's creative
*  I think that might be the only thing we have well they try to make computers make music all the time. It sucks sucks
*  There's something that we do. We like we were talking about earlier it when you're doing something
*  We I mean humans that makes other people happy
*  That thing is hard to define
*  It's hard to figure out with numbers like you listen to eye of the tiger and you want to start running
*  Like what is that a computer fucking make that can't make a shot if you were a kid when I was in rocky 3 came
*  Out and that fucking song comes out. Holy shit
*  Yeah
*  Come on man
*  What are my chances of the artificial post he's sitting here while I take a take a piss I know I knew it was coming
*  Go go take a piss, bro
*  We have plenty of time. We'll be right back ladies and gentlemen and
*  This is super by Necro gobble con
*  We'll be right back
*  Yeah, disc problems are no joke man
*  That's a if you have like bulging discs or herniated discs you gotta take care of those
*  What you definitely can't do is fuck them up worse
*  Sure, like if you have a chance do something take they're real close to being able to fix that too. They're already replacing them
*  They're replacing them with these titanium discs that move around
*  They're not perfect, but it's better than you know having degenerative disc disease and have a massive pain all the time
*  And that's not something that I'm mad at
*  is
*  What I'm in it a disc I'm mad at chips in your hands that
*  You have to mutilate to get out. Yeah, that's scary
*  People totally a piece a piece of metal instead of a bone
*  Isn't harmful
*  No
*  But there's no technology in that it's just a filler right right?
*  It's just something to replace something that's broken right like if your hand gets bitten off by a shark
*  And they say listen you had two options right you're gonna have no hand
*  Or we'll make you a hand that looks exactly like your old hand Luke Skywalker style right you put that on you can feel with it
*  And everything which it won't be a real hand no
*  I mean, that's totally fine, too
*  If it's controlled by your brain
*  That could happen
*  That could happen come on man some Terminator shit. How strong would your goddamn hand be if it was made out of metal?
*  wires shit
*  Think do you think
*  You couldn't fight a robot no if you had a metal hand you can fight
*  No, they wouldn't let you
*  No, no chance. You can't have a metal thing. Don't be
*  Metal metal handed people or people too, and they would want to enter into MMA and fuck people up with their iron arms
*  Oh my god, that's that dudes. Oh shit
*  But he's got some I just was looking at this crazy hook thing also he makes a bunch of different that's cool is ever climbing
*  So he has different prosthetics that he does different things with
*  I met him he's got a carbon fiber articulating hand and a carbon fiber leg you got attacked by a shark is
*  Is the hand controllable? Yeah, he can move it like this with his nerves. I don't know how it's hooked up
*  Do you know how it's hooked up? No, I don't know if it's muscle
*  Maybe he tracks it with his muscles man. Oh, that's the whole thing that's like that's
*  Okay, yeah, I know we've done if somebody gets
*  It's like the self-driving car right right if there's a way for somebody to control that and
*  It's not just your nerves or whatever controlling right?
*  Instead of it's hooked up to the cloud or something somewhere like the fucking chip
*  You know what I mean? I do know what you mean look. I've never played an acoustic guitar right, but I would imagine
*  It's probably a pretty magical experience to play in like a really good guitar
*  It's very visceral and satisfying so that that
*  analog
*  Analog visceral satisfying feeling of doing something that there's that exists in the car world too if you look if you're driving like a
*  1969 Porsche 911 those air-cooled cars they weigh like 2,000 pounds and it's a
*  It's got this crazy right mechanical sound to it, bro
*  That there's a thing there's a connection you have to that that you're not gonna get once you start adding technology
*  That's gone that weird thing that that very analog thing you get from like
*  It exists with a lot of it exists with looking at a painting it exists with listen to someone saying it exists with with
*  jokes with there's a thing man when you can just fucking nail like a
*  Thing that makes you feel those cars make you feel better. That's the difference like an old
*  Car will make you feel better right that's a new car is not gonna do that a new car is gonna be cool as fucking awesome
*  Right, but it's not gonna make you feel better like there's something about
*  You feel better you're on a drug it's a very mild yeah amazing drug
*  You're not gonna get that off a spaceship. That's autonomous. It's you know it's autonomously driving
*  Yeah, and that's and that's the whole that's the whole deal. It's like
*  You know
*  There is technology that's helpful
*  Technology does not go
*  with
*  The human body yeah, it's this is like organic right you know what I mean yes and
*  Like the chip
*  It's it's gonna go wrong sometimes for sure it has to
*  It's not it's gonna be perfect all the people with the chip are 100% happy
*  Yeah, none of them got infection no mutilation was happy nobody there was no mutilation. It was never so obvious
*  that's what I'm saying like if you have to have a piece or a disk in your spine removed with a metal plate instead of a
*  metal plate with a
*  Micro chip in it. That's the total difference. You know what I mean. I do know what you mean
*  But what if that microchip made you feel better what they put that microchip in you and also
*  This is why I would want you to look at it
*  What it is is essentially new software management of your body your mind will stay the same post Malone right but your body
*  Will now be in control of this perfect system
*  That's gonna figure out what it means and what it doesn't need work at all now
*  You just live your life. You don't have to worry about your body anymore. I've already seen too many movies
*  I've already seen too many movies about don't worry about your not into it. It's fine
*  Everything's wonderful
*  It's okay. It is cool to be cyborg if you're living a shitty life. You're like I fucking hate delivering for postmates
*  I hate fucking where I sleep. I hate I hate what I do. I'm tired. I don't want to do it anymore
*  And then all sudden this this little thing comes along right give control of your body to the state
*  You still be the same inside your mind
*  But our microchip will control all of your biology to the point where you no longer need to go to the doctor
*  You don't need health insurance because you're never gonna get sick, right?
*  One but one by one people give in interesting we get infected interesting affected by technology interesting
*  Don't you think it's possible most definitely but is it better?
*  Here's the thing is it better if your grandma dies of cancer or is it better if you have some technology?
*  That keeps you from ever getting any disease ever, but it's embedded inside your body, and it's controlled
*  By a team of scientists, but it but it comes to I was watching something
*  The robot can walk and swim so it gets in your cells makes its way through to your brain and fucking explodes
*  Jihad, this is the craziest thing ever that what they're willing to do today with
*  with
*  Technology and you know like what they're experimenting on what we're seeing in these videos
*  It's just a tiny amount of what's possible for them in the future. I mean they could
*  Man we could have look insane technology of changing human bodies inside our lifetime
*  You're in shape
*  Right. I try my best mean not so much. Do you ever want to be no well there you go then yeah
*  I mean, I'm happy here as long as you're happy, but it like we were talking about earlier
*  It comes to I guess generation wise yes because
*  If you have to pantomime a cell phone
*  How do you do it you gotta do like this like this yeah flip phone, but I saw a video
*  Of are they doing this now. They're doing this okay that makes sense because the iPhone yeah, but we do it like this
*  Yeah
*  so
*  There there maybe later comes a time
*  Because like I said I will never drive a fully autonomous car
*  But I hear you I'm sure there's someone
*  Years down the line that will be like oh fuck. Yeah, are you kidding me I?
*  Think they're gonna do it because it's safer. I think that's why it's gonna be really hard to get people to
*  Sign off on the idea of letting people drive their own cars
*  It's the thing that we got really used to that we only got used to for a little while
*  I mean there was no cars in
*  1700 and in the 2020s everyone's got a fucking car there everywhere so in that time period
*  We went from all of human history no cars to the invention of a car whenever the fuck that was we figured that out once
*  1800s or something the 1800s they figured out the first car
*  That's not that long and then we just decide well you have to have a car basic human right
*  Don't really have to have a car, but cars are awesome like an old car is awesome
*  How are you gonna get to your job public transportation if it's better? That's what but that's a car
*  Well not necessarily it could be like a tube where people fly through it
*  It's all magnets on the other end to keep it from crashing into each other
*  They could figure out some weird shit that has nothing to do with cars
*  It's too late. It's not totally too late
*  I think if they could figure out a way to convince people that there will be no more auto accidents
*  That would be a good way to get people on board right they said no more auto accidents ever
*  People would probably be like oh well
*  How can you argue against that you selfish fuck you want to shift through your own gears and kill my Nana?
*  And that's that's what people are gonna do they're gonna give into it because they don't want to be selfish I
*  Mean this is like the slow slide into accepting that we're a part of technology right the slow slide is us hanging on to
*  Our biology as much as possible. I think that's a good thing. I think biology is awesome, but I see the writing on the wall
*  I see where it's going yeah, I mean it's going away
*  Yeah, we're sliding into this new existence, but we were real insistent on keeping our old ways
*  It's real weird. I know in terms of like I like to hear the rumble of an engine
*  I'm one of those people I love a rumble of an engine right
*  But then I mean I don't want to backtrack too much, but I have been
*  but
*  at the end of the day I
*  would rather
*  Be responsible for my decisions. I suppose yes. Well you're an artist you know you're
*  Just being an artist is a different kind of person
*  It's a person who's chosen a path of doing whatever the fuck they want to do like expressing themselves professionally of course
*  You don't want someone driving you feels good to drive. Hmm. Yeah
*  Experiences that you get in life you want to you want to feel them all you know some of them are dangerous
*  Some of them come with consequences if you make a mistake. That's how you get better if you take away all consequences
*  My concern is that we're gonna just like keep protecting ourselves more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
*  to it to the point where we're just
*  Incapable of withstanding any adversity. That's what I'm worried about with people
*  Well, and that's what I say I this is this is why I would rather
*  Drive my own car is because like
*  You never
*  Fully you never you wake up, and you never know what's happening right right?
*  You never know what's gonna happen during the day
*  There's something good about that yeah, no it's incredible, but we're all people and I
*  Would rather have that be biological than a
*  Computer yeah controlled and that's and that's where I'm coming from I suppose
*  I'm with you. I'm with you. I see both sides of it. I really do right
*  I'm not on a particular side of it right because I think I'm
*  What I think what all of us are doing is like witnessing these changes happening in real time and trying to hold on to whatever
*  Ground we have that we think is important and sacred. You know I think that's one of the things we're doing where
*  You know people that ride motorcycles they want to ride Harley's and loud engines, and it's romantic. It's exciting all those things
*  I think are cool, but I see the writing on the wall like a hundred years from now
*  It's all gonna be autonomous. Yeah, there's gonna be very few
*  Licenses that we give away to people to let them drive their own cars right it's probably
*  It's probably all gonna be controlled by some central system that keeps you at a certain pace
*  You know you cut it's it's gonna be annoying
*  It's gonna be annoying it's gonna be just drive to work no more fun anymore before it's like if you
*  Worked at a job, and you had a 68 Camaro right and you drove your 68 Camaro to work while you're driving down the street
*  Listening to white snake here. I go again on my own
*  And you're driving this fucking thing and you're shifting your own gear right that guy's having a good ass time and someone can come along
*  Take that away and say no no no you have to get in the autonomous tube now because safety safety is important
*  Says poor fucking dude who looked forward to his drive to work he had a 20-minute drive to work
*  But during that 20 minutes he listened to all the music he wanted to listen to he listened to whatever the fuck he wanted right
*  And then he pulled into that
*  Pulled him that fucking parking spot shut his car off right now
*  He's got to go to work, but he knows then in eight hours. He'll be free and fire that car up again
*  Right shift is on for drive home. Listen the best tunes call your friends
*  Right take that away from them you take that part away a
*  Person what about what about what about an attack?
*  an attack what kind of
*  like
*  Like you think about you think about no you think about you pull out your debit card right mm-hmm and
*  All of a sudden no one's debit card works. Oh, yeah, right. What's gonna stop that from happening?
*  What do you do with no money because
*  There's only 3% that's real cash. That's real
*  Like palpable so if everybody wanted all the paper for all the money they have in the bank
*  We would never be able to do it if if everybody's debit card stopped working
*  It would fucking much cash is there out there right I have no idea
*  But how much cash is there out there now in comparison like the 80s when there was only cash?
*  When there was only cash
*  It's probably the same amount
*  But most people use credit cards now, right like way more
*  Yeah, but think about if if we had an enemy that wanted to yeah say
*  No, or even or even our own government. That's just like
*  Mmm all technology monetary wise is
*  Cut off yeah, they just killed the system. They just stopped it all no more banks. No more banking no more ATMs
*  What are you gonna? You don't have any money? You know nobody has any money you can't buy food
*  You can't buy anything so you have to steal and then all your money everything up
*  How much you are currently?
*  trillion as of July 8th 2020 1.3 trillion look how much
*  How much is out there?
*  How do we differentiate what is
*  Like digital money right and what is actual money good point
*  There's 1.3 trillion accounted for but how much of it is an actual paper cash right yeah, yeah
*  And what is paper cash even worth?
*  depends on where you're at right
*  Some people don't even want it some restaurants like no we don't we don't take cash
*  Yeah, you do the yeah, it's a thing they flip it around
*  Says according to the CIA the total amount of
*  broad money is
*  80 trillion dollars whoa currently and cash was 1.2 trillion
*  So 1.9 trillion is actual cash and all the rest of it is just bullshit
*  It's fucking it's fucking nowhere
*  It doesn't exist. There's not a vault you can go in like a magic rich imagine
*  imagine
*  Where we were at war with the country?
*  And then they have the best oh
*  My hackers yeah, or whatever. I this is all hypothetical, bro
*  But you're you go to swipe your card and it doesn't work and then ever
*  But you're you go to swipe your card and it doesn't work and then everybody in America goes to swipe their card
*  And it doesn't doesn't work
*  And then you find out the goblin lead singer of that
*  And he's eating people the same way that centipede eats mice
*  No, it's horrible pretty brutal it is so brutal and that's what's normal that's normal out there
*  Just we've we figured out a way to wall it off
*  That's what it is all day long. It's things eating things right fucking chaos
*  Things eat things the ocean the ocean is one giant murder soup
*  That's all it is just monster murder soup a bunch of fucking things killing each other. How you feel about whales?
*  I love them. They're huge. I've been around them
*  Never seen one in my life. You should go to Hawaii. I think it's around I
*  Want to say it's around November ish find out when the whales go near
*  I've seen them near the Big Island on one of them cruises. They take you out
*  I've seen him a couple times accidentally while fishing
*  From Maui, but I've seen him on the Big Island when you go out on a boat ride humpback whale season on the Hawaiian Islands
*  Yeah between November and early May, but some months are better than others, so it's cool, man
*  So you're in this boat and then as you're out there
*  You just see one break the surface and then they you know lean towards that area
*  They go to and sometimes you see him swim under the boat. It's incredible. They're so big man
*  So they don't they're real biggest creatures on the planet. Yeah, yeah, currently other the biggest creatures blue whales are right under the biggest
*  Spur miles maybe blue whale biggest thing ever ever
*  Wow, they're so big dude, I mean we see that's a fucking dinosaur
*  How long have they been around like they didn't get killed by the Yucatan blast right aren't they something that's millions of years old
*  Maybe not that many million. Maybe that's what it is like we think about
*  Dolphins and how fucking intelligent they are how long have they been around
*  Here we go
*  173 tons oh my god. Oh my fucking
*  29.9 meters which is a hundred feet long. It's basically a hundred feet long and
*  weighed
*  173 tons known to have ever existed. Oh my god. It weighs an adult weighs
*  330,000 pounds and they live 90 fucking years. They live 90 years and they're smart
*  That's what's weird
*  We don't you know, they take care of the young
*  They're smart. There's some weird mammal
*  But then there's orcas which are their cut like orcas are their cousins to dolphins
*  That's the ones we love right we love killer whales, but they murder dolphins. They murder whales
*  They murder the murderers of the ocean. They're the killer whales. Yeah, but they call them killer whales and not a no whale
*  They're a dolphin. They call our dolphins. Yeah, they call them killer whales because they kill whales
*  So do they have rude sex for fun? I don't know if that's a good question cuz dolphins do dolphins do
*  That's a really good question. Let's find out
*  Yeah, do orcas have
*  recreational sex
*  Casual or sex you orcas have casual sex sex for fun. You probably get a better article
*  You get someone who's got a sense of humor
*  Do Google do orcas fuck for fun? You'll get the best article
*  I
*  Wonder how much they know about them, you know, I don't think they know about them the same way they know about dolphins
*  Is there is there because that there's not a lot of them. There's not as many as they used to be that's for sure
*  There's a real worry about the ones that are in the Pacific Northwest
*  There's a pod around the Seattle area. I think that
*  For whatever reason doesn't want to eat anything other than Chinook salmon
*  They get Chinook salmon and they're running out of salmon. There's not as many salmon anymore
*  So these things are starving and so they're trying to reintroduce like the idea of getting them to eat like seals
*  Shit sea lions things like that because other killer whales eat them all the time
*  So you have this native pod of killer whales that's really struggling and then you have these
*  Pods that are travelers they travel into the neighborhood. They just fuck everything up to eat all the seals
*  The whatever they want to eat mammals the fish the whatever they want and then they take off
*  So they're only there for a little while but there's one pod for whatever reason just wants salmon
*  How many is in the pot? Not that many they're having a hard time keeping them active
*  They're even thinking about releasing extra salmon into the water
*  They've had a bunch of like weird ideas of how to how to save them. How many
*  Jamie's Google
*  Animals that have sex not for fun reproduction. Yeah for sure chimps do but it says they also work
*  Masturbate which I found this
*  animals do too
*  They do stuff when reproduction isn't their only on a rock
*  Fuck a crab. They call it masturbation. It's crab rape
*  Jesus Christ. Oh my god
*  Imagine a killer whales horny just rubbing up against you you like just finish
*  Please a killer whale just go ahead
*  Don't get high with puffer fish right dolphins do don't they like pass them around and like yeah dolphins do
*  What the stories of killer whales rescuing people and they fall off boats, which is really crazy
*  Like they've got people they've actually said killer whales have actually helped them
*  It's weird because they kill people in captivity, but only because they're probably because they're tortured
*  You know, they're living in a fucking swimming pool a giant majestic
*  Yeah, ocean animal trapped in a prison for no reason didn't do anything wrong eventually start killing their trainers. They just get pissed off
*  Man man
*  Holy shit you guys are putting me on
*  You say they they they get high they use tough a toxic that fish fucking
*  Crazy, yeah, they take a little toot and they pass it around
*  The Dolphins expert deliberate handling of the terrorized puffer fish implies that this is not their first time at the
*  hallucinogenic rodeo
*  What if a human smoke? It's a volcano bag it is
*  What if a human smug puffer fish you probably dead in a second? What's it like?
*  I don't know, but we don't have a face like that. I would imagine a lot of shit a dolphin could do that. You can't
*  swim
*  It's got more poisonous Wow
*  1200 times more poisonous and cyanide enough toxin in one push puffer fish to kill 30 adult humans and there's no
*  No
*  Meanwhile only resulting in mutilation
*  I'm just here to get high I got this you pussies. Don't know what you're doing. How does that work? I don't know
*  I'd never knew that you know what's weird is that people want to eat them like they're like a prized sushi
*  Meat because it's like it's it's exciting you're eating something that the chef fucks this up
*  Dolphins or puffer fish puffer fish
*  Dolphin sushi is there I don't know there has to be so I don't like I like warm warm fish
*  Warm fish like cooked yeah baked yeah, I hear you. You're not a sushi guy. Yeah
*  Fugu that's it right there
*  No shit. Yeah, so that is a
*  It's it's a delicacy for whatever reason
*  People like the idea of eating something that might fucking kill them
*  And it has to be expert top ten most dangerous foods served in paper thin slices by expert chefs
*  The food who combines luxury with high stakes gamble the intestines ovaries and liver of fugu or blowfish contains a poison called
*  tech
*  tro
*  doc
*  Tetro necro gobble con
*  Ted Trow doxin
*  Tetro dough toxin sorry tetra dough toxin okay tetra dough toxin
*  Which is 1200 times deadlier than cyanide this toxin is so potent that a lethal dose dose is smaller than the head of a pin a
*  lethal dose
*  Smaller than the head of a pin and a single fish is enough poison to kill 30 people because of the high-risk
*  Chefs must undergo two to three years of training to obtain a fugu preparing license and such
*  Expertise raises the price of fugu dishes up to $200
*  What that's kind of cheap? It's really cheap. I think you might die
*  Yeah, they consume 10,000 tons of fugu fish every year. Oh my god. They're so ballsy. That's a warrior culture right there
*  fucking fugu fish
*  Okay, should we try no I'll try it bro. I don't want to be there when you die
*  I clicked one don't see what other foods were first right food they listed
*  hot dogs
*  Hot dogs are more dangerous than fugu fish people choke on them. Oh
*  My god
*  percent of food-related asphyxiation and those younger than ten are caused from hot dogs, okay, well I understand
*  I understand little kids the parents don't know how to do the Heimlich
*  There's a certain age where you're on your own if you choke to death on a hot dog there's a certain age
*  Okay, man
*  Do you know how to give yourself a Heimlich?
*  But that's what you got to do
*  Find a chair and like get this throw your body food out chuck the food out of your mouth. You don't just like
*  Hmm
*  Yeah, just kind of like good maybe like in an upward like in an upwards motion
*  And you force it right you force the air out
*  So what the fuck do you do do you have to get them bending forward you do right so that the food when it pops out
*  Doesn't fall fall right back in there their hole
*  Right actually it says self. I'm like should be a fist. Yeah punch yourself right in an upward motion
*  Yeah, the chairs good okay, so this guy slammed his hand
*  It's like a gable grip like you're trying to take someone down slam it into your
*  Okay, so right where your solar plexus is careful, but what?
*  There's so many different kinds of chairs. Oh hey if you're choking you gotta find the closest one
*  I think I heard that they break they people break ribs doing this all the time makes sense and then
*  CPR people break ribs doing that to make sense you push it on the ribs trying to get someone to breathe
*  Trying to get that food out of their stomach that fucking hot dog
*  What if the chairs like a throne like a cool like vampire throne, and it's like sharp on the top
*  Then you're gonna impale yourself. Yeah, don't do then you that's when you do the don't do the Heimlich when you're near a vampire
*  It's fucking life lessons here
*  Mm-hmm
*  Yeah
*  You ever see that Gary Oldman Dracula movie
*  Dude, that's that's a classic with Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves
*  You ever see that before he got too far a picture of Henry Heimlich the guy who invented it popped up no
*  He came up with it 1974 is when I was promoted so like what if fucked people do before that died
*  They only had been doing it for like 50 years stabbed themselves with a fucking
*  Wow sure there was something but like wow the self Heimlich maneuver maneuver excuse me a poem by Fred Peyton
*  So there it is
*  Heimlich maneuver to dissolve Heimlich recommended
*  Standing behind the person wrapping arms around. What does it nine? What is that around nine clasping hands? What does that mean?
*  Oh and oh and clasping hands on to I never know what that sign is called
*  I know what it is. I know it's and I know it's ampersand once you said it spell it
*  But if you but if you said to me what is that thing called before you just said that ability?
*  Oh the fuck that thing's called
*  Yeah, I don't know how you would do yourself you would lean forward I guess and just slam it in and how do you figure that out?
*  You don't you just like choke yourself with like just eat steak and then they purposely
*  Yeah, and then like well fuck. It's got to work
*  I think someone probably did it one time and then the other one ah
*  The other people went that's what we do write that down, but Heimlich. I didn't you said 1972
*  74 74 Jesus Christ I figured that would have been around
*  For years yeah hundreds of years
*  People just thought demons were taking you when you're choking on food
*  The witch jail
*  He's that's possessed grasshoppers
*  And the demons came and they took him I was eating hot dogs
*  17% he was fine
*  That's crazy more than fugu
*  That's how much better Japanese people are being humans the Americans
*  We die from hot dogs
*  They don't even die from this fucking super toxic thing
*  Where one drop the head of a pin could kill a whole human being they don't even dry that doesn't measure out to me though
*  by the way
*  Enough there's enough poison right in a pufferfish to kill 30 humans right but
*  one pin drop is
*  A lethal dose yeah, they have a very small amount of poison I guess
*  The policy before this was slapping somebody on the back
*  Until like 1970
*  Like research from this found out that it actually pushed the food further back down
*  So the Red Cross had to have like a do not allow anyone to slap you on your back if you're choking and try to dislodge
*  Food oh my god, and then like he said he read an article
*  Dr. Heimlich about people dying was the sixth most leading cause of death so he's like
*  What a wizard he is
*  It makes sense with hot dogs though because you get to bite off those chunks
*  You know like it's so easy to bite off
*  And if you're a glutton or if you just make a mistake
*  And you just bite off too big a race, and you think you're alright, and you like
*  What's the fucking solution there though?
*  I'm like maneuver vampire for him obviously bro
*  When you look at how many people died from choking ever
*  There's a lot that's why he was looking it up
*  It was like in one year six thousand people died and to say you never hear about it unless it was someone famous like
*  Kennedy's sister-in-law or someone died of choking on me. Oh really Wow I
*  Think I've only been in one dire choking situation happened. I
*  was at dinner
*  with my family at our house and I took a bite of
*  steak and
*  It just clogged me up fuck my uncle gave me the Heimlich maneuver shout out to what's his name?
*  Heimlich Henry Heimlich
*  Yeah
*  Have you ever been in a dire choking situation?
*  No, not really I've definitely been choking at points like I've had something like
*  But I either threw it up or something never where I was thought this is it. I'm gonna die I
*  Had it's terrifying I can only imagine have you been you've been there
*  Scary shit it's out just imagine enjoying a delicious piece of steak and then you're like
*  Yeah, it took a turn. Yeah, and now I'm dying and you could dive people around
*  You don't know what the fuck to do. You could die
*  I
*  Think I'm like say this all yeah, you can't be timid with that Heimlich maneuver
*  Yeah, you kind of really get yeah, you got to get after it because you might not have that much time
*  How many of those you get?
*  Heimlich's how many times can you force it?
*  You know I mean you could break someone's fucking ribs to you have to think about that
*  Yeah, you're doing like to an old lady and she's choking on something you might kill her you know in that yeah
*  Oh
*  Imagine your Nana she spits out the meat, but you killed her by giving her the Heimlich
*  Fuck that's an insane situation fuck
*  That has to happen has to have happened. Yeah, how long can a human hold their breath?
*  Minutes those free divers they can do like seven minutes. I think that's a lie
*  No, no no they can do it
*  Seven minutes yeah people have done more than that, but they've done it with like weird oxygen assist things
*  Angel not Chris Angel, but David Blaine. He did some crazy number of minutes, but he did something to himself
*  First right it wasn't just what do you know what he did Jamie?
*  We were doing the podcast that day I was trying to look into it. He I believe he just over oxygenated
*  oxygenated his body
*  Somehow or another I believe yeah by just breathing it in and then not moving at all
*  So he didn't use any of it, but he did like 17 minutes or something like that. Yeah something bonkers like that no
*  17 minutes is like almost a TV show
*  Yeah, that's an episode of Modern Family. Yes. I think it's 22 minutes from Modern Family. Yeah because of ads
*  That's nuts
*  That's a long fucking time to hold your breath. So how do you over oxygenate?
*  He has a Ted talk about I'm sure he probably explained a lot of it, but he had to get his heart rate down
*  He did it once and it didn't work and he panicked they had to go and save him
*  Oh Jesus whole thing because it wasn't easy to get in there towards the thing he did it, but he did it again
*  This is something about a dude like him that's willing to do
*  Shit that you you you would be like wait. Why are you even doing this?
*  How how can you do it and why are you doing this like remember when he was encased in ice?
*  Mm-hmm. Yeah, he was encased in ice for like a long ass time
*  It's a good angle. How long was he encased in ice for I?
*  Want to say more than 24 hours?
*  I think it was a long time cuz there was one thing he did in New York City where people could come up and see him
*  He was in a like like a water tank
*  Oh
*  What's in the box
*  Thanks dad, thank you sir
*  How did he do it
*  70 plus hours in frozen ice. Yeah, so this them taking him out
*  Is this the end
*  Shut the fuck up he lived in that for 72 hours
*  Lenny Kravis is like how is he doing this I need to be there
*  That's how badass it is when you just stand still for 72 hours
*  Like yo this guy's fucking crazy
*  Lenny Kravis lives on a farm in Brazil and he finds out that you're doing some crazy shit nice
*  I need to see this I need to be there live sit on top of a pole for a really long time of course
*  You know I've seen I've seen something like this before. I don't know if it was David Blaine, but
*  Monks do it and they have a way to like slow down
*  Metabolism so they can be up there for weeks and not eat and not drink anything
*  What does it say about 34 hours? You stood up there for 34 hours before jumping down?
*  Oh shut the fuck up. He stood on that pole like that for 34 hours
*  80 feet oh
*  I don't like this you seen him eat glass
*  That's so weird
*  That's such a weird thing to do eat glass or stand on all those things eat glass stand up there
*  He's up there on that pole covered in ice eating glass
*  for three years
*  That's a different kind of person right the art in that is that we know it's really hard to do and there's no way to
*  fake it
*  Right no, it's like it's crazy. It's not like illusion. No it's like
*  Mental fucking fortitude yeah, so he does illusions too right right a real magician right magician
*  But also can do that like that's just a mind. That's just that's a different kind of mind
*  Yeah, stand there for 34 hours on pole. He probably be a good fighter
*  Probably a man. He would never tap out you seen this one where he puts a frog live frog in his belly and like spits it
*  Back out alive did they x-ray is that an x-ray?
*  Imagine if they did it we got to x-ray the frogs first okay, okay? I'll let him out in a couple minutes
*  first to do the x-ray
*  See nothing but frogs no organs
*  It's just such a bad x-ray
*  Remotely real like we so your x-rays came back. How come the frogs are so clear, but you don't see anything else
*  It's so stupid
*  It's so stupid
*  you ever shot the
*  Boring company flamethrower. Yeah, yeah, we brand out of juice doesn't have any juice anymore. We've got to refill though. What is it propane?
*  Yeah, we got to refill the propane. Oh man. They got fucking rhino at the fucking gas station
*  Hook that fucker up to a fucking
*  Tank I know right yeah, we just got to hook it up
*  But the thing is like it's the perfect amount of propane because it's not very big you know see the tanks very small
*  Elon probably blew half of it out. Just showing it to me
*  He's crazy. Are you right out there in the hallway? Just blowing this fire fuck it?
*  This flamethrower
*  In the middle of the hallway, I'm like bro hi
*  That's how I met him
*  He comes in comes in with a flamethrower
*  Legitimately he's the sweetest guy very very nice guy sweetest guy
*  Yeah hurts me to the core that him and Johnny Depp want to duke it out
*  What's the both nice guys there's a there was a woman involved you know how it is oh?
*  The amber heard Johnny's ex-wife was involved with Elon apparently at one point in time
*  So they don't like each other they would love each other if they knew each other. I'm out of the game
*  Yeah, me too. I live in Utah. I just
*  I'm telling you goes pulls it up
*  Offers to train Elon Musk
*  Gregor come into this
*  well
*  Who which which one of his coaches is that?
*  the Kavanaugh
*  Because he has a bunch of coaches
*  So I can go it is Kavanaugh
*  I don't think they're gonna fight though
*  Is that a real thing no it was a joke that Elon apparently said at one point in time
*  Maybe I should have a cage fight with him like lol. You know like that kind of yeah
*  And then it goes he was upset at him or something
*  You know it's how it goes
*  I
*  Know everybody's
*  fighting
*  Not everybody, but when those kind of fights happen you're like I see what happened here. This is not complicated math
*  You know two good guys. I'm so out of the way crazy everybody's mad
*  Good it's good to be out of the loop. I think it's really wise that you live out there
*  I really do I agree because you're so wild like for a dude like you
*  It's good to be in a place where you see nature, and it's probably in a way
*  It's balancing and like there's there's something about
*  The the Utah Mountains to like that's a real mountain range
*  Yeah, you see that shit all the time when you drive around Utah. It's like it's very humbling
*  It's incredible. It's just like you're a fucking
*  Mm-hmm on the fucking entire globe also. It's like natural art
*  Like when you see mountains their natural art like if you drive through the mountains
*  It's like you're seeing an art gallery like a nature. It's beautiful to look at and it's free. Yeah
*  It does something to you like it excites you in a weird way like can you you could see a waterfall?
*  Coming off the side of a mountain and everything's lush and green you see you go into a flowing river
*  Man that does a thing to your body. There's a thing to your brain
*  It lights everything up, and that's the best especially for making music
*  Oh
*  That makes sense especially for making music because it's just like
*  Without sounding corny. It's like you you feel like you're a part of something
*  bigger, but you're so insignificant and then you can just say I
*  accept everything around me yeah, and
*  I'm relaxed and I'm at peace
*  you know knowing that you're just
*  The world spinning around you and everything happens for a reason and you can just sit there a
*  Hundred percent peace at ease and say I don't have to worry you know like I said earlier
*  La always something going on yeah, I couldn't do it so yeah
*  There's and it definitely affected my creative process for sure
*  We mean like going out. Yeah. Yeah, there's always someone hitting you up
*  You know I don't want to speak on behalf of everyone in
*  La or from La, but there's a lot of people who kind of want to drain you and
*  Well, you know what it is man. It's not that they want to drain you what it is is they're greedy
*  They're concentrating on themselves and when they're concentrating on you know they're trying to make it
*  They're trying to get something happening right and they're ambitious and they're self-centered in that way
*  I don't mean that as a pejorative right negative thing just they're self-centered
*  So they always want from you right and so they're draining
*  Like and when you're successful, and you're a guy who's got a lot going on they think there's a rub
*  I gotta get I gotta get the post Malone to get that rub right I gotta be able to somehow another gets
*  What do he's got hey man hit me up? Hey? Hey? I'm here. Hey. Hey. Hey. Let's do that thing right hey
*  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, let's go out. Hey. Hey. I want you to meet my friend right hey, hey
*  And like bro. I gotta make music
*  I'm good at one thing and that's using auto-tune to sing
*  You gotta make that music
*  I
*  Want you to hear some of the new shit? I think I would love to I think I would love to so what do you listen to?
*  Did I listen to a lot of shit? I listen to most like it varies I go on
*  Streaks of listening to like I'll get in a gangsta streak
*  I'll listen to a lot of classic like run DMC for a while
*  And then I'll go into like some old zeppelin and I'll get stuck on zeppelin for months
*  Yeah, and then I'll transfer over to some old Johnny Cash
*  I'll get into that for a while, and then I get into like I'll get into a moody mode
*  I'll need some Sheryl Crow in my life. Yeah, I listen to like you're my favorite mistake
*  I'll get into that kind of music man, and I I get into all kinds of shit
*  I go into these waves
*  But most of the time if you had to come in here on a whim and say what kind of music's playing it's classic rock
*  Almost always so easy that
*  zeppelin
*  Nothing wrong with that
*  I'd like nothing wrong with that at all. I like there's something about the 60s in the 70s
*  There's something about the fact that these guys were breaking out of this
*  Mold the society yeah had carved for them when they were children and here they are as adults in the 1960s
*  And they are just buck wild how heavy is Sabbath very heavy
*  For like just imagine like
*  Vinyl
*  Like vinyl Sabbath like and just like here's this record. I just picked up from the store
*  Let's spin that fucker and hope my parents don't hear
*  I'm 25 by the way, I can't
*  You probably listen to Sabbath on vinyl. I well I wasn't I definitely have but it wasn't the biggest Sabbath fan
*  I liked a lot of shit that was embarrassing like I was really into kiss when it was embarrassing
*  This is great. I love kiss, but when I was a kid it was a problem
*  Like other kids that found out you'd like kiss like what really oh, yeah
*  My god for whatever reason kiss got a weird there's a weird thing that happened with kiss
*  This is this is what's interesting. They didn't get any radio play a lot of people don't know this but when I was a kid
*  Kiss got no radio play no radio play
*  I don't know if it's because of politics or people just decided they suck because they wear masks or a makeup rather
*  I don't know. I don't know what it was
*  but for whatever reason it was really hard to hear a kiss song on the radio and
*  Every now and then you would hear I want to rock and roll all night. You like what it's on the radio. This is crazy
*  Wanna rock and roll like you'd be in your car driving that would come on you'd be so excited
*  Because you were a kiss fan and you don't kiss didn't get any love. Hmm, and then as we got older
*  I think people started missing it and then kiss made like reunion tours and they came back and put the makeup on again
*  and people got excited and and
*  Then people that were for whatever reason not kiss fans in the past became kiss fans in the present, right?
*  But when I was in the 80s, it was like a problem
*  If you love kiss people would mock you in the 80s, right? That's like fucking talaka like yeah
*  That was Guns N' Roses too, man, you know that was
*  I believe Nirvana came out with never mind
*  I was 89
*  91 was it 91 90
*  Yeah, that was around those those years, you know, and that just changed everything
*  Like Eddie Bravo, my friend Eddie's always in like that's what killed hair bands Nirvana killed hair bands. Yeah, it just came
*  It was so deep. You're like Jesus Christ
*  Like you couldn't listen. It was fucking heavy heavy
*  Heavy rape me
*  Rape me heavy singing a song called rape me heavy. Holy shit. It's like
*  What do you even
*  Do that song is so intense. It's like if you could take a person's emotions and their soul and figure out how to
*  Transfer it into into musical notes and sounds that's what it sounded like
*  That's it I mean that's what that's what it fucking is it's like fuck
*  Everything and here's what I'm gonna say
*  Like here it is. We should get play this
*  God damn. He's a bad motherfucker
*  Dave Grohl crushes it all of them crush crushes it. That was cool during the Nirvana thing
*  Did you watch my Nirvana thing? No, I didn't what would you do with Nirvana? We did a we did a whole
*  We did a whole fundraiser when was this this was fucking two months ago
*  But I've been I'm out of the loop
*  Since kovat, there's a lot of shit. I missed on I missed evil Superman. I missed you miss evil
*  You miss bullied Superman. I did I missed it. Yeah, so we did we did a whole set and it was cool to see Dave
*  Give his approval and Travis Barker played drums. It was cool to see Chris
*  You know Travis is the first guy to come in here with face tattoos, but you knocked it out of the park
*  Travis is
*  He's so cool, yes, I got genuinely cool guy
*  Yeah, really interesting like intense like as good a drummer as he is you cannot be that good unless you got some
*  Fire inside of you. Yeah, you know that dude's got fire inside of him, but he's super cool
*  Yeah, okay that I mean but like to be that good and so fucking into it man
*  He's that he's fucking got it. He I mean, that's the same spirit. It's just like
*  It's a spirit. It's just like
*  Fuck you. I'm gonna play music. Yeah, and this is how it's gonna be and he's a guy who likes old cars, too
*  He's a bet for the same
*  Yeah, he's like a dope blazer like a really cool custom blazer. I think yeah, he's got a lot of
*  One day I'll be that cool. I'm working on it's hard. It's hard to get that cool. It's tough. It's hard
*  Travis Barker's at a high level of cool
*  Cuz he's like a genuine human. There it is. Look at that thing. God damn that sweet. Holy fuck
*  Look at that. That is clean
*  Who made that thing it's hot Travis Barker's k5 blazer custom SUV topless
*  topless show the titties who made that
*  We should probably oh the light bar on top is gangster. It's a sick car. Yeah, that's
*  Kids got taste. It's got taste. Does it say the the people who built it?
*  well
*  You're gonna have to Google it kid
*  What is it?
*  Delmos speed and custom in Burbank, California
*  Whoo. Yeah, that's pretty beast
*  car shops are considered
*  They're supposed to be
*  Essential businesses you're allowed to still work on cars. That's what I'm so yeah
*  But that's one of the weirdest things about this pandemic is what's essential and what's not essential
*  like
*  It is who did who gets to the side exactly
*  Exactly. Is there a vote?
*  Who gets to the side? It's a it's a strange amount of power. It's not you and it's not me. No
*  It's a strange amount of power and what what's allowed to be open was not like they had bars were open
*  But then they wouldn't let comedy clubs open like that's an entertainment venue
*  But then so is the Staples Center like they're very different things
*  Yeah, you know one of them can have 30 people in it
*  It's like who gets to decide your restaurant can open because it's outside
*  And there's no way in hell you could figure out how to keep people apart inside. You just did did it for a while, right?
*  Like who's making the rules? Yeah, that's the whole that's the I whenever I touched down my my friend was like
*  yeah, all the restaurants just
*  Put some chairs and tables on the outside and yeah, that's what most of them did and that's very smart
*  They adapted a lot of them that could do that did that but a lot of most of them went under
*  I think it's more than 50% what if what if you're addicted to partying?
*  Then a nightclub is an essential
*  Business point what do people who are addicted to partying do what have they been doing besides partying?
*  Who's of the side unregulated parties at home and that gives people coronavirus
*  Don't they they always hear you always see that story. Here's the story. You never see
*  Bunch of guys got together all of them got tested. No one had coronavirus. They partied. They had a great time. Nobody got hurt
*  You don't see that start. You know who's doing that story right now Dave Chappelle
*  What Dave Chappelle is doing is testing everybody flying everybody out to Ohio putting on these great shows. He has music
*  He has comedy. He has a good fucking time and he does it outdoors
*  Yeah, that's what he's doing
*  How so like it's got a menu. It's a wedding chapel
*  Wow, so he's doing it on this stage that people get married on so it's like a stage like with the fucking poles and right
*  Steps to get up to it. That's the whole shit. That's for day. He wants to do a show
*  He figured it out. He wants to do a show. He needs to do a show. That's an essential. That's an essential thing for him
*  It's essential for people too because it's a it's another thing that makes people feel good
*  Like they're they're doing an investigation of the chain smokers
*  like the states involved in this investigation because they did essentially a
*  Car show where they did they were on stage and there was like 600 cars in the audience and they did their show
*  To people in parked cars like what the fuck is wrong with that
*  Why is that bad? No
*  Jesus no, they're all standing around
*  Oh, so it's supposed to be in cars and people just said fuck it. Let's get out of the cars and stand
*  Yeah, but it play that play that let me see what that is. Oh
*  Jesus Christ, this is a DJ only two second video. So
*  It depends Wow now it depends on intent. I think
*  For that's a concert it depends on intent well are there cars there was it a drive-in concert?
*  What does it say the crowd was estimated at 2,000 for the concert at Watermill ticket prices?
*  ranged from $850 to uber VIP options for
*  $25,000 that accommodated RVs
*  All profits were earmarked for charity. That's nice
*  City State of New York is now probing the concert
*  Are they probing looting to or just a concert? Did they have a they probing what happened in Soho or just just?
*  Story to us all recently. I just wanted to know too. Yeah, I'm asking for a friend
*  700 person Airbnb mansion party
*  around on Twitter for
*  $1,000 prize for a torque contest. Well, it's hard to twerk, but they're saying that's like, you know a
*  Super spreader party or whatever, of course. Yeah. Well, I got those fuckers that say oh Post Malone's here at this nightclub and
*  I'm not even in town. Yeah, that's crazy, right?
*  Shit like using yeah, and they people don't don't get their money back. Right people. Yeah, I'll into the club. Yeah
*  It's so weird now
*  I'm still curious about that the chain smokers deal was it a drive-in concert supposedly they sold cars
*  They sold cars 600 so that's not but that's not on them
*  Well people got out of the car, right? That's the thing like was it
*  Are you supposed to enforce that if they like say here's the thing if they only had it set up as a concert without
*  Any enforcement whatsoever on how close people stood to each other, right?
*  Whose responsibility is it if people get out and just start talking, right?
*  I guess this is what the promoter either said I don't know if they actually talked to them
*  But this is what they were supposed to have done or did do
*  The rating temperature checks upon entry
*  No, he said noted that concert goers went through a temperature check upon entry was not good enough really offered hand sanitizer
*  He jerk off with this once parked and had restrooms that were disinfected every 10 minutes. Oh awesome
*  Well, nine minutes is giving people cooties and then on the 10th some dude comes in and hoses it down told BuzzFeed
*  There were dividers separating individual parties in the pit area and that guests were also instructed
*  They would not be allowed to leave their design
*  Well
*  Designated but it's designed does for any reason other than to use the restroom, but obviously that's not really what's happening
*  Wait, what if if it's a drive-in show? Why is there a pit?
*  Right and also that the dividers between people that's horse shit fucking the air doesn't give a shit if there's like a little piece
*  Of cardboard here between you and the people next to you that your spit goes through the air and it gets to them
*  If you got it, they got it. I
*  Know and oh
*  And I I don't think it has to do with the with the boys in the group. I think it has to do with someone else
*  What do you think that's doing because I know the boys in the group?
*  What seems like sweet guys? I don't think it's their idea. Yeah, that's exactly what I think
*  I think right the total like it was a shit show that just got out of fucking hand also
*  Here's the other thing if you get a bunch of people in their cars drinking and they're all able to open the door and just
*  Socialize yeah, they're gonna do it. Yeah, and plus before that they're tailgating, right?
*  So people are tailgating before the show so they're cooking burgers having a hang of having a good time
*  Right drinks with each other and then the show starts they're gonna get out of their car and mingle with each other
*  They made new friends
*  You just pull up really close
*  Just touch mirrors. I mean there is a car a car at least. Oh, that's a car. Do what's the problem?
*  Other
*  Said that there was it was safe. They swear it was safe. It was safe
*  Sane well
*  Listen, it seems safe if you get away with it. Nothing happens if you get away with it. Nothing happens like oh my god
*  It was so safe. Trust me. It was so safe. Yeah, you get a kovat test
*  They find you don't have it after you go to that concert you go. Listen. It was so safe. It was the safest
*  It was unsafe. No one even can see it. You don't know if someone has it
*  I told you my friend Jack Carr got it did a fucking book signing
*  He caught it for a day a day. Yeah, he kicked it quick. He kicked it in a day
*  Yeah, I said it felt like shit for one day some people that's weird man. Oh shit my friend Michael Yo
*  That's what happened to his mom
*  Michael Yo was in the hospital for a long time man for like weeks and his mom got sick for a day one day
*  Right, then she kicked it
*  It's a fucking weird virus
*  It's weird even coming here getting pricked and she get nervous. Yeah, fuck. Yeah. I mean you're nervous before anything, right?
*  Yeah, for sure that one's a nervous one
*  But I don't
*  I made it nice to know
*  Scary fucking disease man. I don't know me. It's so weird. It's such a bizarre time
*  Here's what it's scary and what it's done no matter what even if you're not scared of getting it
*  Yeah, even if you think oh, I get it. It's just gonna make me sick for my days
*  I'll kick its ass even if that's true. It's scary for what it's done to the economy
*  Yeah, what it's done to civilization. It's in it honestly. It's terrifying and I saw
*  a
*  Son you can get a fine for not wearing a mask. Yeah, and sometimes it's up to 600 fucking bucks. Yep
*  Yeah, it's crazy. They're arresting people for keeping gyms open. I've seen that
*  The same people that didn't arrest the looters I think is it the exact same people yes
*  Arresting people for opening gyms like give people that like there's gonna come a certain amount of time
*  I don't know what that time is but here we are in
*  August it's basically August right and everything's still closed like how long we gonna do this for
*  We're gonna stay closed for a year. We're gonna stay closed for two years. What's gonna be left?
*  Nothing, so it's a complicated question because you don't want people to die
*  You don't want people to get it to have right diseases and get sick
*  So then you have to everybody has to live their life
*  You know everybody has to survive and fucking be able to pay their fucking bills and yeah exactly
*  So when do you when's that call get made? That's what's complicated about it
*  That's what no one from either side this is like one of the most truly human problems
*  We've ever faced because no one really knows what the right thing to do is
*  There'll be a lot of armchair quarterbacking after it's over where people who you know people die
*  People look back on and say they should have done this they should have done that well
*  That's great, and maybe maybe some people had a better idea of how to handle it, but it's just guessing
*  Right now. It's just guessing yeah, it's fucking weird, dude
*  It's weird to me that there is a
*  It's like me in school having to fucking tuck in my shirt
*  Or else you get detention or whatever. It's weird to be
*  Forced to wear something
*  Right so that's what you feel about the mask. I see what you're saying. Yeah, you know it does work right?
*  That's what's weird about it
*  If you wear a good mask it actually does prevent a lot of transmission apparently that's all Japan
*  Why did I say it that way Japan? That's all Japan. I was in the middle of saying Japan
*  I stumbled through it some weird way
*  Words are hard. Sorry
*  Japan they they didn't shut their economy down. They just wore masks
*  Well, I mean that's yeah, they didn't suffer that many deaths either. It's really weird
*  The
*  I wonder I would like to see like a documentary on how Japan
*  managed
*  COVID-19 because they did an insane job
*  Maybe as good a job as anybody. Yeah, I think there's only a thousand deaths in all of Japan
*  Kyle Kalinsky was telling me about this and he sent me some article if you can't find it
*  I'll send you the article, but it's pretty crazy. It's it's all in how they never shut the economy down
*  They just all wore masks. Yeah, everybody followed the rules here and they contained it
*  That's the and that's and that no I mean at the end of day it all comes down to
*  Respect for other people sure right
*  That's what a mask is for right? Right. It's not it's not it's not a government thing. It's not like
*  You shouldn't you shouldn't be forced to wear a mask
*  But you should wear a mask right? Yes
*  Yes
*  Yeah, you should wear a mask. That's a good person, right?
*  And that's because I respect you as a fellow human. Yeah, it has nothing to do with being 600 bucks
*  That's what it cost that some places it's 600, but I saw what what is it in Beverly Hills right now?
*  What's the fine for? I saw it never fine 300 no fine for looting. Hmm
*  300 bucks for not wearing a mask in Beverly Hills definitely should wear a mask just so people feel better for now
*  I mean we got to get through this together
*  And that's I don't know about finding people for it
*  And the other thing was snitching they were paying people to snitch on people weren't social distancing
*  That was the mayor mayor of Cal a mayor mayor of Los Angeles
*  They they were like ordinarily snitches get stitches, but now snitches get rewards. They were literally giving people money or
*  Advertising I don't know they ever gave any money out advertising
*  They would give P give away rewards for people who turn in people who are not social
*  It's like they wanted to say something to the guy
*  Hey
*  Why not just say hey put your mask on bub. No, that's too complicated
*  You're asking too, but then you have to how long is the rebate?
*  Is it like like you have to mail in like that's a good question
*  Yes, I know
*  Haven't got paid yet, and they feel like a fucking terrible person like bro. I turned you in I need the money to pay my rent
*  Meanwhile months later, but the money still has come
*  If you la is rough, and I know I slept in a closet
*  $300
*  because maybe someone sees you eating and you don't have a mask on and
*  Then you were stuck with a fucking ticket. Yeah
*  That it blows my mind. It's weird. It's all about fucking the responsibility of and your character really if you snitch and
*  They don't pay you what do you do who's gonna? Who's gonna want to hear you whine if you snitch like hey?
*  I uh I turned in with this family next door. They were having a picnic and I never got my reward
*  I don't even know how that works. How about lost dogs?
*  Do they ever pay the cash amount they say they want them they never find them lost dogs
*  Jesus Christ, that's dark. They're coyote food
*  That's true when I drive through my neighborhood, and I see like a poodle on a sign. I just make the sign of the cross
*  That's it, baby
*  You don't even try
*  You're you don't even see it and you're like poodles gone. I gotta keep my eyes peeled
*  How many coyotes are on my neighborhood I've lost 19 chickens I lost 19 chickens in my neighborhood
*  I'll hear kind of fucking rough dude
*  We lost them one at a time these motherfuckers and then the last I guess we had like 11 of them left
*  after the fire
*  After the big fires out here we had they burned down the chicken coop
*  But they were still alive
*  And there was like I think 11 of them left and put them in a smaller chicken coop while we had the other one
*  Reconstructed and one day the coyotes got to it just destroyed it tore open the chicken coop and ate all the chickens
*  Through the wire. Yeah, they pulled the wire off. They pulled the the wood off of it. They're predators man. Yeah, they're real smart
*  They're devious little cunts
*  Utah they don't do they they don't pay you out here for dead ones and you get 50 bucks in the year
*  Yeah, and you talk that's worth it. The thing is you can't kill them
*  They just keep when you kill them it has the opposite effect
*  What happens with coyotes is they do that roll call with a yell out?
*  Right. Well when one stops responding like when one's missing everybody's checking it out
*  No, the one the females start growing more eggs
*  No shit. Yes, so they have more babies. So when female coyote coyotes are in
*  What is a clan a pack when female female coyotes are in pack and coyote goes missing all of the females
*  Generate more children. So if they would normally have like three kids now, they have six so it's like unlimited money
*  Well, they as long as you have to kill them all you have to kill them all because as long as you persecute them
*  What they do is they make more babies and they spread out and they're really smart. They're in every fucking city in this country right now
*  Yeah, they're weird
*  They're weird little tricks in my house. How big big really? Yeah, how big big mountain line?
*  Yeah, 150 how big is he bigger bigger?
*  those Utah cats are big cuz there's so many deer up there big fucker and
*  He always comes and hangs out. Oh Jesus same cat fuck him big
*  Shoot him right in the fucking deck. I'm not
*  No, I hang around your house if I see if I see if I see the ears go back, bro
*  That's when I'll shoot it. They eat dogs
*  Yeah, that's what mostly what they do yeah, it's fine dogs and shit things that are easy to eat they're so creepy
*  Well, that's the same. I had a I I still do
*  He stays with my parents right now, but I had a micro French Bulldog. Whoo and snack
*  for coyotes, especially out here whenever I lived down here, he would go out back and
*  Yeah, we heard him all night
*  It's
*  It's scary stuff man. They're a wild a weird wild animal. It's a small wolf
*  That lives with people
*  They're just slippery enough. It's small enough. We're not worried about
*  Yeah, just small enough right like if there was wolves on the street everywhere. We'd be fucking terrified
*  It would be like Little Red Riding Hood and shit because we would know they're gonna kill your kids wolves will kill your kids, right?
*  These are just small enough that we're like, I don't think it's gonna kill the kids
*  I think we'll be okay, right and let these fucking dirty twats living in a room three of them killing your cats
*  It's fucking insane killing dogs. Well, that's yeah, that's what I'm saying
*  Never mind. I'm not gonna say that cuz they're creepy the game the commission will come out. Oh, I'm not saying
*  I
*  If I see those years ago back
*  Yeah, well, that's self-defense though. Yeah, they did a study of cats in
*  Northern California like outside of San Francisco
*  They captured and or killed some of these mountain lions and they did a content stomach content thing of the troubled cats
*  The you know, they would cause problems eat people's cats and dogs and shit
*  They found out that 50% of their diet was house pets
*  There's most of these mountain lions out there just eating dog. Yeah, that's it that
*  That's half their diet man missing dogs
*  We think about all the people out here just if you had an aerial view of people and how many people have dogs
*  Thousands and thousands of dogs and these cats just stealing them out of backyard. Yeah
*  Just jumping in stealing them out of backyards
*  You never know it happens and people don't know and they don't know what to do. They call their friends. They put up that poster
*  We're just trying to get fluffy back the photos
*  Cash or miss them and you find them. There's money. We have money. I just go he's they ate him
*  We're surrounded by these creepy predators mountain lions. No one ever sees right there killing
*  Multiple deer a week. There's not a lot of cougars out here. There's plenty
*  Just not the fun kind. Ah, there's there's a lot of those kind but there's also mountain lions
*  There they have me Griffiths Park, there's one that they there's a photo of a one that I have out there
*  I remember it. I see the one that I have out there the phone. It's a famous photo of the one
*  It's it's a huge cat that's walking in front of the Hollywood sign
*  It has a big collar on it like cuz they GPS track them, but this fucking thing is in Griffiths Park
*  It's right outside. Look at that that motherfucker that giant cat. Look at his car. I'm sure it's amazing picture
*  That cat is in the Hollywood Hills
*  His name's
*  Chandler that's Mikey
*  He's huge he's massive it's so big I wonder what it weighs
*  Isn't that one dead didn't that one die?
*  That one's still alive. Fuck. What's his real name 22? That's his name
*  That's what they call him. They name them numbers instead of giving them names because they don't want to feel bad when they die
*  Urban carnivores look at him that old warrior. She's out there eating skunks and shit. Oh damn. That's a big fucker
*  That's a big fucker. Where where was it? It was out here too. Like wasn't
*  Imagine if you're hanging out
*  You're sitting on top of the hill. Let's just get it. Let's go to make up point
*  Just get out of the car. Have a glass of wine. You see that thing coming up the hill right out. You're like fuck man
*  What do you do what do you do you break the fucking wine bottle on the ground like you're in an old movie
*  Fucking revenant. Come on motherfucker
*  Yeah, like the gray remember
*  Did you ever see that one?
*  There was a Liam Neeson moving the wolves were coming after him and he broke bottles and stuck him inside of his knuckles
*  I did see that movie. It's snowy everywhere. Yeah
*  I'm thinking about
*  Leo
*  Fightin the fucking bear. Yeah, you know that was based on a real guy
*  That movie was based on a real man. He must have been a mother fucker
*  I remember that I love how he has that like
*  Cowl neck sweater. Yeah
*  It's warm and comfy most certainly I'm just fucking killing a pack of wolves in my fucking cowl neck
*  Yeah with broken
*  airplane booze bottles shoved in the air pods
*  Doesn't he have in each knuckle? Yeah, that's what he had. He made like a
*  Makeshift brass knuckles
*  He's got a knife. He's ready to go to the death with these wolves. That'll take three seconds
*  Congratulations, you got a shitty decision-making gaff tape air pod tree, bro
*  tree and wait
*  Okay, the fucking David Blaine can stand still for 38 hours
*  You can't get up in a tree until these wolves get bored. That's true wolves can't climb trees motherfucker
*  But do they get bored? We'll find out
*  Find out how long do you wait for them?
*  Well, it's one of two decisions either you find out how long they get bored and you go where they can't go or
*  You fight them to the death and that takes three seconds. You have two choices. You got to fight the biggest one
*  Bro, they act they're gonna tear your hamstrings apart
*  No, you got a first thing because once you fight the biggest one
*  They're gonna think you're that you're the leader of the pack
*  First thing they're gonna do is they're gonna send some little bitch ass wolves because it's all it needs to kill you and they're gonna
*  Eat you asshole first. I would love to I would love to see a little bitch ass wolf try to beat my ass. I
*  Would love that
*  No shot in hell any bitch ass wolf is kicking my ass I want to fight your king
*  Take me to your leader
*  But getting killed by wolves is probably one of the worst ways to go because it takes a while
*  What about like a bad of acid? That'd be a bad too. That'd be bad
*  There's something terrible about some knowing that something's killing you to eat you though
*  You know like wolves killing you to eat you like you're looking at I'm like ah and then
*  ripping apart your chest
*  Some extra terrifying you could give him a fucking kick
*  You could just kick the wolves into fucking oblivion nonsense wolves think about what wolves can do they they're 150 pounds
*  They can run 35 miles an hour and they can do it for all day. They go all day
*  They're made on a wire if you grab the hold of a wolf
*  They don't even feel like it they don't even feel like an animal get them in the court. It's get them in the clean
*  Yeah, good move. What are they gonna do if they can't bite you? They'll claw you. Yeah, that's pretty rough
*  I'm gonna do some Tai Chi on them
*  Side-step just imagine if mice took jujitsu
*  They can keep their fucking centipede from eating them brain first
*  What a weird world nature is man, it's terrifying. Yeah, it's just one thing eating
*  Another thing getting eaten by a third thing and then what's what's more terrifying about that centipede eating the mouse
*  The fact that a centipede does that and eats a mouse brain first or the fact that people set it up and filmed it
*  Knowing how it was gonna go down right and wanting to show people what happens when a centipede meets a mouse
*  So they left this mouse in this total unnatural environment that mouse was out in the wild
*  Centipede probably rarely gets a hold of a mouse like that, right?
*  Mouses faster fast as fuck. He knows jujitsu
*  Any knows jujitsu like that centipede like go back to that video with the centipede the mouse
*  Chance of getting away in a real-world environment or an aquarium, right?
*  It's but it's not a real-world environment, but in a real-world environment if the mouse had a chance to scramble
*  Do you think you could have got away?
*  Cuz that's the thing. It's like is that a fair fight?
*  like if a big guy is
*  Trying to chase down a small fast guy in a large area
*  It's not gonna happen. He's not gonna catch him
*  But if you leave him in a tiny little room, then they can grab them. Yeah, that's kind of what happened there
*  That's an unnatural environment. Yeah, it's not this is it was first for graphic out of different version of this
*  This is a grasshopper house. This is a little more of a fight. Oh, those are vicious little mice. Look at them
*  They're going to war. Yeah, fuck it. Oh my god
*  The mouse is attacking them and biting it and then jumping away again
*  This is lit very well, and it might be set up
*  They're right, but I don't know how you get cameras so good to capture all this
*  I think the creepiest part of whole deals is legs, dude
*  I'm glad you think like you do Jamie cuz you're right this could this is probably more murder porn
*  Oh
*  Bitch bite your fucking head off. Look at him. Oh and then he gets to eat him. Oh, yeah
*  That's what they do
*  That's they go out. That's where the flavor is asshole first
*  Look at you don't need a different kind of mouse though than those little bitch ass lab mice that they threw in that aquarium
*  Those little lab mice can we watch a snake in a mongoose?
*  Mongoose beat the snake to the fat. Yeah mongoose is mongoose is the best bike. Here we go as a kid
*  This is a different mouse. Oh shit, but not this night. Oh we clipped him
*  And not on this night, oh the system this night the centipede wins oh my god
*  I poked him look at that they he hurls himself at the mouse. Oh my god the mouse ran off
*  It's like this is bullshit. Oh, you got a thing. Oh, you're gonna war looking that's cool
*  What is that?
*  Kung Fu mantis holy shit. That's a real thing
*  Okay now imagine that the size of a horse running down Central Park taking out people
*  We're so lucky. We're so lucky. They're eating big tiny things
*  Right. No. No. Yeah for sure dude. Oh, that's my boy that bullets would be just bouncing off that thing
*  Yeah, you think about that like existential
*  Exoskeleton yeah
*  If the size you can crush it and you hear the crunch mmm, but at a larger scale
*  It's probably bulletproof. Yeah, you ain't crunching shit
*  You got a big one the size of a horse. Look at that thing. That's beautiful. What is that man?
*  What is it called?
*  There's like a lot of species of row wait
*  Menteces
*  That is one of the craziest looking insects I've ever seen that's beautiful
*  Wait, are they gonna fight it looks like they're going to war or are they friends back up a little bit so I can see
*  The the the kung fu man is go through his kung fu because he actually does do kung fu
*  When you saw the moves that the mantis makes when he sees the other
*  Beautiful they are
*  God it's amazing. But the fact that that little one. Oh, we got snatched up son
*  Welcome to the jungle how fast we got fun and games
*  Size does it he's like I'm gonna eat you that's great. You know what this is. This is like real kung fu
*  Like you think you have like power over the larger opponent but only so much
*  Well, is he oh that's a different mantis
*  Capturing like this is a jumping spider. That's what it's called
*  No, there was a picture of a spider in here somewhere. Look at that mantis. How many fucking mantises are there?
*  Manti and time meant to see
*  Imagine being a bear
*  And being in a river, okay
*  Grabbing a fish and eating it alive. Yeah
*  Probably feels amazing
*  Tastes so good. You're hungry. Never know where your next meal doesn't
*  Just biting into a salmon
*  Just imagine. Okay, imagine being a big mantis and picking up a little mantis and eating them and eating him alive
*  I'm his friends. Look at that
*  Fuck you and your whole neighborhood. I'm meeting your friends. I
*  Mean he's enormous that's like a it's almost like it's it's like a giraffe eating a person, right?
*  Is it as big as he is?
*  So we pull up the grass eating a carrot that one look at that one
*  What is that called?
*  Ghost it's a ghost of real that is so crazy a ghost mantis you there's a green bean
*  He's on a leaf. I thought he's on a big green bean
*  He's on a leaf I thought he's on a big green bean what a trick what's your favorite vegetable?
*  Is it green beans no, oh, that's mine garlic snap peas those are really good
*  Are they snap peas yeah garlic on it they put they make them with garlic but what's your favorite raw vegetable?
*  Hmm probably like bell peppers cuz they're not really a vegetable. It's like a fruit. It's a fruit
*  Is it like a bell pepper fruit or vegetable?
*  Straight up vegetables, I guess I like green leafy things, but I don't know if I like them or if I know they're good for you
*  You try raw green beans. They're pretty good
*  They're the best. Okay, if you got a plate of
*  delicious ripe
*  Watermelon next to some bullshit ass green beans which one you're gonna reach for it depends on if I'm feeling fruity or if I'm feeling
*  Veggie to be
*  vegetable II
*  Yeah, I rarely would eat a salad if it was hot out and it was right next to like cold oranges, right?
*  Perfect oranges those you know those oranges when you pull the peel back. It just goes away
*  Just goes away. Look it's it wants you to eat it. Yeah, you know, you don't have to struggle
*  It's like a silk garb yes, I know beautiful lady
*  Yes, it just drops and you peel those little slices and put them in your mouth. It's just this
*  explosion of moisture and flavor
*  Fuck your green beans, bro
*  Hey, eat the whole fucking packet green beans and you can send a fucking big wolf
*  I don't want to fight the little bitch ass wolf
*  I get it when people are starving to death
*  But the fact that you would ever choose Brussels sprouts over a delicious apple is ridiculous
*  It's different though, it's good mouth flavor, they're different apples the way to go different textures different flavors
*  For sure, I'm not arguing because I believe it just seems like something to talk about
*  our ghosts real I
*  wonder
*  He believes in him hundred percent, right it's real
*  Okay, but how much of that show that they do and they're like go let's go in the basement. Look night vision
*  What was that cut to commercial like how much of that?
*  How many how many times have they ever caught an actual ghost on their TV show a lot?
*  I think ghosts are probably real but the ghosts that show up on TV are probably hacks. It's real
*  I was there shitty ghosts and watch my episode. I believe you
*  That a mama movie that I was talking about like if that was real
*  If you see mama at the end at the end of the movie you get to see like a real good image of mama
*  Mama's like floating
*  Floating over this this person
*  If that was a real thing and you didn't have your camera out and it just went away
*  And then you had to tell people would you even tell them?
*  Yeah, what would you tell them? Like if you were you know what the fucking tell them
*  You just be like you'd probably tell if you were your friends, but you wouldn't go down Facebook
*  You wouldn't put it on Facebook. You wouldn't put on Instagram
*  You might tell your friends. It's like if you saw a UFO
*  If I saw a UFO legitimate UFO, I saw something I couldn't explain that I'd have to tell people here I'd have to you
*  Never seen a UFO. No, I don't think so. I
*  Don't think so
*  Nothing that really stands out. I think I thought I saw something when I was younger, but it's not a strong enough memory
*  Could have been a jet fighter, you know when a fighter jet flies by, you know, they do
*  Exercises all the time like there was one time they launched a missile off the California coast. I
*  Forget who what it was it Edwards Air Force Base? I forget who launched it, but it was crazy
*  I was driving down Melrose and I saw it fly across the sky and everybody thought it was a UFO people are pulling over
*  Like what is that? What is that people other cameras out there looking out the window? You see this streak flying across the sky
*  You remember SpaceX launch?
*  Didn't see it in the flesh. I only saw it after the launch and shit. That's pretty crazy. It looked bizarre
*  Did you see it outside? Yeah, where did it launch from? I have no idea somewhere here. Did it launch from here? Jamie?
*  Yeah, I just saw it online after it done it and
*  Vandenberg
*  Okay, and we looked up and it was just like yeah that and we were like what the fuck is that?
*  What time when was this? This was I lived in Tarzana same place. I saw that same place. I saw that like 17
*  Oh, yeah, that's right. No, you know what I did see this. I did see this too
*  Same place. I saw that like
*  Like big-ass fucking maybe I didn't I don't remember if I saw this or if I pretended I saw this
*  Yeah, I think that's it I
*  Think maybe I knew it was happening what makes something look like that I
*  Think it's the thrusters
*  You know giving off fire, right? There's fire coming out of the back end of it and it's going incredibly fast
*  So it's streaking through the sky. It's causing a disruption in all of the
*  all of the moisture in the atmosphere
*  So, you know you've got something that's going insanely fast with an immense amount of power
*  Just burning water just burning water vapor and then the condensation in the air
*  Like that's what when people get confused about like oh my god chemtrails are real. Look up at the sky
*  When you see planes and you see those trails behind them. Yeah, all that is is the heat of the engine
*  Interacting with the water vapor that's in the air the condensation and it creates fake clouds people like they're making clouds. No
*  They're making clouds no
*  They are making clouds. Yeah, but they're not doing it on purpose. It's just a byproduct of jet engines
*  Doesn't the Kremlin do that?
*  Definitely people do that control weather. There's definitely people who not only do they control whether in Abu Dhabi
*  They make it rain once a week. They have 52 weeks of rain a year in the
*  ions and shit
*  It's cloud seeding they use but it's a science and cloud seeding is a hundred percent verified science
*  They've had it forever and they've used it to manipulate weather in a bunch of different circumstances
*  They've used it to cause rain in places, but it's like an established science. It's like silver the silver something silver
*  So what is it? What is the shit that they use?
*  silver surfer
*  Yeah, they impart the powers of the silver surfer
*  But they do something where they spray things into the sky and it forces the clouds to coalesce
*  I'm doing a shitty job of explaining it, but they know how to do it in Abu Dhabi
*  Those dudes do it once a once a why not no shit
*  They're like wouldn't it be great if it rained here once a week and it's great here
*  But wouldn't be great is that bad is it bad? It's a good question for Earth
*  You can't play God
*  This is they fly out and add stuff to a
*  Cloud that already has a little rain present then they fire a salt flare into the cloud to enhance the rainfall
*  Whoa? Yeah clouds have two air masses one is
*  Updraft and one is downdraft what clouds are clouds are alive, man
*  But if I was living there and someone came to me
*  Hey, do you we have a service we offer where we can make it rain once a week. I'd be like, oh, yeah
*  Once a week. Yeah, let's do it man. Yeah, let's do it
*  So they have 52 weeks of rainfall. They have like once a week it rains 52 rain falls a year
*  Everything stays moist smart if you can do it if it actually works, but what does it do?
*  Is it?
*  Shoot ghosts and what a long-term effect. It's the tears of all the dead people
*  What dead people people have died the past all of them? That's what is you're praying for more tears. That's what rain is
*  That's why Seattle so sad
*  It's all dead people up there think about
*  Weather in relation to music is interesting it is yeah also heroin use right whether in relation to heroin use
*  Yeah, really? Yeah Pacific heroin in general or drug use in general drug use in general
*  But it appears that like the people that I've talked to that lived particularly my friend Joey Diaz who lived in the Pacific Northwest
*  He's like man is something about that area where it's all heroin a lot of heroin up there and Joey
*  You know he has a lot of experience with drugs and he was to he lived up there for a bit
*  He was like dude. It's just a lot of heroin. Yeah, I
*  Think it's a sadness. You know the lack of vitamin D lack of sunlight
*  I mean we didn't I don't think people really truly understood how bad that was for you to be
*  Vitamin D deficient like that and the fact that that's the best way we get it is from the Sun yeah
*  That's why like when you're out at your place man
*  In your Utah this clear skies, and you just fucking just just close your eyes and face towards the Sun you feel on your face
*  It's nice man. That's a love hug from the universe the fireball in the sky makes you vitamins
*  The fireball in the sky is making me vitamins the fireball in the sky makes you vitamins. That's what it is
*  It's crazy it is crazy, but even in Utah even during the winter times it's
*  super overcast and
*  snowing and shit, but
*  You still
*  Get that same kind of vibe
*  It's maybe that's because you experience the the warmth
*  Utah's not overcast like the Pacific Northwest is that it's yeah close. It's like London, too
*  It's like the fog like the it's heavy
*  It's heavy, and it's dense mmM. You know yeah
*  There's something about that kind of shit that it's fun for a while right after while it wears on every day
*  Yeah, every day over and over yeah, the dudes that I know that sustain it they seem weary
*  You know my friends that I know from the Pacific Northwest is something about them. There's a weariness to them
*  That concerns me even the healthy ones they don't
*  They seem weary I mean maybe this is obviously just the people that I know, but there's something about them man I
*  Just think you need we need sunlight. It's good for people feels good
*  That's why you like to go on vacation like you don't have to live where it's dreary, right?
*  And I think look if you look at the biggest political upheavals the biggest these these
*  Protests that are getting crazy with they're trying to burn down courthouses and shit. It's Seattle and Portland are the craziest
*  Seattle and Portland are way wilder Seattle. They took over six blocks of the town
*  Set up their own government put up their own borders use their own
*  Security in place of the police
*  They wouldn't let people in I mean they wouldn't let the police in they they set it up for they were there for weeks like that
*  That's not happening anywhere where it's sunny out
*  That's that's I think it's more likely to take place there, it's fucking celestial I suppose like human behaviors
*  kind of fucking out of our control and all
*  Lies within the environment, I guess I guess not so totally accurate though because they really did fuck up LA to
*  LA went pretty goddamn crazy. I'm here LA seems to have calmed down
*  At least a little bit or as it only seems to have ramped up more in the Pacific Northwest
*  But goddamn, it's beautiful up there in the summer
*  I'm a nut for pine trees pine trees
*  Just like looking at them. They're incredible and they smell good. They do smell good
*  Yeah, you wake up in the morning and even that's why like I don't know if I could live there
*  But like being in the northwest the Pacific Northwest is waking up there is special
*  You know, it does feel different
*  Hmm. It's like there's like a certain
*  right smell in the air
*  Yeah, it's nature. It's real nature, you know, it's unmolested nature
*  Well, you're smelling is the same thing that people smelled if they lived there a thousand years ago, yeah in Utah there's smog
*  and especially in Salt Lake
*  Smog gets heavy
*  But where I'm at, it's not so bad
*  but you can see it like
*  Sunrise you can see it all
*  How he gets it bad that was one of the craziest things about covid is when the lockdown hit and people weren't driving
*  They're like the air quality has never been better
*  Like Los Angeles air quality is amazing
*  Like people like go outside breathe the air. This is crazy that makes a difference
*  Oh, it makes a huge difference if cars aren't driving and makes a huge difference
*  it's probably a big part of the problem here and
*  That's also going to be a good argument for electric cars and it's also going to be a good argument for autonomous vehicles
*  less fires and accidents and shit
*  Where you from I was born in New Jersey and mostly grew up in Boston
*  You know what? I lived out here for a while lived in California when I was a little kid
*  Are you I don't like sports sports are whack. I don't know anything about them
*  I'm a professional sports commentator who doesn't know the rules to sports. I
*  Appreciate the athletes. I appreciate what they do like I
*  You know enjoy watching like Michael Jordan highlights or Kobe Bryant highlights or something like that
*  Football players who do crazy shit. I love watching them, but Dallas Cowboys. I don't fuck. There's no it's not it's not because it's not exciting
*  I've watched Super Bowls before they're fucking exciting, but there's only so much time in a day and already my schedule full
*  Full up with shit. I'm interested in I
*  Can't get into I can't start following the NBA try to figure out all the games or Major League Baseball
*  Oh, was it National League? I don't know American League like what I don't know
*  Ball works they play so many damn games play so many games then who's in the playoffs and why?
*  It's like what's happening here, but it gives people a lot of fucking entertainment man
*  If you're bored you know like for a lot of folks that are stuck in a shitty job
*  Just like we were talking about driving that 68 charger or a 68
*  Camaro to work for a lot of dudes stuck in it in a job that doesn't give them any thrills
*  And they know they have to go they have to be up in the morning
*  They don't have time for anything other than watching something
*  And they can watch a basketball game and get very invested in the fact that they want their team to win or watch a football
*  Game or a baseball game right they get invested come on Patriots
*  Come on. Let me correct. What do you got? What do you got there? Oh shit? Yeah, Dallas
*  Dallas he's a Cowboys fan. I can tell
*  James from Columbus, Ohio
*  Got some good Buckeyes on the Cowboys yeah, of course that everything comes out of Ohio
*  Something weird about Ohio
*  Yeah
*  Football's an awesome sport. I wish it didn't fuck people's brains up as much, but that's just how it is with everything everything
*  Everything dangerous everything risky you run the risk of getting injured. I just hope they figure out a way to fix brains
*  You know fix brains or fix helmets. I don't think that's gonna help
*  When you see some of these guys the the speed that they run at each other and they're colliding
*  You just the fucking physical strength that these people have if you saw what Zeke run an NFL
*  And I say this God Zeke just takes a fucking hit dude fucking top, and I'm like
*  Are you okay, and then he gets right up and does it again it's it's
*  It's like so much respect to fucking to fighters to
*  Fucking football players basketball players everybody absolutely they all deserve a lot of respect, but this is just a danger to football
*  I think that's not in as many other. This is just my looking at it. I guess a real danger to fighting
*  There's no doubt
*  But in fighting it's there's a person in front of you
*  And they're trying to do stuff to you and you should know how to avoid it if you don't that's just how the game works
*  But in football there's like dudes running at each other. I mean you're gonna get hit yeah 20 miles an hour
*  They're going so fast. They're so strong, and they're running at you, and you're running and they're running
*  What about rugby what about rugby? There's something pure about that right because they don't have the pads
*  I don't think people would attack the way they attack now if there was no pads
*  That's an argument for football. That's a weird argument right
*  It's like make them play with no helmets and see how they play like yikes I
*  Think they start I was looking at this one time
*  I think that like the football protection started from different injuries like brain injuries were obviously never a worry
*  spinal injuries injuries are huge in rugby and they were big and football before to like the
*  injuries were what they were trying to prevent for a long
*  Oh
*  Spine injury people get paralyzed and you show that TV. It's scary is
*  That makes sense anymore
*  Wow, so what do you risk do you risk that?
*  or the brain damage
*  But that I don't know because there's people who?
*  Are so passionate about it 100%
*  Yeah, no like no one I would know it shouldn't be able to do it
*  Yeah, but people should know what it is you know when you when you're playing it. What was the movie that Will Smith did yeah?
*  Concussion that's based on an actual doctor who yeah, I figured out what was going on the
*  You know it's a fucking amazing sport though when when it's going when you're watching crazy shit happen on the field
*  And you want you like I need to be there and see one live because that's probably when you really get an understanding
*  Moving
*  That's what is so God can watch
*  The roof open so you allowed to be there live no not yet
*  Ohio Stadium is saying they're gonna have 20% capacity
*  Maybe I don't know how much those tickets are gonna be our rare
*  They'll be or whatever, but people probably will be able to be in person at football games if they happen
*  As limited number of people but god that's so weird. You know it was bizarre to watch in the last UFC
*  No one in the fucking audience strange right and you get to hear those fuckers getting like fucking just cracked on the head
*  dude
*  It's like something very exciting about it man. It's something. I almost like about it more
*  Watching it that way yeah
*  It's kind of like you're more there
*  Well, it's just there's no there's no denying that
*  Like a big crowd an awesome crowd like a Conor McGregor crowd is crazy. It's a spectacle see you know
*  We've seen all those people screaming and cheering and I remember he had Sanado Connor sing for him
*  I was like holy shit, man
*  There's like green smoke in the air and everything like it was amazing and everybody's going crazy when Connor makes his way to the cage
*  Everybody's gonna be the way
*  It's just the energy in the room is undeniable. I mean it's amazing, but there's also something amazing
*  About these two dudes in front of each other right where there's no crowd no one around and you hear everything you hear all the impacts
*  You hear them breathing here the fucking shit to each other the the coaches the corners and everybody everything
*  It's so different man. It almost makes you think that this is like really kind of the best way to do it
*  Like I want people to be able to see it live for sure, but there's something about
*  There's a purity to no audience. This is what I'm saying this from a real selfish place right because I get to be there
*  And I get it and I if yeah
*  I mean if they could open it up and it would be safe and everybody can sell tickets don't
*  100% would want the audience right full don't get me wrong
*  But there's something about when you're there and there's no audience right that you're you feel
*  First of all you feel very lucky. I feel very very lucky to be there like man
*  There's only like ten people in the room watching Tyron Woodley versus Gilbert Burns
*  It's right with ten people and I'm one of these ten people calling this shit. That's crazy
*  but then
*  There's also
*  There's there's nothing influencing. It's just the fight man. There's no roar of the crowd
*  There's nothing nothing. It's just the fight and when you when it's just a fight man
*  You see it break. It's so clean like you see it all break down more and how much does that affect performance?
*  I'm I one asking you I wonder I think people vary
*  I think some people feed off the crowd and they love it and they love the pressure and then some people they're better off
*  If there's no crowd right some people probably fight better. It's like almost like a
*  Sparring session in an empty gym, you know, there's no one there
*  sometimes sometimes the
*  Physical people in front of you like just 20,000 people screaming and cheering for George St. Pierre and you're like fuck
*  And you got a real I like you have to perform all these people hate you
*  They all want you to lose and they'll stand there watching you about to fight one of the you know
*  Greatest fighters of all time if you're gonna fight George St. Pierre. Yeah, you're asking is he a nice guy
*  He's a super nice guy. I want him to be a nice guy. He is as nice as possible
*  Is that shit that guy's a real warrior in the best sense of the word meaning like if you wanted to have your kid
*  emulate someone who's a
*  martial artist a gentleman a really
*  interesting person who thinks a lot about things and treats martial arts as an
*  Art form and a discipline and a way to express himself in a way to show that he could be the best
*  Like he's as positive a human being as you're ever gonna meet George St. Pierre is like so positive in so many ways
*  he's such a nice guy and
*  Undeniably one of the best fighters of all time. Yeah
*  But such a nice guy like people would they would take him for granted
*  Yeah until it's too late
*  Yeah
*  This guy's a killer he's a fucking killer
*  Yeah, but when you're around him like he's so nice like you can't believe he beats people up for a living
*  He gets that shit out inside the cage. I saw Anderson Silver once in London. Oh, yeah, you see him fight
*  No, no, you saw him. I just saw him at the airport. I saw him at Heathrow
*  And I was like super super nice guy. Yeah, Anderson is so nice. He's one of my faves. He's so friendly
*  Izzy he's so nice. Very very very nice. I got to see Anderson when he first burst
*  I was a fan of Andersons before he made it to the UFC
*  He was fighting at cage rage in the UK. It was dominating people. I was watching these these videos online
*  I was like goddamn this guy is amazing
*  I remember we fought for pride too, but he was getting better and then it all came together for him during the years
*  He was fighting in the UK and that's when everybody had their eye on him and he beat Lee Murray and he beat Jorge Rivera
*  I mean, he was a monster Tony Fricklin. He hit him with this crazy elbow that he practiced that crazy upward step in upward elbow
*  He's a he was a wizard. So when he came over to the UFC
*  We caught him right at his prime and he's it's arguable that prime Anderson Silva
*  Was the best martial artist ever it's real arguable when he knocked out Vitor Belfort with that front kick to the face
*  I mean there's some of the shit that he did man
*  Some of the knockouts that he had like he had ESP he knew where people were gonna be right knuckles waiting for him
*  Right. He was when he was on and no fighter can stay on that level for very long
*  The human body just breaks down. Yeah, but there's a time where Anderson was so good
*  I'd put him up against anybody that ever lived
*  There was a time it was a few years
*  Where the rich Franklin years like Anderson was unstoppable. Where did where did he fight at?
*  Where what did he fight it what weight 185 is 185
*  So he's probably really walked around like 200 plus pounds and we'd cut weight. So what is that light? That's middleweight. He was a champion. Yeah, I
*  Would like to see John and Anderson that would have been an amazing fight in its day
*  It would be not a good fight now, right John's in his prime and Anderson is you know, I think right no
*  Like prime time like it would have been interesting
*  John is a big man. They they they I
*  Met John he's sweet sweet dude to super sweet guy and John is a big man. Yeah, he's big
*  He's from where my grandparents live. He could easily be a heavyweight
*  Easily if you wanted to if he decided he's like he's one of those guys that could
*  Go easily back and forth between 205 and heavyweight if he decided to take enough time to do it
*  He's fucking strong as fuck when you watch him grab guys and ragdoll him around. There's a there's a weird strength to him
*  That you see with some of these are really elite grapplers
*  Some of these guys like when you see like top of the food chain grapplers like yoel Romero
*  There's like something about grabbing people your whole life and throw it around like Brock Lesnar is grabbing people strength
*  Lesnar's a fucking dog. He was ridiculous
*  Yeah, dude, he was so powerful. Yeah
*  That motherfucker telling these what are these everything traps the trapeze he's like 43% traps
*  He's such a big human being man
*  Like that shit man. That's grown in a lab. That's some Viking DNA right there. That's not that's the lab of the sea
*  created that thing
*  That's 100% Viking DNA if you ever want to know what Vikings looked like when they were terrifying fucking Brock Lesnar
*  Yeah, somebody
*  Come on son look those motherfuckers a brass knuckle sword up the top of that is that is the hardest tattoo, too
*  It's hard as fucking trench knife
*  Fucking chest doesn't say death clutch on his back or something, too
*  I
*  Did some some Google what's on his back? He's got some crazy shit on his back. Just Google Brock Lesnar's back
*  Yeah, his back has like a skull. Yeah, click it there. There it is. That's his back. Yeah, it's got meat
*  Zombie meat hooks and below it is like a
*  demon head like okay, I
*  Love how they put the little bit of blonde
*  Yeah, man, that is one of the most preposterous humans that has ever existed
*  I'm trying to look come on. It's perfect. Look at the size of Brock Lesnar. It's perfect. Fucker was so big
*  The fact that this guy you gotta think of all his accomplishments because someone put a video up about him
*  And it showed all the shit that he did
*  He won a national championship and CWA division won all national championship in wrestling
*  He went on to play for the Minnesota Vikings
*  He went yes. Yeah, he played I don't know. He was on field. He got a tackle. There's a video of it
*  Then he went it was the Minnesota Vikings, right? He's a Minnesota guy. Yeah. Oh, so it was in training camp
*  So it was not an official game
*  Like a scrimmage
*  Something like that
*  So, okay preseason game. So he played preseason at least for the Vikings
*  Playing what linebacker?
*  But it was the Vikings, right
*  So so he goes from there to the WWE then he goes from the WWE
*  To the fucking UFC heavyweight championship of the world. Yeah, I
*  Mean there it is why he's Jersey number 69 to I like his style
*  So you have to I mean like legitimately wonder like how does one
*  How does one make a human like that?
*  You know how many humans ever existed crisper just all the shit that he's done. That's fucking crazy
*  Yeah, you need to crisper
*  Before he dies because if we have an army of Brock Lesnar's, yeah bulletproof Brock Lesnar's
*  That's what everybody's gonna be. Is he nice guy very nice guy. Yeah, very nice guy
*  He has a beautiful smile like a pure smile. You know what he is man
*  He's a guy who wants challenges, you know to do what he did when he was a WWE champion
*  So he's the champion of this wrestling entertainment thing and then he goes from that
*  Into the UFC and wins the real heavyweight title and beats a legend in Randy Couture. Yes
*  That's bananas. That's crazy. That's so rare that a guy can do so many fucking things. Yeah
*  Crazy what's his style? What what does he like? What's his?
*  He's a wrestler but he can do everything. I mean he could strike for sure. He's not guys out. He he's got
*  Ridiculous submissions. He crushes people's heads just a huge man
*  I mean, it's like there's not a whole lot of you have to be really good to beat a guy like that
*  And guys have beaten him. He's got tapped by Frank Mir got him in a leg lock caught him
*  didn't really understand submissions and
*  Alistair Overeem beat him after he had a
*  Alistair over his surgery dog. Yeah, I when he was at his best. He was a terrifying guy to
*  Lesnar is the battle of the specimens. Have you ever seen that fight between him and Brock Lesnar with
*  Yeah, yeah, that was the battle of the specimens
*  That was that was a strong ass motherfucker. He didn't even put any anything into that punch, too
*  Has to do his land he's so big this was you know, Randy Couture to you're talking about a guy who's one of the all-time
*  Greats he's on the Mount Rushmore for sure. That's how big Brock Lesnar is
*  Where's he talked to Randy about it after he goes that was a big son bitch. Where is he from Brock Lesnar from Nebraska?
*  No shit. Yeah, he's a Viking
*  Definitely if you got some DNA on that dude, oh my god, and he's fat. Yeah. Yo, he's
*  Very fast. Well, he's just a spectacular athlete. I mean you gotta you gotta deal with some crazy shit with this guy
*  He's a big fella and again
*  He did lose some fights, but you got to realize all the shit
*  He was doing instead of fighting for so long if Brock Lesnar had just decided to fight
*  From the time he left college if he never did football if he never fucked with anything else outside of actual
*  Fighting and just started smashing people. Oh my god
*  Who knows how good he could have gotten?
*  Like when he was in college if he just embraced MMA the way he embraced wrestling
*  Who knows I mean he this is when he beat Frank Mirroff that was a particularly brutal knockout
*  He was a undeniable man
*  it just makes you wonder with a guy like that like what have he started earlier because
*  Within his first few fights as a professional he wants the heavyweight champion
*  I think was like really early in his career like go go to
*  his mixed martial arts record
*  How many fights he had that's what I wanted to ask you to does that carry over?
*  What does what carry oh so
*  Wins losses that carry carries over from each program
*  Or each
*  Show so if it's like Bellator or anything
*  So you fight for Bellator and then you go to UFC
*  Do they have con they have contracts so like if you're a Bellator fighter you would be contractually obligated to fight only for Bellator
*  No, right, but do those wins from Bellator?
*  Sure, yeah, and that's across all yeah, you know all organizations
*  Yeah, it's your professional record and then you know, you don't have like a Bellator record or a UFC record
*  So was his fourth fight fourth fight as a professional he won the world title for Randy Couture. That's crazy Wow crazy
*  They defeat beat Frank Meier to defend it. Who's a fantastic champion Shane Carwin another amazing champion
*  Then he lost to Kane Velasquez and lost to Alistair
*  Then he beat Mark Hunt and he retired. I
*  Love Mark Hunt to mark hunt was awesome. I
*  Love max Holloway, he's amazing kickboxer to mark hunt like in k1. He was probably had his best
*  He was a k1 Grand Prix champion
*  You know, I mean he really learned like the wrestling the jujitsu and all that stuff later on, you know
*  When he was a kickboxer, he was he was one of the best alive
*  He's a tank too, man. Big guy. Yeah, he's like 510, but he's like that why good guy
*  Again that's like, you know, you got your Samoan DNA
*  You got your Viking DNA stout folk
*  Stout folk
*  We should probably end this podcast just fucking fighting. Oh, yeah, it's probably like it's been how many hours four hours we in four
*  Jesus Wow talking up storm son. Why'd the pee I?
*  Did too?
*  This is fun man. This is a ridiculous bullshit session. It was really what an incredible bullshit session. It was really good
