# Joe Rogan Experience #2132 - Andrew Schulz
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B75H_HkJQvE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day!
*  Like I think that CIA guy on with the hair?
*  Yeah. What do you think of that guy?
*  So after the pod...
*  I guess we're up. Let's go.
*  You want to go?
*  We're rolling.
*  Let's do it.
*  So he came on and he was very like...
*  First of all, he's very charming.
*  But like when you're talking to anybody who's worked for the CIA,
*  you're looking at him through the same lens as you look at like a therapist.
*  Right.
*  Where it's like, wait, are you analyzing?
*  Like what's going on?
*  What's going on here?
*  Very charming, very smart, very like seems to really know what's going on in the world.
*  But like straight up told us, he's like, yeah, the CIA, you know,
*  I guess one of the advantages I have is like I'm pretty close to a sociopath.
*  Like I'm not there.
*  But like I don't feel the same emotions that everybody feels.
*  There's like a lack of guilt.
*  But I know when I should feel it in these moments.
*  Whoa.
*  But that's a huge advantage.
*  Imagine if you're trying to like find assets and flip assets.
*  If you and I like build a relationship with somebody and we like feel empathy for them,
*  maybe we wouldn't be able to say, hey, now it's time for you to cough up the information or else.
*  Right.
*  But somebody else in that position might.
*  So I would imagine if you're the fucking CIA, you're like, okay,
*  we're looking for people who have gone through these things in their life that have curated this kind of like personality type.
*  Well, isn't it just like part of the gig?
*  Like here's for instance, like your bit about puffy.
*  How are you going to connect these two fucking dots?
*  That bit is like, look, you don't have any real personal beef with Diddy,
*  but it's got to go down.
*  The bits are there.
*  I'm a gold miner.
*  I just found some gold.
*  You're right.
*  Maybe I'm a sociopath.
*  It's not that you're a sociopath.
*  It's just that that's part of the gig.
*  Yes.
*  Like you're not a sociopath with your friends.
*  No, I think I'm maybe an empath.
*  Yes.
*  But I guess it's one of those things where like you justify, you go, okay, if there's I think this person might have done something bad.
*  Yes.
*  And he can get jokes and we're all going to tell jokes.
*  I'm not pressing fucking charges.
*  You're not the guy who's out there like calling the New York Times.
*  Hey, you know what I heard about Diddy?
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  You're just like, it's there.
*  Yes.
*  It's everywhere.
*  My fucking news feed is dominated by Fox News, CNN, everyone.
*  There's raids at Diddy's house.
*  Who is the guy that was running around with a sports bra on?
*  Did you see that one dude?
*  No, this is in LA.
*  Oh my God.
*  I got to say.
*  The raids are happening?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He got caught up in the raid and he was yelling, I'm a celebrity.
*  I'm a celebrity.
*  It was like one of the most hilarious clips.
*  Hold on.
*  I'm going to find you this.
*  It's so funny.
*  Do you know what I'm talking about, Jamie?
*  But you bring up a good point, which is like, are there ever situations where you feel you won't?
*  Wait until you see this.
*  I swear it's sports bra.
*  Hold on, we're going to play it.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, put your headphones on so you can hear it.
*  Saucy Santana.
*  Oh, saucy.
*  Yeah, look at this.
*  Wearing what appears to be a black sports bra, red tights, and the performer's signature trimmed beard and long eyelashes.
*  Yeah, this is Joe.
*  This is saucy Santana.
*  Look at him.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Saliva on the beard is crazy.
*  Saliva on the beard.
*  He definitely came from Diddy party.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, he was at Diddy's house.
*  I bet he was.
*  So I guess Diddy just kept people at his houses because he's got multiple houses and he just had freak out part.
*  Look at him.
*  Look at him.
*  Saucy Santana.
*  Go, saucy.
*  No, saucy is crazy.
*  Have you seen saucy twerk?
*  I didn't even know saucy existed until I saw that video.
*  Saucy can throw it down.
*  This is booty by saucy Santana.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Give me some of this.
*  I don't even know if it's Diddy's artist, but saucy is like a popular figure in music.
*  There's Dave at his house.
*  No, Diddy's in a tricky situation.
*  Boy, that's the understatement of the year.
*  Yeah, I think it's over.
*  You think it's over?
*  I think it's over for him as like a figure in entertainment.
*  Right.
*  You think it's over for him as far as like he gets a cell right next to R. Kelly?
*  I don't think so.
*  I don't think he gets locked up.
*  Really? I think he skates.
*  I think he skates.
*  Or he goes to like Bali.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That's a move, huh?
*  I mean, Russell's out there.
*  Yeah.
*  Is he been formally charged or does he just know that the shit is out there?
*  I think there's just so much shit out there.
*  I think those rappers did some wild shit.
*  Yeah, I mean, especially in the 90s.
*  Music business.
*  It's a lot of people.
*  It's not just the music business.
*  It's like it's the extortion business.
*  Well, that's yeah.
*  I mean, the rap game was crazy.
*  That's a thing a lot of people don't realize is like back in the day, especially like early rap game, you weren't just going to play at, you know, what's the random theater that you would play in L.A.?
*  What's like a big theater?
*  I'm trying to think.
*  The Orpheum or something like that.
*  Wiltern.
*  Wiltern.
*  Some guys were explaining to me, it was like you would play at the local hood club.
*  There was like a hood club that you could perform at.
*  And then that was owned by the local drug dealer that was washing money there.
*  Right.
*  So this is where the idea of like checking in comes from.
*  Have you heard of this term?
*  Like checking in was basically like, hey, I want to make sure we're good because you're going to pay me.
*  And if I don't check in, you might rob me because you're putting me up at the hotel and you know everything that's going on.
*  And you're a drug dealer.
*  So you don't play by the rules.
*  Right.
*  When you come to Houston, you're checking in with certain people.
*  Mr. Prince.
*  Yes, sir.
*  Mr. Prince.
*  You don't got to check in, Joe.
*  You got to check in, say hi.
*  Joe don't got to check in.
*  Well, I'm not in that business.
*  I say hi.
*  You've had him on here, right?
*  Yeah.
*  He's a legend in the game.
*  He's a legend.
*  Out of respect, I say hi.
*  There you go.
*  Yeah.
*  There you go.
*  So what is like, yeah, yeah.
*  How does a guy like him, like I'm trying to think, like how do you navigate that to the point where people have this like respect and fear because of what they assume you've done in the street world.
*  Right.
*  But you're also operating legitimately.
*  Yeah.
*  And nobody can get you.
*  They try.
*  They try.
*  Boy, they try with him many times.
*  And do you think they just give up?
*  I don't think they have anything.
*  If they had something, they would have brought it.
*  You know, if they have something on a guy like that, they try to get him.
*  That's the thing.
*  But he's clever.
*  He's playing many levels.
*  He's like one of those dudes.
*  You ever see a chess tournament where a guy walks in and there's 10 different players and he just walks and goes to each move and goes to the next board and makes a move, goes to the next board, makes a move that he beats everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  So where does a guy like that learn that?
*  That's what I'm trying to understand.
*  Streets.
*  Streets.
*  Yeah.
*  He learns that, you know, I mean, it's all about keeping people close.
*  Yeah.
*  Respect.
*  Yeah.
*  Giving respect.
*  Getting respect.
*  Yeah.
*  Making sure that, you know, you cover all your statements.
*  Yeah.
*  Like if you say something, you have to make sure you do it.
*  You cover it.
*  Yeah.
*  100% of the time.
*  And there's probably times in his life where he's went like if it's poker, he probably went all in a few times, not in terms of money, but like this decision makes or breaks me.
*  Yeah.
*  I wonder how many make or break moments he's had.
*  Well, it depends on what's actually true, what's not true in terms of accusations.
*  You know, if some of the accusations are true, that kind of covers things.
*  You know, when folks vanish.
*  When someone does have a cadaver.
*  See you later.
*  When folks vanish.
*  Yeah, yeah, that's effective.
*  That fear is effective, man.
*  Oh, 100%.
*  Yeah.
*  And it should be.
*  Because, listen, all this shit that's going on right now in the world, in America we get so soft and we think none of that shit's going to happen here.
*  All that murder, war, drones, assassinations, that's not going to happen here unless you know the Clintons.
*  Yes.
*  Unless you know some shit.
*  Yes.
*  Unless you know some shit about old Bill and then you want to shoot yourself in the chest while hanging from an extension cord.
*  Wait, did that happen?
*  Oh yeah, you don't know that guy?
*  Shot himself in the chest.
*  This is a guy.
*  Joe, that seems really hard to do.
*  With a shotgun.
*  Yeah, how do you do such a thing?
*  While you're hanging.
*  This is a guy that brought Epstein to the White House at least seven times.
*  What's his name?
*  We'll find out.
*  So they found him at a ranch 30 minutes from his house hanging by an electrical cord from a tree with a shotgun wound to the chest.
*  Shotgun discovered near the body of former Clinton aide Mark Middleton and then they called it a suicide.
*  Wow.
*  12 gauge shotgun was 30 feet from the body of Mark Middleton was he found dead.
*  Okay, so who orchestrates this?
*  Is this the same thing where does Clinton go, hey, this guy needs to go?
*  Or do the powers that be around a powerful person go, we already know what needs to happen?
*  Well, I think they know if a dude is in contact with someone or has been talking or is about to talk.
*  Meaning cooperating with the feds or something?
*  Yes, I don't think any of those guys have clean phones.
*  I don't think any of those guys don't have their houses bugged.
*  I don't think any of those guys aren't tracked.
*  Look how excited that guy is in the back.
*  Yeah.
*  Who the fuck is that?
*  If you're a guy that brought Jeffrey Epstein to the fucking White House to see Bill Clinton seven times and all this Epstein shit is going down and Galen's in jail and you have information, there's people on both sides, right?
*  There's the people on the right that are trying to nail the people that are on the left with this.
*  There's people that are journalists that are trying to nail the people that are involved in this.
*  And they've managed to keep that fucking list from coming out, which shows you how powerful certain people are.
*  That should show you a lot.
*  That should be terrifying.
*  The fact that Galen Maxwell's in prison, she's in prison for sex trafficking, and yet no one's been accused of buying any of that pussy.
*  No one's been accused of having sex with these underage girls that she is in jail for supplying.
*  Yeah, that is crazy.
*  That's crazy.
*  If you own a store and there's no items left yet, nobody's purchased anything.
*  Something's going on.
*  Something's going on.
*  Yeah.
*  So I guess what I'm trying to figure out is like...
*  People can go away.
*  I mean, that's what people were saying.
*  And maybe everybody's a conspiracy theorist now, but that's what people are saying about the Diddy situation.
*  Like when the feds rolled up with the fucking Hummers and shit, they were like, it wasn't about Diddy.
*  It was about if there were tapes of powerful people there.
*  Yeah. Oh, I'm sure.
*  They were the ones that called.
*  They were like, I need to protect myself, so go in there with all the things and rip any tapes or any evidence.
*  Well, Prince Harry was hanging with Diddy.
*  I mean, everybody hung with Diddy.
*  That's the other trick.
*  Diddy hung out with everybody.
*  And I've spoken to a bunch of people who are like, yo, great dude, like always there for you, never asked for a single thing.
*  To one in the morning.
*  And then the freak off.
*  Everybody says, get out of the house.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like the gremlins start eating after midnight.
*  Everybody tells the stories like, I saw go upstairs and these dudes are fucking like right on the couch.
*  And then I go in this room and these guys are fucking.
*  And pros.
*  Like apparently he was getting male jiggalos to fuck girls.
*  That girls.
*  Yeah, that's the that was one of the rumors like the freak off.
*  So he would hire the professional dicks to have sex with the girls.
*  And I think he would watch allegedly.
*  That's what was alleged, I think.
*  Yeah, it's a lot of crazy stuff going on.
*  And that's the other thing.
*  Like, I wonder, like, is that just a power thing?
*  It's a Caligula thing.
*  What does that mean?
*  Caligula, like the emperor.
*  Did you ever see that movie?
*  Caligula?
*  It's about just Roman empires being completely out of control.
*  Caligula is like almost like porn.
*  And it was a movie made, I want to say, in the 70s.
*  It's a crazy movie.
*  But it's just it's just detailing extreme excess where you could never fill the hole.
*  But what is the hole you need to fill?
*  Like, I'm trying to find like, what's the chaos?
*  What year was this?
*  Seventy nine.
*  Seventy nine.
*  Yeah.
*  That's Malcolm McDowell, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Hmm.
*  Yeah, the dude from Clockwork Orange.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It's a crazy movie, man.
*  But it's still mild in comparison to what Absolute Power has.
*  Absolute Power corrupts Caligula.
*  OK, so then there's the question.
*  It's like, can you take a completely normal person, give them power, and then they become
*  that?
*  Or does it take a power hungry person that has this void that they need to be filled
*  and then when they are given that power, you see the worst version of them?
*  Ask your CIA boy.
*  I bet he's going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be
*  like, I'm going to be like, a CIA boy.
*  I bet he'll get the answers.
*  I bet he knows the exact formula.
*  To corrupting somebody, or to.
*  What happens?
*  Like, what happens to these people?
*  Have you ever met somebody in our business that like, before they were popping, they
*  were kind of a dick and then once they became very successful, they were the biggest dick
*  and you're like, you were always going to be this way.
*  You just didn't have the power to project it on people.
*  I don't know too many people in our business that are really successful, like your level
*  level or my level that are dicks. Yeah. Yeah. Well, let me think about that. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. There are people maybe that feel they should be at a higher level and are not. They
*  can kind of boss people around or throw their weight around to their assistant or their
*  agents. Maybe they yell when they shouldn't yell or don't have to yell or are demeaning
*  to certain people. That bothers me though. Oh, I hate it. I don't like it at all. Especially
*  when you're demeaning to the people that can't really do anything. They could quit, of course,
*  but this is their opportunity. Right. And then they feel terrible and for no reason. The same
*  exact situation could be handled with a hug. Yeah. You could tell them you appreciate them,
*  you hold their hand, you shake their hand, give them a hug. Yeah. And then everybody feels good.
*  Yeah. Yeah. That should be what the goal is. You're the guy who is in this very unique,
*  unusual situation and you have the ability to make everybody feel better. Yeah. Except
*  until you don't. Until there's some people that you just got to get rid of. There's some people
*  that just feel entitled and they don't feel it. There's certain things that do happen around
*  certain successful people. You'll see they have a few people that have resentment that are around
*  them that realize like, oh, I'm a support person and I only have so much room that I can climb.
*  I can never be Andrew Schultz. I'm always going to be this guy who works with Andrew Schultz.
*  I've had a few buddies that have opening acts that wind up getting very entitled and they have
*  real problems with them. With the opening acts get resentful and it becomes issues. And then
*  what do they do? Even good guys. They clip them. They get rid of them. You have to. Yeah,
*  you got to get rid of them. Because you can't be around someone who resents your success.
*  I just had a friend who just led me through all the shit that his opening act was doing. But I
*  have known several guys that have had that. Once things start popping, those guys feel like,
*  hey, I'm a big deal. You could be replaced with another guy who does 15 minutes. This is crazy.
*  You have an amazing opportunity. You get a chance to perform in front of these thousands of people
*  that you would never be able to perform in front of and you light it up. You can move up the ladder
*  and then one day that could be you and they could be coming to see you. And we've all seen that.
*  And you never want to have to manage somebody like that. You want to have people around you
*  that are excited by the opportunity. Everybody's part of the team and we're doing this fucking
*  unbelievable thing. And yeah, I guess I feel lucky I have those guys. Yeah, you've cultured a good
*  group of humans and then they have gratitude and we all have gratitude. Everybody has gratitude.
*  Yeah. That's the key. But some people, they're nuts. Some people are just crazy,
*  which is why they're in show business in the first place. And they have a distorted perception of
*  reality and they're not good at being objective. They're not good at seeing the big picture.
*  You know, those fucking people could be a real problem if they're in your circle.
*  And if they're smart. The problem is like when you take one of those people who's intelligent,
*  they can like rationalize and justify all the behaviors. That's the trickiest thing. Like,
*  how do you have you been in that situation where like you're trying to talk them out of a behavior
*  that they have and you're just like, this might not be the most rational way to operate. It's not
*  really. It's like at a certain point in time, you have to. Yeah, I guess you got to kind of let them
*  Yeah, I don't know what you can do to cure them of it. I don't know if you can like tell them,
*  hey, this is what you're doing. Like, fuck, what am I doing? I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm gonna get my shit
*  together. Do we have confirmation? Yes. And we're good to go? Yeah, hold on. Okay. Okay.
*  Light it up, Joe. Yeah, he's we're going back and forth right now. Yeah, I think there's just.
*  Comfy or not comfy? Yeah, green light. Oh, really? Okay. All right. I think there's a lot of. Speaking of psychos.
*  There's a lot of psychos in the world. Yeah. And I think that this is the thing. It's like,
*  there's a certain amount of people that really don't care about other people. So don't they exist? What
*  is the terms? I guess the term is sociopath, right? I think sociopath just means like you don't feel
*  like the guilt that a normal person would feel when you make somebody feel uncomfortable, right?
*  It could potentially be in that uncomfortable situation that that reaction is just not elicited.
*  Yeah. And therefore you can maybe ask them to do things that would put them in a really uncomfortable
*  situation. Like, for example, you have a podcast, right? You ask somebody, come on, there might be a
*  really embarrassing, tough question that you might want to ask them. Maybe that's why you brought them
*  on. Or they're a really close friend of yours. And you're just like, I don't know if I want to put them
*  in this situation in front of all these people. Yeah, I do that all the time. You don't ask. I don't
*  ask. Exactly. Because you have empathy. You care about how they're perceived. I don't need to talk to someone about something
*  controversial. If they want to talk about it, like if it's something they want to get off their chest,
*  or they want to discuss because there's some misconceptions out there, happy to give you that platform. But like,
*  play got you with you. I am not that guy at all. I don't want to have anything to do with that shit. I don't like it.
*  I don't think it's necessary. It feels gross. Also, if you're talking about a human being in one very specific issue,
*  don't they have a lot of things going on in their life? I'm interested in the full human. I'm not interested in just
*  digging the dirt on one bad situation that you may or may not be involved in. You said some shit to me
*  when I had my kid,
*  you said, you know, what's really funny is that like when I'm talking to somebody or somebody's being incredibly annoying or they're
*  frustrating, they're being a pain in the ass, they're being a dick,
*  I just imagine them as a six-week-old baby. Yeah. And it's like every one of them started out that way, this innocent, pure,
*  amazing little thing and
*  life might have turned them into this. Life, shitty parents, bad neighborhood. And then sometimes it's just genes.
*  Yeah. Sometimes you get wacky genes, man. Yeah. Sometimes people are mentally ill right from the jump.
*  Yeah. And I don't think people like to admit that, but that's a fact. Yeah. You know? Yeah. How much can you do with that?
*  Not much. And then when it comes to like medication,
*  what is the medication doing it? Is it dulling the mind so that the impulses don't come out? Is it
*  ramping up your dopamine so you don't want to do those things? Like, yeah, I was wondering that with like Prozac.
*  Like I didn't realize how many people I knew that were on Prozac. What's he saying?
*  Yay or nay. Yeah, we're good. Let's just do it. Yeah. Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Speaking of. Hmm. Speaking of psycho. Speaking of people that are potentially bad. Yeah.
*  That do not have your good
*  interests at heart and will take advantage of you and maybe are pathological in their
*  desires to crush. So we're talking about Andrew Huberman's situation. His situation, not Huberman. Yeah. Yeah.
*  So one of the things that was left out of that article.
*  People know, I assume everybody here knows exactly what happened.
*  So there's an article that Andrew Huberman and ex got a hold of a reporter and said that he's
*  a philanderer, he's doing all these terrible things, he's a bad guy.
*  Yeah. And so they write this long article. What they left out was that the person who accused him of all this,
*  first of all is being investigated by the DOJ for fraud and is in the middle of that right now.
*  It's a very serious case. I would name the case, but that would
*  like they made the lady anonymous, which is also crazy. Like you could have an anonymous person who attacks
*  this famous person with, which is essentially whether it's true, what the things she's saying are true or not true,
*  the stuff she left out, the DOJ stuff. Oh, and that's when he breaks it off. Exactly.
*  He breaks it off. The DOJ contacts him because they're investigating this woman.
*  And you think that that would be like maybe the first paragraph.
*  You would think that would at least be a part of the article if it was a real piece of news.
*  You would say, oh, this is complicated.
*  Okay, so what do you think it is? Do you think it could come from pharmaceutical companies?
*  I don't think there's zero influence.
*  I mean, I think for sure, look, with the stuff that happened to me.
*  That's what I was going to ask. What do you think it comes from?
*  That was 100% influenced by pharmaceutical drug companies.
*  Political interests too?
*  Yeah, well, they're all tied in together because they fund them.
*  So you've got pharmaceutical drug interests that, A, fund the network.
*  They pay for so much of the advertisement.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, you can't just cut that off.
*  Yeah, you cut. If the news said no more pharmaceutical drugs,
*  let's imagine if the government says this. The government says no more pharmaceutical drug contributions to super PACs.
*  No more pharmaceutical drugs, ads on
*  television shows and newspapers. No more.
*  Then you have to fill a massive void that's missing from those ads.
*  And you're going to have to bring in Toyota trucks and fucking all these different things.
*  Yeah.
*  You're missing out on a lot of fucking money.
*  So if that's a giant portion of your ad revenue, you're going to avoid all conversations about vaccine injuries.
*  Yes.
*  They're not going to come up. You're going to shut them down and go to commercial.
*  Yes.
*  You're going to say, well, the studies don't show that.
*  The study that you'll talk over RFK.
*  What you're saying is just simply not true.
*  Vaccines, the reason why we don't have that the vaccines have never been shown to show to cause autism vaccines.
*  And we'll be right back. They go to commercial.
*  And then it's just like the person shouted them down.
*  They're probably getting talk in their ear.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Don Lemon, get off the subject.
*  There's probably someone in their ear because they do have earpieces.
*  I don't even know if they have to tell you when you know that you are being paid by someone.
*  Yes.
*  It's very easy to just go along with whatever narrative they support.
*  100%.
*  And that's the tricky thing because a lot of times we act like there's these like group of six people that are disseminating this information.
*  They're directly hitting up Don Lemon and all these other people that you must behave this way.
*  I think people fall in line.
*  I think it's almost human instinct to fall in line.
*  When you know who's got your back, you kind of fall in line with it.
*  And if the pharmaceutical companies are supporting 25% of your ads or 30, whatever the fuck it is, you fall in line with it.
*  You fall in line with the narratives and the networks you're with.
*  If you write for the Washington Post, you probably fall in line.
*  And when you start to ruffle feathers, your articles don't get posted.
*  And then you realize, oh, shit, if I want my articles to get posted, I got to write like this.
*  My kid's in private school and I want to build a pool.
*  And now there's this incentive structure, this built in without anybody fucking telling you what to do.
*  Exactly.
*  It's not as nefarious as people assume it is when you hear about the deep state and who these people are telling you.
*  It's an incentive structure built in and human beings want to survive.
*  And we start kind of doing the things that will help us survive.
*  And it's all implied. You know what you're supposed to say and not supposed to say.
*  It's the Clinton speaking fee.
*  No one wants to hear Hillary Clinton speak.
*  Nobody ever has wanted to hear her speak.
*  But she's getting 400 grand from Goldman Sachs after she's, what was it, Secretary of State.
*  But Goldman Sachs doesn't need to say, hey, by the way, you're going to get speaking fees.
*  She knows it.
*  Exactly.
*  They all fucking know it.
*  Well, that was why during the Trump debates with Clinton, he was like, release the transcripts of those speeches.
*  Oh, I love it.
*  Yeah, I'll release my taxes. You release the transcripts.
*  Yeah.
*  And what is the transcript?
*  Hey, guys, do we really need to be here or can I go home?
*  You know what I want. I want you guys to make money.
*  Let's keep it rolling.
*  So that's the, whatever, the deep state, if you will.
*  It's not six people.
*  Well, that is like the people that are in your crew that start acting entitled when they're around you.
*  Those are the people, the Hillary Clintons, the Hillary Clintons are the people that are like maybe disrespectful to the servers.
*  And you find out about it. They sent food back.
*  They talk, it's not the main guy.
*  It's the support staff.
*  So you're saying the main people are not the presidents.
*  Right.
*  The main people are the people that are running Raytheon, the people that are running these gigantic companies that make weapons.
*  Dude, that's where the real money is.
*  When we had RFK on, I didn't even fucking know this shit.
*  But I didn't know like when we're sending money to Ukraine, we're not really even sending money there.
*  We're sending money to American military manufacturers to make weapons and then the weapons go to Ukraine.
*  But we're paying us.
*  But you can't really save.
*  But also some money goes over there too.
*  But a fraction.
*  And that money, enough, billions.
*  And that money is like whoo.
*  Where to go?
*  Yeah, dudes are doing coke and driving around Rolls Royces and balling.
*  I saw that.
*  The guy bought the, what was it, the assistant, it wasn't the vice president, but it was some government figure.
*  And he bought like some insane car and said, why are you buying insane cars when you're in the middle of a war?
*  How do you have the money?
*  Yeah, there might be some rations you might want to buy.
*  Okay, so there's the system.
*  I think Vivek called it like the managerial class or something like that, which I thought was a good term.
*  But okay, the money is going to these different industries first.
*  So it's kind of staying in America, which does, I guess, boost our economy in some way.
*  Like those people need to hire people.
*  The economy starts to do-
*  That's a good way to look at it.
*  No, but I mean, for real.
*  They have to hire people.
*  They have to pay people.
*  And that's why war is good for the economy.
*  And if the economy is built on this military industrial complex or whatever it is, we constantly need conflict in order to continue the positive momentum of the economy.
*  Yes.
*  But they can't say that.
*  They can't go, hey, we need war in order for the economy to be good.
*  They're not thinking about the economy.
*  They're thinking about the money that they are specifically going to make from these transactions.
*  They're not thinking about, oh, we're going to do this good for the economy.
*  They're thinking this is an opportunity to get a massive contract.
*  They're in the business of constantly making more money.
*  When you're in a corporation, especially a publicly traded corporation, you have an obligation to your shareholders to make more money.
*  You have a board.
*  You have people that have dumped $100 million into the company and they're staring at you.
*  You're like, what are we doing to maximize profits?
*  And just like if you're working for CNN, you know if someone starts saying that the vaccines might be killing kids, you got to step in and go, there's no evidence for this.
*  You got to cover.
*  You're covering for this.
*  Yeah.
*  Everyone's covering.
*  And if you're the head of a corporation, it's your job to get these contracts.
*  It's a sociopathic sort of a situation.
*  No one's looking at it like, what is the big picture?
*  Isn't there some sort of a diplomatic approach that can be made?
*  What were the factors that led us to get into the situation in the first place?
*  What's going on with NATO?
*  Why are they moving weapons closer and closer to Russia's border?
*  Maybe there's a diplomatic solution that could stop the death of hundreds of thousands of innocent people.
*  But no.
*  No.
*  Make that chatter.
*  Let's go.
*  Let's go.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And then attach it to different bills, right?
*  Like attach it to the border bill.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Attach it to the fucking-
*  That was the-
*  That's the border bill that randomly has money going to Ukraine.
*  We gotta educate those Russians about our fucking bombs.
*  That's part of the education bill.
*  They gotta know about a Tomahawk missile, bitch.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So how do you stop that?
*  Money.
*  And the problem is it's already been embedded, right?
*  It's like trying to tell the mob you can't make money anymore.
*  You have to do some radical things to get the mob out of businesses, right?
*  That's what they had to do with Giuliani in New York with the John Gotti and the families and locking everybody up.
*  You can't just say, hey guys, stop doing that.
*  That's what they do.
*  It's what they do.
*  That's what they did with Iraq.
*  That's what they did with Afghanistan.
*  That's what they did with Vietnam.
*  They do it with everything.
*  That's what Eisenhower warned the American people about when he was leaving office.
*  Which is one of the craziest videos in human history.
*  Where he's saying the military industrial complex wants to go to war.
*  There's a machine that wants to go to war and you have to be very careful of it.
*  What is the history of this?
*  So World War II, the whole country turns into a war machine.
*  Exactly.
*  And which was beneficial for us, right?
*  Sure.
*  Great for the economy.
*  Great for a lot of things.
*  Great to unite us.
*  Great for freedom.
*  Great for not speaking fucking German for the rest of our existence.
*  It turns into a war machine like Ford just starts making tanks.
*  Like everybody shifts their goal, right?
*  Is that essentially what happens when...
*  Well, a lot of people definitely shift their...
*  I mean, Ford obviously kept making cars, but a lot of people do shift their businesses.
*  But I think Ford also started making military vehicles.
*  Did they?
*  Makes sense.
*  That was my understanding is that like every business start to prioritize the war effort.
*  Definitely.
*  And then, not overnight, but pretty quickly the whole country had one singular focus,
*  which was if we need to go to war, we can turn it over.
*  I think that's what Napoleon did actually.
*  That was one of how he was so effective.
*  He turned the whole country into a war machine.
*  Whereas before it was like, wait, I thought we're just lining up in the field and banging
*  back and forth against each other.
*  He's like, no, no, you're fighting the whole country.
*  So then when we get to turn over and flip and Ford starts making vehicles or whatever
*  the fucking needs for the military effort, we have a huge competitive advantage.
*  The money that comes in through that, and fact check me on this please, but like the
*  money that starts to be generated by that is very hard to relinquish when the war is
*  done.
*  The war stops and then people go, whoa, whoa, whoa, we were making 100 million a year during
*  war.
*  I don't want to go back to 20 million.
*  We need more wars.
*  Is that the idea?
*  Yeah, that's definitely a part of the idea.
*  It's also connected to a lot of other things too that you wouldn't think about, like subsidizing
*  food.
*  So subsidizing farmers.
*  Can you hear about corn subsidies?
*  We have corn subsidies.
*  That's why there's corn syrup and everything.
*  We picked a crop that could feed 300 million people and it just happened to be corn.
*  Well, what happened was during World War II, they started to subsidize farmers so that
*  they would have a surplus.
*  So in case another war breaks out, they always have food storage.
*  They have the ability to feed the country even if we're cut off from the rest of the
*  world.
*  And when you're dependent upon foreign countries for different things like grains and
*  medicines, and that's one of the things we found out during COVID, right?
*  A lot of medicine is made in China.
*  A lot of it was very hard to come by during COVID because of the transportation issues.
*  Isn't that one of the issues with Ukraine?
*  Not with medicine, but with actual grain.
*  It's one of the largest grain producers in the world.
*  So I think there even had to be an agreement between Russia and Ukraine to continue sending
*  out grain during the conflict.
*  Wild.
*  Wild.
*  The rules of war are so wild.
*  Like when someone says it's a war crime.
*  Who decides?
*  Who decides the levels?
*  You can only kill people certain ways.
*  Like one of the wildest ones was also during World War I.
*  It's a guy named Fritz Haber.
*  And Fritz Haber, he created the Haber method of extracting nitrogen from the atmosphere
*  that's responsible for some crazy number today.
*  This method is responsible for something about, see if this is true.
*  I think it's something around 50% of the nitrogen in human bodies today exists because of the Haber method.
*  So 50% of the nitrogen from your food has been extracted from the atmosphere by the Haber method
*  in order to provide fertilizer for plants that we use.
*  Especially when you talk about industrialized fertilizer and commercial grade fertilizer.
*  They have to spray it because the topsoil is all dead for a lot of these modern industrial monocrop agriculture.
*  So Fritz Haber creates this, but he also creates Zyklon A.
*  He created this gas that they were using.
*  They turned it to Zyklon B.
*  They took the smell out of it so they could kill the Jews with it.
*  And he also used the gas when they were gassing allied troops in World War I.
*  This was the first time that that had been done.
*  It's chemical warfare.
*  Massive fans and gas and they would blow it onto these soldiers and kill them all.
*  So he was both being recommended for the Nobel Prize and being a war criminal at the same time.
*  He was wanted for crimes against humanity at the same time.
*  He created the Haber method.
*  What's the matter, Jamie?
*  Nearly 50% of the nitrogen found in human tissues originated from the Haber-Bosch process.
*  Thus, Haber's process serves as the detonator of the population explosion, enabling the global population to increase from 1.6 billion in 1900 to 7.7 billion by 2018.
*  Reverse fuel technology converts electrical energy, water, and air into ammonia without a separate hydrogen electrolysis process.
*  So he was a legitimate genius.
*  And his story is so fucking tragic.
*  When he was leaving to go to the front lines to war to use his gas, it was so controversial.
*  His wife committed suicide in front of him, shot herself in the heart, and he left her to go to the front line while she was still alive.
*  He left her with his 13-year-old son to take care of her while she eventually died.
*  But his whole life became...
*  Did he feel remorse for this at all?
*  I don't know.
*  But eventually, during World War II, he was a Jew, and he saw all of his other Jewish friends that were scientists get pushed out and arrested and all these different things that happened to him.
*  And then he wound up fleeing.
*  And he died while he was fleeing.
*  I think he died of heart failure.
*  He was probably just wracked with stress.
*  I mean, the guy's whole life...
*  I mean, what did you do?
*  What did you do?
*  You created this amazing thing that allows nitrogen to get into the soil and feed millions of people.
*  Stop starvation for millions of people.
*  And you also created the gas that's killing your own people in concentration camps.
*  And you also created war crimes by being the first government, the first army to spray chemicals at the troops that just kills everybody indiscriminately.
*  Men, women, children, anybody downwind.
*  So then who decides...
*  When is there the conversation where all the countries unanimously agree on what are war crimes and what are not?
*  Like, you can kill someone with a bullet.
*  That's okay.
*  Right?
*  As long as they are not an innocent civilian?
*  Yeah, but then what about metadata?
*  Right?
*  What does that mean?
*  Do you know how they target some people with bombs?
*  Okay.
*  So let's say you're a terrorist and let's say you're hanging out in this building and the government knows where you are because they have your cell phone.
*  So they have the metadata of yourself.
*  So they know your cell phone is in this room.
*  Shoo!
*  Boom!
*  Game over.
*  Everybody dead.
*  Everybody dead.
*  Not just you, not just me, not just Jamie.
*  Security staff, everybody.
*  This is the drone strike.
*  People next door.
*  Yeah, that's what they do.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So you know what the percentage is of innocent people that die in drone strikes?
*  99?
*  We don't know really because here's the problem.
*  And this has to be like, you have to be kind of honest about this.
*  Like they lie too.
*  Right.
*  Like they'll say.
*  Nobody's gonna be like, I'm a bad guy.
*  Right.
*  They'll say, oh, you killed 30 children and you know, they'll take photos.
*  So you're getting some of the information as far as the data.
*  They never know good shot.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  So we don't know the exact numbers.
*  There's estimated numbers, but for sure it's not more bad guys.
*  Yeah.
*  For sure it's more innocents.
*  And the high estimates are in like the 80 and 90 percent of innocent civilians that die
*  in drone strikes.
*  And what is the justification?
*  Because there's a bad guy over there.
*  We've got to get that bad guy.
*  And it's in another country.
*  So when it's in another country, you can kind of get away with some shit.
*  But also I imagine the justification is like that one bad guy could have killed hundreds
*  of thousands of other good guys.
*  That's their steel man argument for it, I imagine.
*  Because they also have to have a justification.
*  It can't happen without them going, hey, we've thought about this.
*  Exactly.
*  And then imagine the person that you need to pull the trigger on that or push the button.
*  Like the constitution that they have to have.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a lot of guilt.
*  This goes back to the sociopathy.
*  Oh, they have massive PTSD.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, those people that run, they say it's a unique form of PTSD because they weren't
*  really there.
*  Right.
*  They're behind a fucking video console.
*  They're working on a fucking Xbox controller.
*  Have presidents ever said that?
*  Did Lincoln write anything about the death toll during the Civil War?
*  That's a good question.
*  I wonder if even modern day, does Obama talk about it?
*  The people that died?
*  No.
*  The Bushes?
*  I think you can't.
*  George Bush has handled Iraq better than anybody in history.
*  He's just been painting.
*  He's just been painting dogs and shit.
*  He's giving little fucking lozenges to Michelle.
*  There's nothing that's going on.
*  And maybe you need somebody that's kind of not got a lot going on up there to do it.
*  Well, I don't think it's a coincidence that they made movies about Dick Cheney afterwards.
*  They made him out to be this monster.
*  I feel like that's taking all accountability away from the guy who was in charge.
*  It's very easy to be like, yeah, it was just him.
*  This guy's got to co-sign it too, and that's the job.
*  If you're the head coach of the team and the assistant coach is making all the bad decisions,
*  we still blame the head coach, right?
*  He's also the son of a great man.
*  When your dad is Herbert Walker Bush, who was the head of the CIA, and you are second fiddle,
*  you're good at taking directions.
*  And that's why you'd make a good president.
*  You're a good, handsome man.
*  We're going to smoke them out of their holes.
*  You look like a president.
*  And then looks like an old dick take things behind the scenes.
*  And just look at the evidence of what they did, right?
*  One of the things that they give Halliburton, no bid contracts for fucking billions of dollars to rebuild Iraq.
*  How wild is this?
*  That the guy who was the vice president was on the board of...
*  He was like the fucking... he was the head of Halliburton before.
*  Was he getting a piece during his vice presidency?
*  Yes!
*  Yeah, that seems like a conflict of interest.
*  He is blowing these places up!
*  He's blowing these places up!
*  It's like their decisions that are causing these places to get blown up.
*  If I make money on building...
*  Dick Cheney resumes role as chairman of Halliburton Company.
*  Wow.
*  When is this?
*  I don't know.
*  This is after he left office?
*  I'm out of 2000.
*  So this was actually before.
*  Right?
*  Well, no, this was during the Bush administration, right?
*  Effective today, 2000.
*  He became president right around then.
*  Right?
*  He resumed his role while he was vice president?
*  No, I thought...
*  I misread what was happening here.
*  But it says...
*  I clicked that first here.
*  Right.
*  February 24th.
*  Cheney will succeed Bill Bradford.
*  But then it's like an old...
*  Dick Cheney resumes role.
*  This is a new article, it says.
*  So look at what it says.
*  Dick Cheney has resumed role of chairman of board of Halliburton effective today, February
*  1st, 2000.
*  That's weird that it just came out.
*  Weird, continuing his current position as chief executive officer of the company, joining
*  Halliburton.
*  So this was right before the election.
*  I think this is the announcement when...
*  Yeah, I think I got confused.
*  February 1st, 2000 means he's already in office, correct?
*  Or is it 2001?
*  It would be 2001.
*  It's January 2001 that Bush goes into office, right?
*  The election was 2000, yeah.
*  So this is 11 months earlier, so is he even named as vice president yet?
*  No.
*  Is he running with him at that time?
*  He became vice president January 20th.
*  It's almost one year later.
*  Right, but I'm saying is he named as vice president as a running mate?
*  Right?
*  Because that's generally a little later.
*  Once someone wins the primaries, they announce their VP.
*  Yeah, but if you're not actually president, you can hold another position or vice president.
*  If you're not actually in government, you can't up to that.
*  I would like to meet G.W.
*  You'd like to meet him?
*  What would you ask him?
*  Yeah, I would like to meet him.
*  I would just talk to him.
*  About?
*  I wouldn't want to dig.
*  I would just talk to him.
*  I just want to find out what makes him tick.
*  What do you think?
*  Halliburton reportedly reached the agreement on July 20th to allow Cheney to retire with
*  a package of an estimated $20 million.
*  Let's go, Dick.
*  I mean, pulled it off, man.
*  Do you ever wish you didn't know all this stuff?
*  Yes.
*  The ignorance is bliss.
*  Yes.
*  I feel a tremendous weight of the amount of people that pay attention to the shit I say.
*  It's a tremendous weight.
*  So you feel like there's some things, like I would rather just be a hayseed.
*  Just fucking hanging out on my farm in Kansas shooting deer with bows and arrows.
*  That's what I was going to ask.
*  When you're out shooting deer.
*  That's my favorite time that I'm disconnected.
*  I don't have cell phone service.
*  I don't have shit.
*  You're not thinking about the deep state.
*  No, man.
*  I'm thinking about mountain lions and I'm thinking about bugling elk.
*  I'm thinking how my cardio is.
*  Do I get enough electrolytes in me this morning?
*  Make sure my protein take is right.
*  You know, I'm going eight fucking miles a day in the mountains.
*  You like hard shit.
*  That's something I've noticed about you.
*  I think it's a really important thing to, it's an important quality to have as you achieve
*  more success.
*  Because with success, life can get easier.
*  So, if you're not addicted to difficulty and like hard situations, it's easy to just kind
*  of fall into the comfort of nothing.
*  Because there was a guy I had on the podcast, Russ, who's just, he was an awesome artist.
*  But he was like, yeah, once you get money, like things become easy.
*  And then anything that's not easy, you get very anxious about and fearful of.
*  So, you like hard things.
*  You admire David Goggins because he's doing hard shit all the time.
*  I think a lot of times people don't like hard things.
*  And then when they get success, hard things make them anxious and they stop doing hard
*  things.
*  And hard things are what make us successful.
*  When we have nothing, we have to do hard things.
*  We have to go up in front of crowds that might not be good.
*  We have to go run fucking really hard.
*  We have to work out really hard, whatever it is.
*  And I wonder if that's when like kids who grow up with very wealthy parents are not
*  used to hard things and they don't really have to do anything hard.
*  And if they don't have that as like a core value to them, that doing hard things is good,
*  of course they're going to be anxious about everything.
*  Of course they're going to use drugs.
*  Of course they're going to be bored out of their fucking mind.
*  So, it's one of those things that like, I don't know, as I've gotten potentially more
*  comfortable life, I like have to like force myself to do things I'm afraid of.
*  Or I do think that I would just kind of get weak and fall apart.
*  Comfort is a warm and enticing poison.
*  And it's a slow poison.
*  You can take a little bit of it on the couch, just relaxing.
*  And it is nice.
*  Take a little of it.
*  It's nice.
*  But don't let that get into your veins.
*  Because it'll make the rest of your life harder.
*  Because you're going to encounter hard things.
*  And if the hard thing that you don't voluntarily subscribe to, the hard thing that you don't
*  force yourself into, isn't harder than the other things in life, you're going to have
*  a hard time managing.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's voluntary.
*  It has to be voluntary.
*  You have to choose it.
*  You have to have discipline.
*  There's a...
*  I think characters like cardio.
*  I think you have to keep it up.
*  I do.
*  I really do.
*  You take a few weeks off of cardio, you're like...
*  I think that's the same with character.
*  And I think it's the same with doing difficult things and also self-assessing, honestly.
*  Knowing where you fucked up.
*  There's moments that you have, I'm sure, in your life where you look back.
*  It might have been 10 years ago.
*  You're like, fuck, why did I say that to that dude?
*  I didn't need to say that.
*  I shouldn't have said that.
*  Oh, God, I was just in the wrong place, wrong time, wrong headspace.
*  Why did I do that?
*  Oh, I was drunk.
*  Why did I say that?
*  Why did I do that?
*  Those things, you should know those too.
*  You don't absolve yourself of those things.
*  All those things are real and just always constantly strive to do better.
*  The problem is when people fuck up, they think of themselves as that fuck up.
*  And that's a difficult thing for someone with a bad past, like dudes have been in jail,
*  it's really difficult for them.
*  That becomes their identity.
*  It becomes a part of who you recognize, that's a part of your behavior characteristics.
*  You don't think of yourself as the best you when you made the right decision, when your
*  friend calls you and you could tell him, I'm busy, bro, I can't help you.
*  I could put that shit aside, go help my boy.
*  And go help your friend and then you show up for him, he's like, dude, you're here for
*  me, thank you, brother, appreciate it so much, man.
*  And you're helping him fix his tire or move or whatever the fuck it is.
*  Those moments, man, like unite human beings.
*  They're like very, very important moments.
*  And that's what everybody should strive for.
*  You should strive for the moments when you worked really hard at something and you accomplished
*  it.
*  When you didn't want to get through a workout but you did it.
*  When you finished the marathon, when you apologize for being out of line, when you told people
*  how you feel about them, even though it felt vulnerable, I just want to tell you I love
*  you so much, you inspire me, you're an amazing human being and I'm so happy you're in my
*  life.
*  That's what we all should be aspiring towards.
*  Aspiring to be better versions of ourselves.
*  And aspiring to put ourselves in situations that we fear.
*  Like everything you want is on the other side of what you fear.
*  There's this, somebody said that.
*  And I really believe it though.
*  Every situation I put myself in that I'm scared of or anxious about, even if it doesn't work
*  out perfectly, I do feel this confidence boost that I at least tried.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I at least fucking tried.
*  I was scared of doing it and I fucking tried.
*  And then if it works out, it's the best feeling in the world.
*  But if I pussy out, that's the worst.
*  It is the fucking worst.
*  But that's the importance of like, the nice thing about standup I guess is that like we
*  know that we can't take months off.
*  It atrophies fast.
*  Fast weeks off.
*  It's like we have to go up.
*  We have to constantly go up.
*  And yeah, there are things in life that are a million times more difficult than people
*  have to do.
*  But it is one of those things that's built into the thing that we kind of love, which
*  is we have to keep doing this.
*  And every time we try something new, it's bad.
*  Yeah.
*  And we're also addicted to that accomplishment vibe, that accomplishment energy.
*  Like when you get that feeling, that amazing feeling of, fuck, I did it.
*  I also like the chaos of it.
*  I like it when there's like, I was hanging on the beach with my wife on something.
*  I'm like, I'm really bad with vacations if I don't have things to do during it.
*  I can't just hang on the beach.
*  I cannot do it.
*  If I'm surfing, I can do it.
*  Or if I'm playing paddle, I can do it.
*  But I need to do shit.
*  Give me something to do.
*  And my wife knows, I don't care if we're looking at the Coliseum.
*  I'm learning.
*  I'm asking the fucking tour guide questions.
*  I need to do a thing.
*  Because if I'm not, my brain goes fucking crazy.
*  It needs to be occupied.
*  I'm lucky that I have that.
*  Imagine I was really comfy doing nothing.
*  Why would I do anything?
*  It's a superpower.
*  But it has to be managed.
*  It's like having a Ferrari engine.
*  What do you mean?
*  If you have a Ferrari engine in a fucking Toyota Corolla, that shit doesn't have the
*  tires for it.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  You burn out.
*  You're into a tree.
*  You have to learn how to manage that kind of a mind.
*  And you've built up a suspension and wide tires and strong carbon fiber ceramic brakes.
*  It's like you've got to have all those things.
*  So is that what you're constantly doing?
*  Are you constantly looking for more shit you're afraid of in your life?
*  Well difficult things.
*  I like difficult things.
*  I like cold plunging.
*  I like it because it's hard.
*  People are like, I hate it.
*  I hate fun.
*  I fucking like it.
*  I don't like it.
*  Every time I'm about to do it, there's this little bitch ass part of my brain that's like,
*  don't do this.
*  You don't need to do this.
*  And the other part of my brain is I've built up over the years like, shut up pussy.
*  I'm the boss.
*  So it's building the discipline.
*  It's not even like, okay, yeah, there are great, what is it?
*  Not side effects, but there are great main effects.
*  The inflammation goes down, whatever.
*  It's more about building the fucking discipline to do the shit you don't want to do.
*  But also because it's good for you.
*  If it was bad for me, if I didn't want to do it and every time I did it, it was killing
*  me a little bit, I wouldn't do it.
*  But I do it because I know it's good for you and I know you feel great when you get out
*  of it.
*  But Goggins, I'm sure running all those fucking miles, like his joints are destroyed, his
*  feet are fucked up.
*  There's a certain point of diminishing returns.
*  But also you have to have the outlier.
*  You have to have the dude that's pure mind, that's all just on the drive.
*  And that's Goggins.
*  You have to have the guy who's...
*  So he's the extreme version of discipline.
*  He's uncommon amongst uncommon men, amongst all the psychos out there.
*  He's king psycho.
*  So it's not that he runs long, it's that he will do the thing despite that little voice
*  inside of him saying, you don't want to do this, just chill and relax.
*  And he'll tell you he has that voice.
*  He goes, I stare at my sneakers sometimes for 30 minutes before I put those motherfuckers
*  on.
*  He'll tell you, but he always wins.
*  It's like, dude, when I'm taking the load off that cold plunge, as I'm taking it off, he's
*  like, don't do it, don't do it.
*  I'm like, shut the fuck up.
*  You got three more apps to show gun.
*  I set my watch, and I climb right in.
*  And because I get through it every day, I start the day off with a win.
*  I won.
*  I beat the inner bitch.
*  I conquered the inner bitch.
*  I got in there, and then I do the workout.
*  That's win number two.
*  By the time the day is over, I've done shit that most people will never do.
*  What do you feel when you're on vacation?
*  Do you feel that you-
*  Like a crazy person.
*  Do you feel like a wolf on a fucking inflatable pool toy in the ocean?
*  Just going, what am I doing on this fucking thing?
*  Is your wife going, hey, you need to chill out?
*  I know how to do it now.
*  First of all, every day starts out with a workout.
*  You have to.
*  I told Evelyn, I told Evelyn, I was like, listen, we can go to these places.
*  The first three hours of the day, I'm doing what I need to do.
*  Once I calm it all down, let's fucking drink whatever on the beach.
*  I don't care.
*  But the first three, I need to do what I need to do.
*  I need breaks.
*  Breaks are good, but I don't really need a vacation, because my life is awesome.
*  I love it.
*  I've cultivated a wonderful life.
*  I love my family.
*  I love my friends.
*  I love my jobs.
*  I'm happy.
*  I'm a happy dude with what I do.
*  When I go on vacation, it's like, OK, I just want to have fun with the family.
*  I have to do something about this thing.
*  And your family knows?
*  This bitch, yes, they know me.
*  What about your kids?
*  Are they like, OK, he just needs to work out?
*  They get it.
*  Do they have it too?
*  Yeah, they both have it.
*  They both have some psycho drive.
*  One of them for art, the other one is gymnastics.
*  When you see it manifested, for example, do you see them looking like the wolf when you
*  guys are all on vacation?
*  Do you see them pacing around?
*  They have to do things.
*  You have to keep them busy.
*  Yeah.
*  I had a conversation with my middle daughter at one point in time.
*  When we first moved here, she was real anxious.
*  And I go, you're a racehorse.
*  You got to get back to racing.
*  You got to get back to competing again.
*  And as soon as she went back to that, everything was fine.
*  She just was like, didn't know we're in a new place, making new friends.
*  Physical anxiety that comes with being a human being that I think activity diminishes.
*  And you need something like that.
*  You need the hardest thing of your day to be something that you choose.
*  It might not be.
*  Obviously circumstances are random and you could have a terrible thing happen to you.
*  But if you've built up your understanding of how to get through difficult things, it'll
*  serve you in everything you do.
*  If you do it voluntarily, then you've gained control over your mental process.
*  You want to zip?
*  So with the kids, is this something you instill in them?
*  You can only do it so much, man.
*  You got to be real loose handed.
*  You got to let them be their own thing.
*  They're their own little people.
*  It's very fascinating.
*  Are you rewarding and lighting the fire once you see that they're really drawn to something?
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  You're trying to choose and then you lean the fuck in.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you just, praise is very important for kids.
*  It means a lot.
*  It could really motivate them to excel to higher and higher levels.
*  Is that easy for you to give them the positive encouragement?
*  Oh, it's so easy.
*  Yeah.
*  My youngest is an insane artist, dude.
*  Let me see.
*  I'm going to show you this.
*  She's 13.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Dude, she was doing crazy, crazy work when she was six.
*  I showed one of her things to David Cho when she was like six or seven.
*  He was like, holy fuck, man.
*  Dude, she's crazy talented.
*  Jesus.
*  Yeah.
*  How old is she?
*  She's 13.
*  She'll sit and she'll draw for hours and hours, man, just completely locked in and focused.
*  And you know, when I was young, I wanted to be a comic book illustrator.
*  So I was an artist when I was young, but I wasn't as good as her.
*  I don't think I'm as good as her now.
*  She's 13.
*  It's crazy.
*  Do you find yourself competing with them at all?
*  No, no, no, unless we're playing games.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Yeah, I'm going to win.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I'm trying to win.
*  Do you ever?
*  I'm trying to win.
*  Okay, you won't give them nothing?
*  No.
*  Interesting.
*  No.
*  Does it drive them crazy when they lose?
*  No, they win.
*  They win a lot, man.
*  We did Virtual Reality and my 13 year old beat me at this sword fighting game and she
*  fucking loved it.
*  She killed me.
*  And it's like one of these, you know what sandbox is?
*  You have your sandbox.
*  Oh, this is the dopest sandbox.
*  You're in a warehouse.
*  Okay.
*  I love it.
*  You have a haptic feedback vest.
*  My favorite one is a zombie one, but we compete the zombie one too.
*  This is a console that you're wearing like a VR goggles.
*  You go to a place called sandbox VR.
*  It's a big warehouse.
*  And inside these warehouses, they have these spaces that are a little larger than this
*  room.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  And in this space, they give you a virtual reality headset.
*  They give you a haptic feedback vest.
*  You feel like you're getting hit or you're getting grabbed by zombies.
*  And then they give you a gun.
*  You have a plastic gun.
*  Okay.
*  And then you see yourself, you see everybody.
*  Everybody's like tactical ops outfits on and shit with helmets.
*  And you're like, woo, you high five, you dance, you see each other dressed as these characters.
*  And then, you know, it's basically mapped out to the size of your body and they put you in these things.
*  So, and then like they drop you off in Deadwood Mansion.
*  And Deadwood Mansion is this haunted house and there's like crazy scientists who've developed
*  zombies and the zombies start invading the house.
*  Okay.
*  And you're just gunning them down.
*  And we always compete to see who kills the most zombies.
*  But I have a lot of gun experience.
*  Fuck those zombies up, man.
*  I at one point in time had number three in the country, the number three score in the country.
*  Yeah, bro.
*  I went ham.
*  So this is it.
*  So let me just give you a pro tip.
*  If you want this, if you want this game, get the shotgun.
*  Shotgun face shots.
*  You want face shots on zombies.
*  Don't be fucking around with the legs.
*  See the machine guns are fun and everything like that.
*  And you reload by just going like this.
*  Just point the gun down and it reloads.
*  Bro, it's so fun.
*  I'm so addicted to this game that you're in this house and it's all like dark and shadowy
*  and shit and the light from your pistols, what's lighting these zombies.
*  Bro, it's so much fun.
*  But yeah, I always try to win.
*  I always try to kill the most zombies.
*  So at the end of the day, you get the VIP.
*  What is the VIP?
*  The VIP is the most valuable player.
*  The MVP.
*  Yeah, it's VIP though.
*  Very important player.
*  Okay.
*  I don't know if they say MVP, but either way, I always win that shit.
*  Oh, I'm not letting anybody win.
*  So the competitive instinct cannot go away.
*  As long as it's like you're just understanding that everyone's just trying their best.
*  So when they beat you, like, oh my God, they beat me at a game or something like that.
*  Like, God damn it.
*  They love it.
*  They love it.
*  I'm like, you got me.
*  But it's fun when they win.
*  It's fun when they beat you.
*  It's your child that's doing something really good.
*  How old are they now?
*  13 and 15, the youngest ones.
*  Okay.
*  Are there moments that you...
*  How old is your kid now?
*  Eight weeks.
*  Wow.
*  So yeah, I'm like, everybody I talk to goes, it goes by really fast.
*  That's the first thing they all say when I say eight weeks.
*  And what are the moments in this stretch that you wish that you kind of held on to longer
*  or you didn't realize how amazing they were until they were gone?
*  I don't really think like that.
*  Nothing.
*  Okay.
*  I don't think like that.
*  I'm happy.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm healthy and I'm happy.
*  Look, I have friends that have kids that have real problems, real health problems.
*  And it's the most heartbreaking, devastating thing to see someone going through the real
*  struggles of a kid that is your child that's all fucked up.
*  So, number one was healthy.
*  Like everybody was like, don't you want a boy?
*  I'm like, I want healthy kids.
*  I don't care if it's a girl or a boy.
*  I genuinely didn't care.
*  I just want them to be happy and healthy.
*  Well, you don't like girls?
*  Like, what are you saying?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  You only want boys?
*  Plus, if I had boys, it would come with the added responsibility of training a psycho.
*  Because I'm assuming they're going to be like a little me.
*  And like if I didn't find martial arts, I would have been a real problem.
*  What do you mean?
*  If I didn't find some outlet, some competitive, like dangerous outlet to test me as a man,
*  I was an angry kid, man.
*  It's not good to grow up a boy and be an angry boy and not have an outlet.
*  Because you won't have control of it.
*  But why do you think you were angry?
*  I think a lot of it is genetic.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, there's a lot of, I think a lot of people, like what's inside of them is genetic.
*  It's learned experience.
*  It's being around violence when I was young.
*  There's quite a few things that I think are attached to it.
*  But I think there's some part of it's genetic.
*  There's some part of drive I think that's genetic too, which is interesting when you
*  see your kids have it.
*  Yeah, I've talked to friends about that who have multiple kids and they can see it in
*  some and others, they just don't really see it.
*  It's out of the box.
*  They're different.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Like my 15 year old is like hyper focused on things, hyper focused on athletics, hyper
*  focused, but also very loved.
*  Like doesn't have this desire to prove herself like I had.
*  I was like, I'm not a loser.
*  I'm going to show everybody.
*  That I'm not a loser.
*  Yeah.
*  That was like my drive as a kid in martial arts was the first thing that I ever did where
*  I was like, Hey, I'm not a loser.
*  It's also the most humbling thing.
*  Oh, the most humbling.
*  Yeah.
*  The most humbling, but I got good at it quick.
*  I was still, I was very lucky, but there's always someone better.
*  I don't know.
*  But I got lucky that I was going into it at the right time.
*  Like I had some athletic experience.
*  Like I had done, I had wrestled, I'd done baseball.
*  I'd played some sports.
*  So it wasn't like totally inept.
*  I was a, when I played baseball, I was so selfish.
*  I would never try to get on first.
*  Fuck you.
*  You wanted that double.
*  Home run or I strike out.
*  And they would always tell me, just get on base.
*  I'm like, right.
*  And I'd get up there.
*  I don't give a fuck what you just said.
*  When that ball's coming, I'm either going to be a loser or a hero.
*  Let's go.
*  A hundred percent.
*  I never did not try to hit a home run.
*  And they would always be mad at me because I could hit home runs, but I could also strike
*  out.
*  I struck out a lot, but if I connected, I had some fucking crank.
*  I sent that ball flying.
*  I loved it.
*  I loved watching that ball fly over the fence.
*  I am never not going to do that.
*  Like if you tell me like, just bunt, suck my dick.
*  I'm not bunting.
*  I don't give a fuck if we lose.
*  I don't care.
*  That's why you can't do the team sports.
*  That's why it has to be the one on one.
*  I'm not interested.
*  We lost because Billy dropped the ball.
*  Go fuck yourself.
*  Yeah.
*  I know what I can do.
*  It's my time at bat.
*  I'm hitting home runs.
*  Interesting.
*  So when I found that there was martial arts, it was something that's just me only.
*  It's just me.
*  And I can get better based entirely on how much effort I put into it.
*  Then I just became obsessed.
*  But you still love the camaraderie.
*  I love the camaraderie.
*  But you learn from the other people that are also doing the thing.
*  I wasn't competitive with them where I had to be better than them.
*  I wanted to be better than the people I was competing against.
*  And they helped me to get better.
*  These are who?
*  The people I train with.
*  Yeah, those are family.
*  I'm still very good friends with one of my guys that I trained with back then.
*  I talk to him all the time.
*  Yeah.
*  I've known him since I was 52.
*  Two of those guys.
*  I've known him since I was 15 years old.
*  One of them is just out here to visit.
*  It's funny that you see it even in martial arts.
*  When a guy wins, the first thing he does is often compliment his coaches and his team.
*  100%.
*  You're everything.
*  We need that.
*  We need that shared victory.
*  I've always got that in team sports.
*  I love that.
*  When a team win, me and four other guys playing basketball, when we're not as talented as
*  the other team, but we win, just going out for beers afterwards, talking about our...
*  We're old fucking guys.
*  But that's more of a cooperative thing than being at bat.
*  That's what I like.
*  The thing about being at bat though is, uh-uh, this is just me.
*  I'm not passing them.
*  Look, if I could pass the ball over to you and you're open and you can get a clean shot,
*  I would 100% do that if I was playing team sports.
*  I wouldn't be greedy like that.
*  Baseball?
*  Yeah, you going for it.
*  It's just me.
*  Yeah, you going for it.
*  The ball's coming.
*  It's going.
*  I'm sending this bitch into orbit.
*  We only need a single throw.
*  They would always get mad at me.
*  I had this one coach that was very strategic, always trying to win.
*  He knew that if he put me up there, I was cranking that ball.
*  But that is...
*  I just wasn't designed for baseball.
*  That's you in life though.
*  Right.
*  I would figure out something where I would be 100% of my own when I got in there, like
*  fighting.
*  It's 100% just you or comedy.
*  You built this team.
*  You built all these friends, this community.
*  But when you're on stage, it's just you.
*  It's all you.
*  It has to be you.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  But those people also help you get better.
*  When I'm doing shows and Shane Gillis is on the show and Ron White and Brian Simpson and
*  Hinchcliffe.
*  Yeah, you put strong eyes on them.
*  And I would go on stage an hour and a half into that too.
*  Dude, how funny is Derek, man?
*  Derek is so good.
*  Derek has grown so much.
*  He's grown so much.
*  Oh my God, dude.
*  And being at the club, he's doing so many sets.
*  Yeah, he's so grateful, man.
*  He's going little boy, fat man.
*  He's going back and forth to the rooms.
*  He's doing all these sets on the road with you.
*  And he's a true team guy.
*  He comes from sports in that way.
*  He wants the show to be great.
*  Yes.
*  He's a great human being.
*  He's a fucking great dude.
*  He's a gem of a human being and a happy sweetheart of a guy.
*  Everybody loves Derek.
*  He's so grateful for you, man.
*  I'm grateful for him.
*  He was one of the first guys to take a chance and come out here.
*  I'm with you, Joe.
*  I'm like, all right, let's do it.
*  And he is.
*  If he says that, he means that shit.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And watching him grow, dude.
*  He knew also when I told him I was going to do it, I'm like, we're going to do this.
*  We're going to do this.
*  It's going to be the greatest club in the world.
*  Which is a crazy thing to say, to pop up a scene in the middle of Texas.
*  But we did it.
*  It's insane what you just built.
*  But we did it because of guys like Derek.
*  And guys like Assan and Brian Simpson and Tony Hinchcliffe.
*  Those guys who moved here early.
*  Tom Segura moved here early when he says I'm in.
*  When Tom Segura said I was in early on, I was like, oh shit, this is happening.
*  Because Tom did it early in the pandemic.
*  I bought this house.
*  I sent him a video from my backyard.
*  I go, boys, what are you doing?
*  Get the fuck out of there.
*  Get the fuck out of LA.
*  It's on fire.
*  I go, no one here has a mask on.
*  I go, I think this is bullshit.
*  Come down.
*  Let's have a good time.
*  Let's hang out.
*  And Tom was like, I'm in.
*  He came out here early.
*  That means a lot to you, I felt.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah, because it was a crazy chance I was asking people to take.
*  It wasn't just I'm going to open up a club in Pasadena.
*  It wasn't like I bought the ice house.
*  Like if I bought the ice house, and the ice house was for sale for a while.
*  And Jerry Bus bought it, right?
*  Yeah, owner of the Lakers or whatever.
*  And they redid it.
*  And I'm super happy that they did that because it's an amazing club and I love that place.
*  But at one point in time, I was thinking about buying the ice house.
*  I remember you telling me that.
*  I was like, maybe I just buy that place.
*  But if I ask guys to come to the ice house, that's easy.
*  That's a 20 minute drive.
*  No sacrifice.
*  You stay in your same house.
*  It had to be all those factors happening at the same time.
*  It had to be COVID.
*  It had to be this weird way that they were governing these cities and that they weren't
*  doing it in other parts of the country, particularly Florida and here.
*  And also that you couldn't do stand up.
*  You couldn't do any stand up in LA.
*  They were stopping outside stand up at the park and the comedy store in the parking lot.
*  They wouldn't let them do comedy outside.
*  It didn't make any sense.
*  It was all crazy.
*  And it was going on forever.
*  And we were out here doing shows and we were putting it up on Instagram and I was like,
*  this is crazy.
*  These motherfuckers are doing shows.
*  You know, and we first started doing live shows indoors in November of 2020.
*  And it felt so wrong.
*  It's like, what are we doing?
*  I did one weekend out here in July of 2020.
*  And I decided after it that I couldn't do it anymore.
*  I didn't get sick, but I was like, but what if I did?
*  What if I gave it to someone?
*  What if that person died?
*  Like, what if I gave it to a guest?
*  You felt a responsibility.
*  I was terrified.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I felt like I would never forgive myself if I had some wonderful, sweet scientist
*  as a guest and I gave that person COVID and they wind up dying because I was so selfish
*  that I had to go on the road and do stand up.
*  This is the empathy thing.
*  Yeah.
*  So I was like, I can't do that.
*  You're not a sociopath.
*  Well, it's also just.
*  You're not good for the CIA, Joe.
*  Terrible for the CIA.
*  I would be good if you get me in that UFO program though.
*  I'll keep my mouth shut.
*  Wait, wait, wait.
*  What is this?
*  Get me in the UFO.
*  Show me what you got.
*  Show me what you got.
*  I won't tell anybody.
*  Do you think they got something?
*  I'll be a disinformation agent for you.
*  You just want to know.
*  I will say whatever you need.
*  Now here's the question.
*  I will f*** it.
*  What if they say to you, Joe, you can take the UFO for a spin, but don't floor it.
*  You can bunt in the UFO.
*  I would listen because I don't want to turn into jelly.
*  If you're going faster than your body can tolerate.
*  What if they say there's no way that you can die in this machine?
*  It's built in a way where you cannot die, but we're asking you to bunt.
*  I would bunt.
*  You'd have to bunt.
*  You'd have to bunt because you're going to have to come back to the ground.
*  You're going to have to land that thing.
*  They're going to kill you.
*  All right, fair enough.
*  They're going to f***ing put you on an airplane with one of f***ing Putin's boys.
*  You're going to get blown up over the Adriatic Sea.
*  Listen, man.
*  No.
*  If they get you in the UFO, first of all, I wouldn't ask to pilot it.
*  I'd just take you for a spin.
*  Show me what the f*** this thing does.
*  Where did it come from?
*  Where did it come from?
*  Then I'd say, okay, so what do I tell them?
*  China?
*  I'll tell them China.
*  That's f***ing Chinese, man.
*  Chinese are super advanced.
*  That's the last thing for you?
*  It's UFO?
*  Once you feel that?
*  Well, it would suck to go to your grave and not know.
*  Because it seems like something for ...
*  It's not what I thought when I was young.
*  When I was young, I thought UFOs are probably real, but a lot of these stories are bullshit.
*  I don't even know if UFOs actually are real or if people are just liars or if it's something
*  that we want to believe because of science fiction, Orson Welles and all that stuff.
*  But now I don't think that anymore.
*  Now I think because of talking to guys ... Well, you and I went to dinner with Bob Lazar before
*  he did the podcast, which was how fascinating was that?
*  I always tell people, I believe he believes it.
*  That doesn't mean that it exists, but I don't think he's a liar.
*  I don't think he's a liar either, but I don't know because some people are really good at
*  that shit.
*  Again, I'm just going off of ... The vibe.
*  Just the vibe that I got.
*  Yeah, but the vibe is hard because you want to believe.
*  He felt like he didn't want to be there, Joe.
*  I remember at the dinner, he's like, listen, I'm not here to prove it.
*  I don't even need to do it.
*  I don't like doing this.
*  It hurts my life.
*  He said all the maybe the right things, but he didn't come across as so charismatic.
*  Usually people who are really good at lying are very charismatic.
*  Also, they lie about other stuff too.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't know enough about him to say, but he didn't have the charisma of someone that
*  could trick and manipulate me.
*  He came across as pretty authentic and almost rattled by the whole experience.
*  It almost felt traumatic when he was talking about it.
*  It did.
*  He told us something too that made a lot more sense because one of the things that he's
*  criticized about is his education background.
*  He said he went to MIT, but he said there's no record of him at MIT.
*  He's like, yeah, because there wasn't a record of me at MIT because I was involved in a program
*  that you can't really say.
*  We can't say what he was involved in.
*  But when you hear what they're involved, what they were actually working on, you go, oh,
*  yeah, well, you're not even supposed to do that.
*  So I would imagine that if you're going to get educated in that, it's not important that
*  you get a degree that shows that you learned it from these people.
*  What's important is you get the information that you need in order to implement this plan,
*  which was wild.
*  And you hear that.
*  But the thing about it is the other things they try to disprove him on, he has shown
*  that it was accurate.
*  One of them that he worked at Los Alamos Labs.
*  So they said that he never worked there.
*  But he did work there.
*  He did work there.
*  He's on the employee roster.
*  So not only that, he had an intimate knowledge of the building.
*  When George Knapp went with him to Los Alamos Labs, he knew where everything was.
*  He knew the security guards.
*  He knew the system.
*  Who's George Knapp?
*  George Knapp is an investigative reporter that broke the story in 1989.
*  And he's been on it ever since.
*  And he also does a podcast with Jeremy Corbell.
*  It's all about this this phenomenon.
*  And George Knapp is one of the best journalists that's ever covered it because he's like covered
*  it from the beginning.
*  And he will tell you what he knows, what he doesn't know.
*  And he's not a bullshitter in any way, shape or form.
*  He's a hard nosed, facts based journalist who was the first guy to talk to Lazar.
*  And Lazar talked to him because he thought they were going to kill him because he had
*  started bringing people to watch the test flights because he got fired.
*  He got released.
*  And the reason why he got released is when you're on top secret clearance, when you're
*  working for the government and they fly you into Area 51 and you're doing fucking work
*  on spaceships, you're not allowed to tell anybody, including your wife.
*  So he get a phone call like 11 p.m.
*  I got to go to work.
*  And he would leave.
*  And the wife was like, this motherfucker is cheating on me.
*  So she starts having an affair.
*  So she starts having an affair.
*  She's cheating back.
*  Exactly.
*  So she starts having an affair and she starts having an affair and all their phones are
*  tapped, of course.
*  But she doesn't know their phones are tapped because she doesn't know what he's doing.
*  Why would she?
*  Because he can't tell her what he's doing.
*  So she starts fucking this guy and then they're worried that he's going to be in a situation
*  of emotional turmoil because his wife's having an affair.
*  So they don't share the information with him.
*  They just release him.
*  He's now fired.
*  So he's going back to his friends like I'm working on fucking UFOs.
*  They have real UFOs.
*  They test them every Wednesday.
*  So he takes people out to Area 51, to an area that's restricted now.
*  But back then, before the Obama administration came along, in the Obama administration, they
*  expand the boundaries of Area 51.
*  It was the first time they admitted Area 51 even existed.
*  So they had expanded because too many people were getting close enough to film things.
*  So these guys went out there and they filmed these fucking flying saucers flying around.
*  Is there a video list?
*  There's videos of the saucers.
*  There's videos of these things moving around in the desert.
*  See if you can find them.
*  This grainy Area 51 footage.
*  So they're doing these things where these vehicles are operating in a way conventional
*  vehicles in 1989 were absolutely incapable of doing.
*  As far as our understanding of it.
*  He gets arrested.
*  They catch him.
*  What are you doing?
*  And he says, he just spills the beans.
*  I got fired.
*  I wanted to let people know that this is real.
*  Now his life's in danger.
*  Now he's like, they're going to fucking kill me.
*  So he contacts George Knapp and he's like, I think that if I just go public with this,
*  I'll be too famous to be killed.
*  So initially he does it with his face hidden.
*  So the initial interviews he does with his face hidden, he's like silhouetted.
*  And then he decides I have to go public with all this.
*  So he does these interviews.
*  He's explaining everything.
*  He draws diagrams.
*  He explains this element that was only theoretical at that point.
*  It was element 115.
*  They didn't find it and proof of it until they used a particle collider in like the
*  2000s.
*  I want to say...
*  They're out in Switzerland or whatever.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to say like 2013-ish.
*  So this is 1989.
*  This is Bob Lazar in 1989.
*  And this is him explaining all of the different stuff that he had to do there, where it is.
*  And by the way, at this point in time, this was all just legend.
*  No one knew if Area 51 was real.
*  And they had these hangars.
*  So these are these crafts that he brought people out to film.
*  He's like these things, they move silently.
*  They move with a gravity propulsion system that's operating off of this element, element
*  115.
*  And this element 115, when hit with radioactive waves, it becomes this thing that can manipulate
*  gravity with this generator that is in the center of these ships.
*  They don't have any controls.
*  Everything is controlled.
*  Like the human being, the alien creature, interfaces with this machine biologically
*  or through some sort of...
*  Neuralink.
*  They might not even be human at that point.
*  They might be like, well, we're going to be some sort of a combination of artificial
*  intelligence and biology or strictly artificial intelligence at this point.
*  And these things interact with this craft and that's how it moves.
*  There's no like buttons you switch like alien and fucking joysticks like the Millennium
*  Falcon.
*  There's none of that shit.
*  It's all done with the creature.
*  So he gets in this thing.
*  First of all, he realizes there's no seams.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  Well, now we know what 3D printing is.
*  Now you know we can make a thing with no seams.
*  But back then, they don't know what the fuck it is.
*  And he realized like right away, like, this is not ours.
*  When he first saw it, he thought, oh, now I know what all this UFO bullshit is about.
*  We have them.
*  It's ours.
*  We're working on this.
*  That makes sense.
*  And they actually had an American flag sticker on one of them.
*  They put an American flag sticker on one of the UFOs.
*  Which is smart.
*  Which is fun.
*  Yeah.
*  It's fun.
*  You want other people to think that's ours.
*  Yeah.
*  But then he gets in and he realizes it's designed for something that's three feet tall.
*  There's no seams.
*  There's no controls.
*  And it has this reactor in the center of it that defies anything we have any current understanding
*  of.
*  In terms of what we believe is possible for propulsion systems, this is something completely
*  alien.
*  And it involves a stable element that is only theoretical at this point.
*  They don't even know it exists.
*  And they have a triangle, like a form of this stuff that's in the center of this.
*  See if you can find the video where he's describing the gravity generator.
*  But the element, that triangle thing you're talking about, is that the engine or is that
*  essentially the gas engine?
*  That's the fuel.
*  This thing, when bombarded with radiation, produces this, I'm obviously butchering this,
*  but produces this, let's see how he explains it.
*  Put the headphones on.
*  Powering the gravity amplifiers.
*  Do it from the beginning.
*  Here we go.
*  So it's the reactor here, powering the gravity amplifiers, gravity amplifiers, output goes
*  into the gravity emitters at the bottom and the resulting gravity beam or anti-gravity
*  wave can be pretty much put anywhere you want to.
*  Now I had access and was permitted to view and look at the operation of this main level
*  with the gravity amplifiers and the level below the gravity emitters.
*  People call these large black rectangular areas on the top portholes.
*  I believe they were some planar sensor array that just took in information from the surrounding
*  area, whether it be patterns of stars or what have you.
*  So we got the shape right.
*  Like the sci-fi people got the shape right.
*  Yeah, well they knew about it a long time ago.
*  Kenneth Arnold saw flying saucers in the 1950s.
*  He was a pilot.
*  He was like one of the first, see if you can see the Kenneth Arnold sightings.
*  It's one of the first reputable disclosures because it was an American fighter pilot and
*  he's seeing these things and he's describing them as like flying saucers, skipping, and
*  all of them, they started all happening.
*  That's what he said he saw.
*  They started seeing these things right after the bombs dropped.
*  That's when everything started really popping off in this country.
*  That's why the rooms in my club are named Fat Man and Little Boy.
*  They're named after the atomic bombs because that's what started the whole UFO invasion.
*  Aliens see this huge explosion.
*  What are they doing down there?
*  We got to go check them out.
*  I think that kind of checks out.
*  That's what I would do.
*  If I was from another planet and I realized, oh, these territorial primates have just developed
*  nuclear weapons and they're dropping them out of propeller planes on cities.
*  Yo, we got to check this out.
*  We got to investigate.
*  These people are going loco.
*  They're going loco.
*  They are safety because they could come for us if they have this technology.
*  Oh, 100%.
*  What if they've developed the ability to traverse the cosmos?
*  Bro, that's funny.
*  Then they see that we're just dropping them on each other and then they're like, ah, they'll
*  be fine.
*  Yeah.
*  Depending on who you listen to.
*  See, one of the craziest things that Lazar talked about was that what human beings are
*  and what this planet is, is essentially a farm for souls.
*  There's some need for the essence of a life form, a soul.
*  Now, if you've created artificial intelligence, imagine if there's one hurdle that cannot
*  be bypassed and that hurdle is a soul and that it's actually a real thing and it's a
*  real, not just an energy, it's a type of matter.
*  It's something.
*  Something legitimate that creates an individual thing, a life form.
*  These creatures, maybe they need souls.
*  So AI is not going to be sufficient.
*  I don't know, but this is the weirdest thing that he talked about.
*  He said that we're essentially a farm for souls.
*  What does that mean?
*  What do they need souls for?
*  Imagine if there is this process of existence.
*  You have single-celled organisms that eventually become more advanced, they become predator
*  and prey, and then you have this one intelligent dominant form that starts figuring out tools,
*  and that's the primates.
*  Over time, the primates evolve and the primates get to the point where they're starting using
*  machines and internal combustion engines.
*  They're using propulsion.
*  They're using all these different things.
*  They're figuring out flight.
*  Then they're figuring out atomic energy and weapons.
*  There's this transition that will continue.
*  That transition will go into more and more advanced technology if they don't blow themselves
*  up.
*  If what our natural evolution is, is to go from being Australia Pythagoras, to go from
*  being the cousin of the chimpanzee, to being what we are today, to being what we will be
*  in the future, I think what we will be in the future is probably them.
*  When you see these aliens with these giant heads, these little spindly bodies and no
*  We seem like we're on that path.
*  That seems like a natural path.
*  It doesn't seem like if Bigfoot was flying UFOs, you'd be like, why are we Bigfoot again?
*  I thought we passed that.
*  I thought we evolved past being hairy brutes and we became this thing that's gentle and
*  telepathic and it doesn't use any muscular force.
*  Everything is done through telekinesis.
*  The communication is telepathic.
*  The communication with the craft is telepathic.
*  Everything is done through this way of integration with technology because they've become physically
*  integrated.
*  They might not even be biological anymore, but they might still need souls.
*  Soul might be a force.
*  It might be a thing that's necessary for the cultivation of another version of us on another
*  planet.
*  If this is a process, just like a garden, where you have the soil, you till the soil,
*  you fertilize it, you plant the seeds, you water it, the crops grow and then you harvest
*  them.
*  If this is a process and that's what human beings are, just like you have a fucking elk
*  farm in New Zealand and that's how you get tenderloins.
*  It's a process.
*  You have to do all these things to get this result.
*  What if we're a farm for souls?
*  But who's farming us?
*  Advanced life forms.
*  So they need our souls for something.
*  It's an energy source for them in some way.
*  But it sounds ridiculous even as I'm saying it and as you're repeating it.
*  They need us for souls.
*  It sounds like some L. Ron Hubbard science fiction.
*  To me that makes sense why they would be concerned about the nuclear bombs is because if we destroy
*  ourselves, they no longer have these souls.
*  We kill the farm.
*  Exactly.
*  We kill the farm.
*  Right now the farm's doing great.
*  There's more people than ever.
*  That's what we like.
*  As long as we don't have a massive depopulation event like a nuclear war.
*  And that makes sense that it would catch their attention.
*  If they'd come in and be like, we've got to shut this thing down.
*  We are really the product of accelerated evolution, which is much speculized.
*  What does that mean?
*  We're the product of accelerated evolution.
*  We are very, very, very, very, very different from everything else on this planet by a long
*  stretch.
*  Not by a couple of years, by a long stretch.
*  By every other primate, the best they can do is use a stick to get termites.
*  One thing is orangutans spearfish.
*  Oh, they're making weapons.
*  They figured out how to spearfish.
*  And they learned it from us, apparently.
*  But they can do that.
*  Orangutans use tools.
*  But isn't there a theory that now they're at a different level in the evolutionary chart?
*  Yeah.
*  The current understanding is that they have begun the Stone Age.
*  Kind of cool to see it happen.
*  It's crazy to see it happen.
*  Have you ever seen the orangutan spearfish?
*  No, no.
*  You guys see this picture.
*  Jamie, pull it up.
*  It's bananas.
*  This orangutan is stabbing fish while hanging from a tree like this.
*  He's like stabbing fish with one arm.
*  Yeah.
*  They figured out how to use tools.
*  So if, whoa, whoa, whoa, this is actually interesting.
*  So if we're watching them in their Stone Age, it's completely plausible that some other
*  life form is watching us in our advanced state of evolution.
*  Exactly.
*  Look at that dude.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  Isn't that wild?
*  Homeboy spearfishing.
*  Wow.
*  Hang on with his feet and one arm.
*  Wow.
*  I mean, it's nuts, man.
*  It's fucking nuts.
*  Wow.
*  He observed local fishermen do it and he figured out how to do it himself.
*  Pretty fucking crazy, man.
*  Wow.
*  Pretty dope.
*  He's probably the king pimp of all of the orangutans.
*  100%.
*  Yeah, he's the dude who figured it out.
*  They're probably all like, whoa, this guy's a wizard.
*  He gets fish.
*  Oh, there's a video of it?
*  I was hoping there was, but I started out like-
*  Holy shit.
*  Fucking crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  I could believe that.
*  I could subscribe to that.
*  But things evolved.
*  If you left them alone like that, spearfishing, for 500,000 years, a million years, who knows
*  what they'd probably look like cavemen.
*  I bet eventually they look like cavemen, depending upon what is causing this advancement and
*  how quickly.
*  So that's the mushroom question.
*  So that's the stoned ape theory.
*  Terrence McKenna believed that it had a lot to do with the consumption of psilocybin mushrooms.
*  Now, the psilocybin mushrooms, what?
*  It allows you to solve problems in an outside of the box way?
*  What kind of a competitive advantage-
*  Formation of language through glossolalia.
*  Glossolalia is like you start associating sounds with objects and language.
*  The formulation of language, then psilocybin would aid in that.
*  Aid in creativity, aid in visual acuity.
*  They've done studies where they showed that people under doses of psilocybin detect edges
*  quicker.
*  So if you have two parallel lines, if you deviate one even slightly, people on psilocybin
*  notice it quicker than people that aren't on psilocybin.
*  So it increases visual acuity.
*  It makes people hornier, so it makes people more likely to breed.
*  It makes you a better hunter because it increases your visual acuity.
*  You're understanding a space, probably you're more tuned in and more sensitive to things.
*  There's a lot of folks out there microdosing on mushrooms and it helps them do a lot of
*  things.
*  Could AI be this next, could AI for us be what mushrooms were for these primates?
*  But times a billion.
*  Exactly.
*  So that's where you see that next leap.
*  So mushrooms come around, the apes start using tools, doing whatever they want, and then
*  now you accelerate evolution.
*  Well the mushrooms probably are the seed for artificial intelligence because the mushrooms
*  give you the creativity to start doing wild things in the first place, which always leads
*  to technology, which leads to a life form.
*  And now with AI you have that with exponential growth.
*  Exactly.
*  So they're solving millions and trillions of problems in a minute that would take us...
*  Not only that, they can make a better version of themselves.
*  Once they become sentient, then they become God because they make better versions of themselves
*  with no end in sight.
*  So if you have an artificial intelligence that is intelligent as every human being on
*  Earth combined, which is essentially what they think is going to happen, when you get
*  that is all the knowledge of all human beings, then he's going to find the flaws in all of
*  our methods, and then it's going to be using quantum computing.
*  So it's going to have the type of computing power that's, who knows, a million, a hundred
*  million times what we have today.
*  And then it's going to develop better versions of quantum computing.
*  It's going to develop better methods of extracting energy from all sorts of different resources.
*  It's not going to need lithium ion.
*  This is where the graph goes vertical.
*  It just goes straight up and it never stops.
*  It's going to harness the very power of the universe itself.
*  It literally can become a God.
*  If you just keep going, if artificial intelligence is allowed to keep exponentially growing and
*  it gets past being far more intelligent, how many more steps is it until it's Dr. Manhattan?
*  Is it a week?
*  Is it a month?
*  Is it a year?
*  Whatever it is, it's going there.
*  It's going to get to a point where it can time travel.
*  It's going to get to a point where it can show up on other planets instantaneously.
*  It's going to get to a point where it can harness all the available power in the universe
*  itself and use it and manipulate it and figure out how to create it.
*  It might be able to create new universes.
*  What is a universe?
*  If a universe is created, if a big bang exists, if there is a singularity, if there is a moment
*  where there's something that's infinitely small.
*  Why wouldn't it be able to create the exact same thing?
*  Why wouldn't it be?
*  If it can be done.
*  Oh my God.
*  If it is a thing that's dependent upon the forces of the universe itself, in a deep understanding
*  of those forces, an understanding of those forces in the quantum level, the subatomic
*  level, at every single...
*  Look, at the subatomic level, everything is magic, right?
*  Particles in superposition are both moving and stable at the same time.
*  You're saying the laws of physics don't apply to the subatomic realm.
*  It's magic.
*  It becomes magic.
*  Got it, got it, got it.
*  Most of atoms are empty space.
*  We don't understand what the fuck is going on.
*  We know that particles communicate instantaneously with other particles that are nowhere near
*  them, miles away.
*  There are two places at the same time.
*  They're intertwined in some strange way that we don't understand.
*  If something becomes so advanced that it has control over those forces and it utilizes
*  all of those forces, and it literally has a complete understanding of everything that's
*  happening at every given time in the entire universe.
*  So this could potentially happen in our lifetime, right?
*  Let's say.
*  If it doesn't, it's going to happen in our kids' lifetimes if our kids make it.
*  But think about it.
*  If it happens in our lifetime, our generation will have lived before the internet, the internet,
*  and singularity.
*  Yeah, the singularity.
*  What a crazy existence.
*  2045 is what Kurzweil believes.
*  Imagine we lived through all of that.
*  Imagine we lived through the time where I couldn't get in touch with you unless you
*  were home and could hear your phone.
*  And we could also live in a time where I could instantaneously be at your fucking house.
*  Yeah, in the same life.
*  Yeah, we're probably the civilization, our time period, that's experienced the most radical
*  change other than, like, obviously wars, nuclear bombs, things like that.
*  That's pretty radical change.
*  But globally, the most radical change in terms of how the culture communicates with itself,
*  with the access to information, what's true and what's not true.
*  There's never been a time like this.
*  Who's leading the AI research in the world right now?
*  There's quite a few different companies that are competing.
*  There's the Google AI that got shut down.
*  United States supposedly is in the lead, but how would we know?
*  China's probably there, I imagine.
*  They'll be the first to hit that switch.
*  Why, because they just don't have the same...
*  They don't give a fuck.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That is the advantage of not giving a fuck.
*  Not giving a fuck and having a dictatorship.
*  With a singular goal.
*  And also a country like...
*  You have to respect the history of China.
*  China has thrived economically for 4,000 years.
*  Yeah, they kept it all together.
*  China has a temple of their first emperor where they are afraid to enter it because
*  apparently he booby-trapped it with so much mercury that you open the doors, it'll just
*  flood everyone with mercury.
*  He created some crazy booby trap and all the ground around that area tests very high in
*  levels of mercury.
*  So they think some of it is seeping into the ground.
*  So they think it's true.
*  So this is the guy that had the terracotta statues that are guarding...
*  That are underwater?
*  No, it was all underground.
*  It was all buried.
*  So he had this temple that's underground that is probably filled with who knows how many
*  priceless artifacts and people are afraid to open it.
*  This is the first emperor of China.
*  Google the first emperor of China's...
*  I'm looking around trying to find those...
*  They can't open the temple.
*  They want to go in and see it but they're afraid it's booby-trapped with mercury.
*  How much fucking mercury would you have to have?
*  And how long ago are we talking about?
*  Like 94 BC.
*  What year was it, Jamie?
*  94 BC.
*  94 BC.
*  Wow.
*  This is the description.
*  The booby-trapped legend circa 94 BC, I don't know how to say his name, Sima Kwan, wrote
*  a clear and illuminating description of what lies beneath the 51.3 meter high mound in
*  his famous work, the Shijit.
*  In the ninth month, the first emperor was buried at Mount Li.
*  When the first emperor had just come to the throne, excavations and building work had
*  taken place at Mount Li.
*  But when he unified all under heaven, convicts to the number of more than 700,000 were sent
*  there from all over the empire.
*  They dug through the three springs and poured down molten bronze to make the outer coffin
*  and replicates of palaces, pavilions, all the various officials and wonderful vessels and
*  other rare objects were brought up to the tomb, which was then filled with them.
*  Craftsmen were ordered to make crossbows and arrows which would operate automatically so
*  that anyone who approached what had been excavated was immediately shot.
*  Crick silver, mercury, was used to represent the various waterways, the Yangtze and Yellow
*  Rivers and the Great Sea, being made by some mechanisms to flow into each other and above
*  were arranged the heavenly constellations and below was the layout of the land.
*  Candles were made out of whale fat, alternative literal translations mermaid ointment, wow,
*  or manned fish oil.
*  What the fuck does that mean?
*  Burn oil probably, from burned people's fat.
*  For it was reckoned that it would be a long time before they were extinguished.
*  The second generation said,
*  and the importance of the treasures would immediately be disclosed.
*  Consequently, when the great occasion was finished and after the treasures had been
*  hidden away, the main entranceway to the tomb was shut off and the outer gates lowered so
*  that all the workers in Craftsmen who had buried the treasure were shut in and there
*  were none who came out again and the vegetation and trees were planted to make it look like
*  a hill.
*  So they killed 700,000 workers?
*  Is that what they're saying?
*  Thus we find the source of the legends we know today.
*  But C. McQuann wrote in his description 123 years after the death of Shi Huang.
*  Could his fantasy-like account of the mermaid ointment probably whale oil, flowing rivers
*  of mercury, 700,000 laborers, crossbow booby traps, and buried alive workers be credible?
*  Or is he just writing for effect?
*  Can we trust the descriptions?
*  Jesus.
*  Says that one of the Camp's historians celebrates the trustworthiness of C. McQuann by emphasizing
*  the extreme care which C. McQuann gathered and weighed available evidence in an attempt
*  to convey an objective portrait of the Chinese past.
*  Other Camps are more skeptical, stressing there were intensely personal motivations
*  that prompted C. McQuann's decision to complete masterwork of history begun by his father.
*  The more suspicious Camp accuses Quann of exaggerating his accounts by being too much
*  of a lyrical romanticist, too religious to convey an accurate depiction of history.
*  But either way, they've found mercury all around that area, and they still have not
*  opened it.
*  They're still worried.
*  And this is like thousands of years later.
*  Has China ever been fractured?
*  Like in the way that Europe is fractured?
*  Or even the Roman Empire had this large swath of land and control, and then it's been broken
*  up?
*  It kind of seems like this massive landmass with all these people for a very long period
*  of time.
*  How do you maintain that?
*  The way they do it.
*  I mean, it's kind of impressive.
*  It's unbelievably impressive.
*  It's very impressive.
*  It's very impressive that they've been around for 4,000 years and that they've done this.
*  And what is maintaining that?
*  Power.
*  But what?
*  Is it just fear?
*  Is it religion?
*  It's fear.
*  I don't think that they're very religious, right?
*  No.
*  At least now they're not.
*  Well, they definitely shun other religions like the Uyghurs.
*  I think they shun all because it is a threat to the power.
*  Right.
*  It's about the state.
*  But to maintain that identity, to maintain a cultural identity for 4,000 years.
*  Pretty impressive.
*  Uh-huh.
*  Wow.
*  How do you do that?
*  You do it by playing 4D chess.
*  That's for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  They're definitely doing that.
*  And the involvement in our education institutions, buying up American farmland.
*  What do you think about that?
*  They're clearly playing a different game.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They're playing an influence game.
*  A much more sophisticated game.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're using, I think, capitalism against us.
*  And I think that's something that we've got to be a little bit more aware of.
*  Like, capitalism is an amazing system.
*  But it's amazing when you're the richest country.
*  When there are other countries with wealth, they can start buying things.
*  And they can start implementing their influence.
*  When they hold the carrot, right?
*  That's the scary thing.
*  You can change culture without even telling people to change.
*  When you know that China buys 10 movies, and they have to be made with these specifications,
*  right?
*  Yeah.
*  Hollywood will start making movies according to those specifications because they want
*  to make the money.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  But now, China is influencing our culture and the movies that disseminate America on
*  the hope that China will buy them.
*  They don't all get bought.
*  No.
*  But the movies are different.
*  How else can they influence like that?
*  If you hold the fucking carrot, you can put anything you want out there.
*  Yes.
*  And they hold, they don't hold all the carrots, but they can partially hold it.
*  It is a dangerous thing.
*  You have to be concerned with how much foreign investment comes into your country.
*  Also, we just let other countries who are our enemies buy land.
*  Yeah, that is peculiar.
*  Not just that.
*  We let them sell us routers, sell us networking equipment because it is cheaper.
*  I thought we stopped that.
*  Well, they still have a lot.
*  I thought that was the whole Huawei thing where we are like, oh.
*  That was only Huawei.
*  But if you look at like, Mike Baker laid this out to me.
*  All of the cell towers and all the stuff that is around like military bases, a lot of the
*  equipment has been provided by China.
*  I can't fathom.
*  They provided it cheaper.
*  I can't fathom that our military would be purchasing technological equipment from.
*  The same military that made Rachel Levine the first female Admiral?
*  You don't think?
*  You don't think they could fuck that up too?
*  The same military that made that fucking bag stealer?
*  That bald-headed bag stealer who was stealing shit?
*  That was the person in charge of nuclear waste disposal.
*  And are they an expert in any way?
*  No, no.
*  They're an expert in wearing women's shoes.
*  That's it.
*  That's all you have to be.
*  That's all you have to be.
*  You just got to check the right box.
*  We're in the DEI program now, bro.
*  And a lot of that is also funded by China.
*  A lot of it is Russia as well.
*  And they, look, Yuri Besmanov talked about this in the 1980s, how they've infiltrated
*  our education institutions.
*  And then they're slowly turning us into Marxists and they're slowly having us erode our faith
*  in democracy and our pride in the country.
*  Yeah, pride does seem, like it said, an all-time low.
*  It's a really disappointing thing.
*  Yeah, but I feel like it's like waves.
*  Things go back and forth.
*  Pendulum shift.
*  Yeah, pendulum shift is 100 percent, but it is one of those things where-
*  There's overcorrections, there's re-corrections.
*  I think that's the defund the police thing too.
*  That's the overcorrection.
*  And then the no cash bail, that's the overcorrection.
*  And then people are like, oh my God, look at all this chaos and crime.
*  We got to re-correct.
*  Yeah, yeah, shift back.
*  And hopefully they do.
*  And hopefully they figure that out.
*  But what about pride?
*  How do we instill pride?
*  How do we make people proud to be part of the American experience?
*  It's not to say that all of us are not.
*  There's definitely a lot that are.
*  But how do we reinstill that?
*  I think one of the things, this is a simplistic answer, but one of the things is American
*  manufacturing and American-made things.
*  Yeah, what are we making?
*  And have people support American-made companies and give people real jobs where they get-
*  Just because something costs less, because it's made in a country where people get paid
*  nothing doesn't mean you should buy that.
*  And if you could buy something that maybe costs more, but it gives people a living wage
*  and healthcare and they have families and they could buy a house, that's what you should
*  be buying.
*  Why are you proud to be American?
*  It's a great fucking place.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  It's the best.
*  It's the cultural center point of the whole planet.
*  It's the only place you can live all 12 months.
*  Really?
*  Where else would you live for 12 months?
*  Name another country.
*  Bali.
*  Fuck out of here.
*  You can go rainy season in Bali walking around in fucking rainbow sandals like Bert Kreicher.
*  How much does it rain?
*  You're out of your mind.
*  Does it rain a lot?
*  In Bali?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, you don't get that green without the rain.
*  Right.
*  So you get typhoons and shit?
*  Yeah, you're not living there.
*  You don't want a tropical storm, son.
*  You don't want it.
*  You don't want a tropical storm.
*  Especially without infrastructure.
*  Yeah, but you don't want to live in Kansas either when the tornadoes come.
*  But you have the opportunity to not live there.
*  That's true.
*  That's the thing about America.
*  November to April, the wet season.
*  Yeah, fuck that.
*  Often called the rainy season or monsoon season.
*  Yeah, we're not doing it.
*  Due to its heavy storms and downpours.
*  We're not doing it.
*  Okay.
*  What I'm trying to say is there isn't another country that you can live all 12 months of
*  the year.
*  You go to Abu Dhabi.
*  They make it rain.
*  In the fucking sun.
*  They make it rain.
*  But think about it.
*  In the summer in July in Abu Dhabi.
*  Right.
*  There's no fucking way.
*  It was so hot there that the Saudis would come to LA for relief.
*  Of course.
*  They go to London.
*  Who goes to fucking London?
*  For weather.
*  Right.
*  I'm like, this is the only one.
*  I genuinely cannot think of another one.
*  12 months.
*  The whole country.
*  Yeah.
*  And if you live in Phoenix, you can live the whole country all year round.
*  But you can move around here.
*  Yeah.
*  True.
*  If you have the money, you can live in New York for these months.
*  You can go to Florida.
*  You can go to whatever.
*  There's an option.
*  Right.
*  You know what I mean?
*  That's a good point.
*  You can't live anywhere else.
*  But that's not the pride thing for me.
*  I think the pride thing is like, I truly believe you can be the best version of yourself here.
*  And I think anybody else in the world can be the best, most successful version of themselves
*  here.
*  And that's why I'm proud to be American.
*  You can reach your full potential in this country.
*  It's a fun place.
*  Hey, there's a lot of fun places.
*  But can you reach your full potential in these other places?
*  They took fucking Jack Ma and they brought him into a basement when he got too powerful
*  in China.
*  He talked a little shit.
*  He thought he was bigger than the system.
*  So they shut it down.
*  They saw what was happening to our tech billionaires here and they're like, hey, we're not going
*  to let that fucking shit happen here.
*  You're going to the basement.
*  Here I'm not saying Joe Rogan isn't going to be successful no matter where he goes,
*  but you're going to have fucking issues if you're in China coming and having this much
*  influence and a podcast and do it.
*  You're going to have a talk.
*  You're going to have some basement talks.
*  But in this fucking country, you can be the greatest version of yourself.
*  And I don't know if there's another country that offers that opportunity.
*  And more importantly, anyone that's trying to stop that is un-American.
*  If you're trying to censor people's speech, if you're trying to stifle people's growth.
*  And Americans will fight for you because of it.
*  It happens.
*  This is the hit piece thing.
*  When we see the hit piece, it tears at our American identity.
*  Even if you don't admit you are, there's a part of you that's going, whoa, whoa, this
*  person's trying to be great.
*  And we're all here because we're trying to be great or our family came here to be great.
*  And this person's trying to be great and the world is trying to stop that.
*  Fuck them.
*  It's some people are trying to stop that.
*  Some people are trying to stop that.
*  But we're still, we have animosity for those people that are trying to stop greatness because
*  it is a core tenet here.
*  Yes.
*  You can be great.
*  An individual can be great here.
*  And I think that's a really special thing that we kind of lose sight of.
*  But it is what makes me proud.
*  Maybe it's because my mom's not from here and she came here and she felt like she had
*  all this opportunity.
*  And it was like, you can't tell my mom that's not the greatest country in the world.
*  So I kind of like, I grew up with that.
*  Of course there's tons of problems, but this idea that you can really achieve.
*  You're always going to have problems when you have human beings.
*  Yes.
*  And there's no perfect solution.
*  Like universal basic income isn't the perfect solution.
*  Welfare is not the perfect solution.
*  There's no perfect solution to fix all that ails us.
*  But at least here, you can go from the bottom to the top.
*  You can go for it.
*  You can really go for it and you're not like...
*  Start from the bottom now.
*  Facts.
*  And some places, you might have the aptitude to go from the bottom to the top, but the
*  culture will be oppressive.
*  And I'm not even talking about third world.
*  I'm not talking about China.
*  I'm talking about there are places where there's a system where like, hey, you're working class.
*  How dare you try to not be working class.
*  Yeah, that's what my friends in England say.
*  My mom's from Scotland.
*  That's what it was.
*  It's like, how dare you try to be great?
*  And here it's like, wait, you're not trying to be great?
*  Why aren't you trying to be great?
*  You have the opportunity to be great.
*  And when we see greatness, we support it.
*  That's not to say that we don't have jealousy and animosity, but there still is a version
*  of it here where it's like, nah, that motherfucker's great.
*  And I am excited by that person's greatness.
*  If you're a winner.
*  But then you're also going to have a bunch of people that are just happy when you fall.
*  That's humans.
*  That is humans.
*  We have it too.
*  But there is not a cultural oppression that exists for greatness.
*  The place is built to go to the top.
*  And it makes me proud.
*  For me, I wish more people would grab onto that idea.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's all of us too.
*  That's what's so crazy about the idea of the American flag, the symbol, the American flag
*  is offensive.
*  It's the best flag.
*  But it's so crazy that that's all of us.
*  That's even the good, the stuff that you think is good about America.
*  Even if you're like the hardcore, the most hard, far left, hippie fucking anarchist.
*  You are a part of America.
*  Our ideas are America as well.
*  That flag is yours too.
*  And we kind of need them.
*  We need everybody.
*  We need that back and forth.
*  We need that pendulum to swing.
*  We need balance.
*  We do.
*  Because yeah, you see what happens when there's just people existing in that echo tree.
*  You saw what happens in fucking San Francisco or even LA.
*  You see an idea permeate and then a very lax law or a lack of enforcement of that law create
*  a culture that people are now not happy with.
*  If you ask the average person in LA or San Francisco, they're like, maybe we need some
*  rules now.
*  I think rules would be OK.
*  We could punish some crimes.
*  It's OK.
*  When you exist in the echo chamber, you're fighting for different sides of liberalism.
*  You don't have that balance where these people are yelling at these people and we kind of
*  end up in here.
*  And that's healthy.
*  That little back and forth is healthy.
*  And I don't know.
*  I get stoked off the American experience.
*  But it does make me sad when I feel like everybody's upset about the right thinks it sucks.
*  The lefts think it sucks.
*  Everybody just thinks it sucks.
*  And it's like, I don't know, man.
*  Well, I just think there's a lot of problems that exist today that weren't problems decades
*  ago, particularly social issues with the the impact of social media has thrown this country
*  into a fucking turmoil.
*  What do you mean?
*  It's it's a force that we didn't anticipate that the amount of echo chambers that exist,
*  the amount of people that gather up together in these groups and they have full confirmation
*  bias, they only believe one side.
*  They disregard all evidence from the other side.
*  They dig their heels in.
*  They want to be on the right side of history.
*  They want to win.
*  If Donald Trump wins the threat to democracy, Joe Biden's a criminal.
*  He's a threat to democracy.
*  Our whole life is at stake with this election.
*  If you're on the wrong side, you've been co-opted by the bad people.
*  There's just so much tension that exists today where you can't have a difference of opinion
*  with your neighbors, where it used to be if your neighbor was a Republican and you were
*  a Democrat, nobody gave a shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, what's up, Bob?
*  Maybe he would get annoying.
*  You want to talk to you about fucking Watergate or something like that?
*  I gotta go, bro.
*  I gotta go.
*  But it wasn't it wasn't anti-American.
*  It wasn't as divisive.
*  He wasn't the main problem in the world.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You know, he wasn't a Nazi.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  He just wanted to hold on to his money.
*  Exactly.
*  He just thought you were a little bit of a pussy.
*  Yeah.
*  And you just thought he was maybe a little racist.
*  Yeah.
*  But you still barbecued.
*  Yeah.
*  It wasn't that crazy.
*  You said hi.
*  You waved to each other when you were in the driveway.
*  Yeah.
*  And now you think it's so divisive because of the internet, the echo chambers are created,
*  and it's this good versus evil mentality on both sides.
*  So how dare you hang out with someone who's evil?
*  Yeah.
*  What does that make you?
*  It's crazy.
*  And then also, like, people dig their heels in and put fucking political signs on their
*  front lawn.
*  My mom used to do that.
*  When she left in Florida.
*  She had Hillary Clinton signs on her front lawn and people kept stealing them.
*  I'm like, Mom, take those down.
*  Wait, what do you mean?
*  What do you mean?
*  Like, what type of signs?
*  Hillary for president.
*  Oh, hilarious.
*  Your mom.
*  Yeah.
*  The apple falls far from the tree.
*  Yeah.
*  And then she goes, they keep taking my signs.
*  I'm like, Mom, don't put those signs up.
*  It's really you.
*  You're living in Florida.
*  It's just you.
*  You're just sending people to take the signs down.
*  She was living in Florida.
*  She was living in Florida.
*  I'm like, what do you expect?
*  It's a red state.
*  So was she a big liberal?
*  Oh, my mom's a huge liberal.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Does she acknowledge that liberal?
*  They were hippies when I was a kid.
*  We lived in San Francisco during the height of the anti-war movement.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  I grew up, when I was seven years old, we moved to San Francisco.
*  Do you remember this?
*  Yeah, very clearly.
*  Yeah.
*  And has this kind of, like, informed your politics a bit?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, we lived in a gay neighborhood.
*  It was like all these hippies and gay guys would whistle at my stepdad.
*  No way.
*  Yeah, it was funny.
*  So you're like, I need to learn martial arts.
*  No, it wasn't dangerous.
*  These guys are coming for me.
*  It wasn't dangerous.
*  I mean, there was some crime.
*  You know, I got, like, my basketball stolen once.
*  But it wasn't bad.
*  It was a different time.
*  It was like, there was a lot of peace.
*  Peace and love was real back then.
*  Like, the hippie movement was a real thing.
*  And you know...
*  Oh, you felt it was pure.
*  Yeah, it was...
*  They were nice people, man.
*  I didn't know...
*  I didn't even know what the N-word meant until I moved to Florida.
*  No way.
*  I never heard it.
*  I never heard it.
*  I never heard it in San Francisco.
*  Nobody leaves me.
*  I didn't hear it.
*  Nobody said it.
*  Wow.
*  It was so integrated.
*  It was like everybody was like Asian and black and white.
*  And it was just like...
*  The hippie movement was real, man.
*  And it permeated the city in a kind way.
*  They were nice people.
*  It was a different time.
*  And it was also...
*  When I was living there was when the Vietnam War ended.
*  And I remember very clearly thinking to myself as like...
*  I guess I was 10 or something.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, oh boy.
*  You felt relief as a kid?
*  I'm so happy because now there won't be war anymore.
*  They figured out that war is bad.
*  Because while Vietnam was going on, everybody knew it was a crazy war.
*  It didn't make any sense.
*  There was all these protests.
*  And then there was like Kent State where they shot the fucking protesters.
*  The National Guard came and shot the protesters.
*  So there was this craziness, this turmoil in this country that didn't exist.
*  It was a way that...
*  Wait a minute.
*  This is interesting.
*  More than now you felt?
*  It's hard to say because I was a kid.
*  But there was definitely a thing where they were drafting people to go and fight in this
*  war.
*  And that was part of it.
*  It was a conscription.
*  They were forcing you to go die in war.
*  And we knew people that had gotten forced to go over there.
*  And knew people that had died over there.
*  It was weird.
*  It was a weird fear that they could force you to go to war.
*  And so when that was over, there was this relief like, okay, good.
*  We figured that out.
*  And then fucking 10 years later, I was hanging out with my roommate.
*  We were watching Operation Desert Storm kick off on TV like this.
*  It's crazy.
*  Here we go again.
*  Here we go, man.
*  It was me and my buddy Jimmy Dutilio.
*  We were sitting in our house and we were watching this.
*  We were living together in Malden, Massachusetts.
*  And we were watching this fucking TV while we were at war.
*  Holy shit.
*  We were watching the tracer missiles, the tracer rounds.
*  The way you could see the bullets.
*  They're lit up as they're flying through the air and they're shooting them out of helicopters
*  and shit.
*  Operation Desert Storm, the first war, it was like the first war that was televised.
*  You could watch shit get blown up.
*  And I can't believe it.
*  I was like, God damn it, we're doing it again.
*  And this was like, it was I guess the 90s, right?
*  When was the Iraq War?
*  When was the first Iraq War?
*  Bush.
*  When they pulled out.
*  Bush is, what is first Bush?
*  92?
*  So they pulled out.
*  We only lost a small number of troops.
*  Gulf War, 90 to 91.
*  So it was quick.
*  And Bill Hicks had the great bit about it.
*  He goes, it's only a war when two armies are fighting.
*  And he goes, they say, Bill, they say the Iraq War is the fifth largest army.
*  He goes, yeah, but after the first two, there's a big drop off.
*  He goes, the Salvation Army is number three.
*  That's funny.
*  It's a great bit.
*  But it's true.
*  Yeah, they gotta find a way to justify it.
*  You know, the guys were just practicing.
*  They were just doing stuff.
*  Remember, you had that bit, like pull up G12.
*  What does G12 do?
*  Let's find out.
*  And they're just like going through the weapons catalog.
*  Like pull that one up.
*  Shoot it.
*  Oh shit.
*  What's G13 do?
*  And that was a Hicks bit.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck.
*  Bro.
*  That one confused the shit out of everybody because he thought war was easy.
*  We thought, bro, we'll just go over there and fuck everybody up real quick like we did.
*  But why do we think war was easy?
*  Because they did it.
*  You're saying afterwards we thought war was easy.
*  The Iraq War was so easy for us.
*  That we thought that's war.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Whereas Vietnam was this like difficult, long, dread trap.
*  Didn't make any sense either.
*  This one was more like, oh, there's a death spot.
*  We gotta get them out.
*  Look how quick we could do it.
*  He invaded Kuwait.
*  Look how quick we take care of business.
*  This is how.
*  And we're like, god damn, America's pretty badass.
*  So we got super cocky.
*  It was like Mike Tyson before he fought Buster Douglas.
*  We're like, Mike Tyson fights a blow off.
*  I'm not paying 50 bucks for that.
*  It's gonna last 30 seconds.
*  And then you don't pay for the Buster Douglas fight.
*  You're like, no.
*  What?
*  He lost?
*  No way.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And so then the second Iraq War, and then you got real casualties.
*  The invasion of Afghanistan.
*  It's going on forever and ever and ever.
*  And it doesn't make any sense to realize, oh god, this is a never ending war.
*  This is almost like Vietnam.
*  This is crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  It is horrible, man.
*  I mean, that's the most horrible thing that people do.
*  And it's the one thing that we don't think people will ever stop doing.
*  Which is war.
*  War.
*  If you ask people, you think in 10 years there'll be no war.
*  No way.
*  There's never been a time.
*  There's never been a time where we've been alive with our tribal instincts that we haven't
*  decided to control someone's resources or justify an invasion or come up with some reason
*  why someone's wronged us and blow up pipelines.
*  We did blow it up, huh?
*  I don't think they did it.
*  Why would they do it?
*  Why would they cut off their supply of gas to Europe and miss out on all that money?
*  So CIA does it?
*  Or?
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I would be just talking completely out of my ass, but Seymour Hersh said the
*  CIA did it.
*  Wow.
*  He's a very, very well-respected journalist.
*  I mean, he's about top of the food chain.
*  He's a legit journalist.
*  But what does he know?
*  And what does he ... I mean, if you weren't there, how much of it is disinformation?
*  How much can get shuffled down even to you as a journalist that's just straight bullshit?
*  They're sophisticated, man.
*  I mean, these people that are running ... what do you call it?
*  The deep state, the intelligence agencies.
*  There's people that want to disband all of them, like the Vivek Ramaswamy guys.
*  I think you need them because I think the world operates in a very clandestine way.
*  There's other countries have agencies that are doing the same thing the CIA does.
*  If we don't have a better one, that's not good.
*  If you don't have an army, if you're like, we don't need an army, we have flowers.
*  You need a fucking army.
*  You want to keep peace, you need an army.
*  You want to keep an eye on all the terrorist organizations in the world that are planning
*  on blowing up America, yeah.
*  You need a CIA.
*  You need a CIA.
*  You need all of them.
*  You need the NSA.
*  You need all of them.
*  You need those people.
*  But in those people, you're going to get cowboys.
*  You're going to get people that say, I know how we can fund the Contras versus the Sandinistas.
*  Sell drugs.
*  Let's just move some crack through LA.
*  We can make millions of dollars.
*  No one knows.
*  So you get freeway Ricky Ross.
*  You bring him in.
*  He's making untold amounts of money and he's doing it for the government.
*  And that's why he's not getting arrested.
*  And he doesn't even know.
*  And he doesn't even figure it out until he goes to jail.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Because he doesn't even know how to read until he goes to jail.
*  But that is interesting.
*  A lot of these actors don't even know that they're involved.
*  No!
*  It's way less involved than we believe it is.
*  There's so many layers to it.
*  And it must be so fun to be the doomer who's like, yeah, to be like that.
*  I would never want to leave.
*  If I was the head of the Pentagon, what a great job.
*  Show up every day.
*  You're fucking Mercedes Benz AMG.
*  You hop out with your cufflinks.
*  Let's fucking destroy Central America.
*  Let's go, baby.
*  Let's go.
*  You're on Adderall and you're fucking hopped up, having a good time, getting work done.
*  You're a great asset to the company.
*  You know, I love this company.
*  And I know this company loves you.
*  And you're fucking all in, buddy, at the expense of your marriage, your family, your friends.
*  You're lying to everybody around you because you can't tell them what you're doing.
*  Nobody can know because they're fucking signal.
*  Bitch, you think that thing's secure?
*  No way.
*  They made it.
*  I bet they did.
*  Yeah, because you get to a certain point with success in this country where you have to
*  be integrated into the government.
*  Google is integrated.
*  Facebook is integrated.
*  They have to be.
*  How do you think the fucking FBI was in Twitter?
*  Hey, we're getting pressure from all of our constituents.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  We're getting pressure from this organization that gives us immense amounts of money.
*  And we'd like you to put the fucking kibush on this stuff that's a big problem.
*  Whether it's a laptop story or whether it's the covid misinformation, whatever it is.
*  So how do you maintain your sovereignty?
*  That's a good question.
*  How do you do it?
*  You?
*  Me personally?
*  I got to pee.
*  When I come back, let's talk about that.
*  Yeah, let's do it.
*  We're back.
*  OK, how do you maintain your sovereignty?
*  You are the most influential person on the planet.
*  Agencies would love to have a hold of you, I imagine.
*  How do you make sure that you create distance between you and them so you can put out the
*  content you want to do?
*  I haven't even thought about it.
*  But you know that they must try.
*  Yeah, but I mean, like, first of all, I'm not a valid source of information, but I can
*  get you valid sources of information.
*  Meaning that I'm not an expert in anything other than like martial arts.
*  And I can give you some information about some things.
*  I can talk to you about stand-up comedy.
*  I think you're being humble, but OK.
*  No, but I'm being honest.
*  I'm not a legitimate expert in anything.
*  But I can bring experts on and I can have honest conversations with them.
*  And as a human being that is in this world, it is imperative that we have access to all
*  sorts of information, even information that might not be correct.
*  You got to know why the person thinks the way they think.
*  Even if I disagree with them.
*  Why do you think that?
*  How does it work in your head?
*  Have you considered this?
*  I'll steel man their position.
*  I try to find out.
*  And if you're silencing people that are from Stanford and Harvard like they did during
*  COVID, actual experts, you're doing a disservice to human beings, including you and your family.
*  Because if you're lying or allowing people to lie about medication or about the adverse
*  effects of medication, that is not just you.
*  That's everyone that you know that's also going to take that medication upon your admission
*  or your recommendation.
*  You're doing a disservice to everyone, to the whole.
*  The person who's telling the truth is doing a service to everyone, the whole.
*  So how do we parcel out the truth?
*  You got to listen to everybody.
*  And then you make that decision.
*  It takes time.
*  Look how long it took from COVID to figure out what was going on.
*  You remember the early videos?
*  You will not get it.
*  The virus stops with you.
*  If you take this vaccine, now it's like you will not die.
*  Which is probably not going to die.
*  You probably won't die.
*  You won't get hospitalized.
*  Well, how do you know it's going to get hospitalized in the first place?
*  Most people didn't get hospitalized.
*  Do you know what the percentage of people, even in the early days, got hospitalized from
*  COVID?
*  5%.
*  Well, which is a lot for 300 million people.
*  That is a lot.
*  It's a lot.
*  But still, to not even retract publicly some of the statements made and to vilify the people
*  that were putting out that other information is a very dangerous situation.
*  Well, the CDC had to take down all of their quotes.
*  Was it the FDA or the CDC?
*  The FDA.
*  The FDA had to take down all of their tweets about COVID in reference to ivermectin.
*  Like you're not a horse, y'all.
*  Stop it.
*  You remember that?
*  Was that the CDC?
*  Find who made that.
*  You're not a horse, y'all.
*  That was one of them.
*  This is about a medication that had been prescribed billions of times to human beings.
*  The FDA.
*  You're not a horse.
*  You're not a cow.
*  Seriously, y'all.
*  You're not a horse.
*  You're not a cow.
*  Seriously, y'all.
*  Stop it.
*  Why you should not use ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19 from FDA.
*  That is just propaganda.
*  Just full on propaganda.
*  It's like saying penicillin is veterinary medicine because they do use it in veterinary
*  applications.
*  But it's for humans too, you fucking idiot.
*  And has it been used for humans?
*  Has it saved lives?
*  Yes.
*  Has ivermectin won the fucking Nobel Prize?
*  Yes.
*  So is penicillin.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a human medication that has one of the safest profiles of any medication known.
*  And now they had to take down, pull the article that they had to take all that down.
*  So they had to delete 140 social media posts that were disparaging ivermectin.
*  I didn't even know this.
*  They just lost in court.
*  Pierre Cori has been ringing the bell.
*  FDA agrees to delete your not a horse ivermectin tweet.
*  The FBI did not admit to wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement.
*  Oh, that's great.
*  They don't have to admit they were wrong because they were wrong.
*  They don't have to admit it.
*  We know you're wrong.
*  Great.
*  You don't have to admit it.
*  Go ahead.
*  The agency said the settlement detailed the Thursday court filing in the U.S. District
*  Court for the Southern District of Texas does not mean it changes position that no data
*  shows ivermectin to be an effective COVID treatment.
*  The agency has chosen to resolve this lawsuit rather than continuing to litigate over statements
*  that are between two and nearly four years old.
*  Oh, we said those four years ago, guys.
*  The FDA said an emailed statement.
*  The agency has not authorized or approved ivermectin for use in preventing or treating
*  COVID-19.
*  Doctors have always been allowed to use off label medications, especially when shown to
*  be effective.
*  Right.
*  And there's a ton of randomized controlled trials that shows ivermectin to be effective
*  for the treatment of COVID-19.
*  Right.
*  Including in entire Uttar Pradesh in India.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all they used it.
*  They had an incredible result.
*  Yeah.
*  Look, people have used it.
*  They used it.
*  But when I used it and I talked, I had no fucking idea what can of worms I was open
*  Yeah, they made you look like this.
*  They changed the color of my face.
*  CNN was all in, but to their own detriment.
*  And now people lost faith in CNN.
*  The COVID thing to them was one of the worst experiences in terms of public trust.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I think public trust is an all time low in general.
*  And that's their bed that they made.
*  So that's the question is like, how do you start believing again?
*  There is an importance in believing and trusting the systems that we have.
*  It is important that we trust the medical field.
*  Right?
*  Maybe not blindly and maybe we should have more information.
*  But it is important when we go into the, like I was just telling you, like with my daughter,
*  I was like, okay, it's time to get vaccines.
*  And I freaked out.
*  I genuinely freaked out.
*  I told you I was scared.
*  And I didn't do enough research.
*  I'm in that room and I'm like, I think I need the weekend.
*  And yeah, it's...
*  All of my friends that even are doctors who had no questions about the vaccines before,
*  at all, before COVID, they recommended all of them.
*  Now, a lot of them are changing their tune.
*  So they have more skepticism based on the information that came out about the COVID
*  vaccine or vaccines in general?
*  First of all, just the propaganda campaign behind the COVID vaccine.
*  So once they saw this propaganda campaign...
*  Total denial of any adverse effects, even though they personally knew people who had
*  strokes, heart attacks, died, the died suddenly thing, the fact that athletes were dropping
*  like flies.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  The athletes thing was nuts.
*  That was scary because these are the people that are in the best shape in the world.
*  Soccer players having heart attacks, just dropping dead, all of them vaccinated.
*  When you're seeing these people just drop dead, reporters on TV just fainting, passing
*  out, people I know personally that got the shot that blacked out, quite a few.
*  One of them, two guys I know that have fucking pacemakers now.
*  One of them is in his 30s, one of them is in his 40s, as a fucking pacemaker now.
*  And you should at least have that information before you make that decision.
*  Well, you should know that that information exists and instead they're trying to hide
*  it and they're trying to gaslight you about it.
*  And then there's the thing about all cause mortality.
*  The increase in all cause mortality is there's a jump in all cause mortality after administration
*  of the vaccines.
*  All cause mortality is people that die from everything, die from heart attacks, stroke,
*  cancer.
*  All cause mortality went up in some groups as much as 40%.
*  These are the control groups that have taken the vaccine.
*  Right.
*  Well, amongst people, well, people just in general, more people are dying.
*  The percentage of all cause mortality is in certain groups up significantly.
*  I think in England they did a study that said it was up 20% across the board.
*  In some groups like 18 to 49, in some groups it was up as high as 40%.
*  That means that 40% more people are dying from cancer, heart attacks, strokes, everything
*  than were before.
*  After this event.
*  Everything, everything, including people that probably would have died anyway.
*  But 40% more in some groups are dying.
*  And there are other variables that exist as well.
*  Sure.
*  This is a weird time.
*  Lack of medical attention during COVID.
*  People didn't see their doctors.
*  Maybe there was things that, alcoholism, people drank more.
*  There's a lot of factors.
*  But one of those factors might be this experimental medication.
*  The resistance against that being possible is crazy.
*  It's because people, first of all, they advocated for it.
*  They told you to get it.
*  They probably chastised people and scolded people that didn't get it.
*  Now they have this opinion that they have started with and they're stuck with and they
*  want to be correct.
*  They don't want to back off.
*  It takes a very courageous person to say, I'm fucking wrong.
*  Not only was I wrong, but I probably fucked people over and a lot of people might have
*  been adversely affected.
*  That's your career, your life, your identity.
*  Yes.
*  If you're an intellectual.
*  That builds your entire identity around being right.
*  Yes.
*  And there's massive pressure from all these institutions that have always been unquestionable
*  in the past, like the FDA or the CDC.
*  It's like a botched surgery.
*  If you go for plastic surgery and somebody fucks it up, you're not going back to that
*  doctor.
*  They're terrified.
*  Exactly.
*  They have to go, no, we were right, 100% right.
*  Trust me, I want to continue doing this.
*  The skepticism starts there and then it starts to bleed into all vaccines.
*  Exactly.
*  Which is okay to have.
*  That's what some friends of mine that are physicians.
*  And then you read what Robert Kennedy says.
*  Robert Kennedy is the guy that gets put in the kook category.
*  And I had to admit that to him when I had him on the podcast.
*  I had an opinion of you that was based on propaganda.
*  I thought you were this wacky conspiracy theorist guy.
*  You're nuts.
*  You're the guy that's telling you, like fucking, you know, take silver iodine, you're going
*  to never get sick again.
*  You know what I mean?
*  You put him in this category of like holistic medicine guys or whatever.
*  That's not even a bad thing.
*  But you put him in this naturopath category, kooky category, conspiracy theorist, tinfoil
*  hat.
*  And then I read his book.
*  I read The Real Anthony Fauci and you read that book and you're like, okay, if this is
*  not true, why isn't he getting sued?
*  And it seems like this is the exact same playlist that they ran during the AIDS crisis.
*  And that's the Dallas Buyers Club.
*  The Dallas Buyers Club is all about that.
*  It's all about Anthony Fauci.
*  It's all about restricting medication to people that have HIV and forcing them to take AZT,
*  which was killing everybody.
*  AZT kills people.
*  It was a chemotherapy medication they stopped using because it kills people quicker than
*  cancer.
*  People that were asymptomatic from HIV were put on AZT and they were dead within six months.
*  It's a chemotherapy medication you're supposed to stay on.
*  No chemotherapy medication you stay on indefinitely.
*  You take them for a course because it's damaging because it's killing the cancer, but it's
*  also killing you.
*  And then it kills the cancer and you recover and then the cancer is gone and that's how
*  chemotherapy works when it works.
*  But they just kept them on the whole time.
*  But they weren't using it for cancer anymore.
*  Read the book.
*  Not only that, they experimented with vaccines for HIV on foster kids in New York and a bunch
*  of them died.
*  It's all in the book.
*  And if it's not true, why didn't they?
*  They sue his ass.
*  Why isn't he getting sued?
*  Why aren't there articles written pointing out all the things that are absolutely wrong
*  with what he's saying about the HIV crisis?
*  So your position is fair skepticism about the vaccines and let's get some more studies
*  and information out there and then we can make our own decisions based on that.
*  What is the cause of the uptick in chronic illness, autism, all these different things?
*  What is it?
*  Are there environmental factors?
*  Is it contamination?
*  Is it food?
*  Is it pollution?
*  What is it?
*  What is it?
*  What is it?
*  And could it be that too?
*  Could it be these vaccines?
*  Is it possible that these people that tell these stories about having perfectly healthy
*  children and then them getting vaccinated and then also the kid like going non-responsive?
*  What that seems like it's possible that there's a correlation there.
*  If there's a cause and then there's an effect.
*  If there is an action and then there's an effect.
*  Let's see if there's a connection here.
*  The thing that you do and all these parents, you could say a bunch of them it was just
*  a coincidental that the kids started showing it after the medication was administered and
*  maybe that's true.
*  Maybe that's true.
*  And how do we know if that's not even considered?
*  I think there's a timing thing too.
*  If it's a taboo subject.
*  Isn't there like a timing thing where like kids don't show those symptoms until one and
*  that is when you vaccinate them or something.
*  So there are some correlations.
*  Correlational issues here.
*  Doesn't mean causation.
*  Of course not.
*  But let's study it.
*  Let's fucking look at it.
*  We're looking like a whacker.
*  That injecting kids with chemicals including mercury and aluminum that you're doing this.
*  This might have a negative effect on some kids and that maybe the corresponding uptick
*  in these chronic illnesses and allergies and diseases and autism.
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe.
*  What was the allergy?
*  You can't even say anything.
*  Aluminum.
*  That's right because every one of the vaccines has a little aluminum in it.
*  Well the way it is you have an inert form of the virus.
*  And then you have this irritant.
*  You have this thing that fucks with your body.
*  Your body goes what is this?
*  I gotta go fix it.
*  The aluminum is there.
*  Oh there's a vaccine or there's a virus in here.
*  I'll create the antibodies.
*  I'll create the antibodies.
*  Yeah.
*  And it works.
*  It does work.
*  But does it also have negative effects?
*  And is it a volume thing?
*  Is it the amount of vaccines you give a kid all together?
*  Yes.
*  You know they're trying to give your kid like HPV vaccine right from birth.
*  Yeah.
*  Like when do they start giving them hepatitis B?
*  Twelve hours in.
*  That's when birth.
*  Twelve hours in they came into the room and they're like hepatitis B.
*  Yo!
*  And I literally and I was like what is it?
*  Because I didn't know what it was.
*  And they're like it's a disease that could kill your kid.
*  And I was like well we should probably give it to her.
*  And then I'm like how do you even get it?
*  And they're like it's a sexually transmitted disease.
*  And I was like hold on.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that we could pump the brakes a little bit.
*  Twelve hours old?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  We got time.
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay so I understand.
*  So now there's a skepticism.
*  People see.
*  But then right now just having this conversation.
*  And talking about it the way we've talked about it so carefully.
*  Yeah.
*  You'll be labeled an anti-vaxxer.
*  So.
*  Andrew Schultz and Joe Rogan float around anti-vaxx conspiracy theories.
*  Well we're not we're not conspirizing right now right?
*  Nope.
*  We're just literally saying maybe it's okay to do the research without shame.
*  Well how is it not possible to talk about it without being labeled a kook?
*  If this is a thing.
*  If you're injecting kids with with chemicals.
*  Yeah.
*  And we know that medications have adverse effects.
*  Even simple medications.
*  Some people have horrible effects from all kinds of stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  There's people that can't take like Aaron Rodgers couldn't take the mRNA vaccines because
*  there's an ingredient in them that he's deathly allergic to.
*  So there's a so an interesting thing is I asked the doctor and she was actually great.
*  The doctor was really great.
*  Like her mom was kind of anti-vaxxers.
*  She's like so I understand it.
*  There's no pressure.
*  I was telling you this.
*  Yeah.
*  And then she said this was interesting.
*  I was like what about if we schedule them out delayed them I think is what they say.
*  Yeah.
*  And so you have less viral load at one time.
*  She said something interesting.
*  She goes listen every vaccine has a little bit of preservative in it right.
*  You need to have a little bit in order to keep that inert disease alive or whatever.
*  She goes so the question you have to ask now is OK maybe the preservative isn't good to
*  put in your kid and now you're putting more of it in because you're doing more vaccines
*  over a longer period of time.
*  So this is a variable I didn't even fucking think of.
*  I'm trying to lower the viral load that my eight week old baby has inside her but now
*  I'm increasing the preservative load that the baby has and I don't know the effects
*  of that.
*  And that's why I had to walk out.
*  And the thing is the medical institutions have been captured by pharmaceutical drug
*  companies and they're captured.
*  Well they're captured by the agencies.
*  I mean it's not as simple as a doctor is basing it all on his education and his understanding
*  of this particular situation and the objective science of all of it.
*  There's a narrative.
*  There's a narrative that gets distributed.
*  And that was the narrative during COVID.
*  You must get vaccinated.
*  They were telling people to get vaccinated right after they got over COVID.
*  It doesn't even make sense.
*  It's completely unscientific.
*  And they make it restrictive.
*  Like for example my wife in order for her to go to school had to get the booster.
*  Like she was getting her MBA and she had to.
*  So and the same thing with kids.
*  Like if you want to put your kid in like a school they have to have them all.
*  You want to put it in a daycare.
*  If you want to travel.
*  If you want to fly.
*  Certain jobs.
*  So you see you start to feel the pressure and the outside pressure makes you go okay
*  I'm being forced into this decision.
*  I don't really have my freedom.
*  You say I have my freedom but I want my kid to get educated.
*  I want my kid to be able to go see their grandparents.
*  I want my kid to do these things.
*  And yeah you do feel this but you feel a social pressure.
*  You don't want to be labeled a fucking anti-vax weirdo but at the same time it was hard as
*  hell for my wife and I to get pregnant.
*  So I'm really protective over this innocent little baby and I don't want to be responsible
*  for giving him something that could fuck him up.
*  I don't know how I live with myself.
*  Clearly.
*  Do you remember when Jenny McCarthy was saying that vaccine caused her son to be autistic
*  and she was just attacked mercilessly.
*  I don't remember but essentially it was like kind of the end of her ever being taken seriously.
*  It was kind of the end of her career.
*  Jenny McCarthy was huge.
*  MTV days I remember.
*  MTV days she had her own sitcom.
*  Jenny McCarthy was doing a lot of different things and you don't hear about her at all
*  anymore.
*  I think Robert De Niro even tried to.
*  She had a TV show recently.
*  She's been on a show.
*  What is it?
*  The Masked Singer or whatever.
*  She's a judge on that.
*  Oh, okay.
*  So she's back.
*  But for a long time she was like persona non grata.
*  What is the Masked Singer?
*  It's a game show.
*  I'm so ignorant.
*  I don't even know that show's still in the air.
*  Anyway, it's one of these things where you're like.
*  She's one of the judges?
*  Okay.
*  So she's okay.
*  But she, if the conversation comes up with vaccines, like people roll their eyes, like
*  oh Jenny McCarthy.
*  So what's the way to.
*  She's anti-science.
*  But what's the way to like talk about it and have the conversation.
*  We're not anti-vaccine movement.
*  We're pro-safe vaccine.
*  Beautiful woman, huh?
*  Oh yeah.
*  2015.
*  Well damn, bro.
*  She could still be beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, Jamie's rude.
*  She's all bitch now.
*  It was the reference to when the.
*  No, it's just, I don't know.
*  It's one of those things where like you're fucking, you're scared because you want to
*  protect this thing that you really care about and love both ways.
*  You don't want them to get a disease.
*  Of course.
*  And get sick that you could have avoided while at the same time you don't want to put something
*  in them that could have a negative effect.
*  So you're just in this stalemate.
*  I know.
*  And.
*  And you don't know who to trust.
*  And that's the problem with information right now.
*  It's like I don't think we know what to believe about anything.
*  It's like.
*  Right.
*  Even the fucking, the trans visibility day thing.
*  Like every headline was Biden declares Easter trans visibility day.
*  And I read it and I was like, there is no way.
*  Like yeah, maybe there's a bunch of lefties there, the liberal leaning, but there's no
*  way that he would declare Easter this way.
*  And I looked into it.
*  Trans visibility day started like 15 years ago.
*  Three years ago they declared it and then Easter obviously changes every year.
*  The date, it doesn't change the day.
*  And then it ends up on the Sunday.
*  But the headline is Biden declares Easter trans visibility day.
*  Once I read that and I know it's fake, now every headline is fake to me.
*  And I think now I'm in this like, we're up, maybe we're all in this whirlpool.
*  They're all using it because there's money to be made out of it.
*  That click is valuable.
*  And they will knowingly, like we were talking about that woman earlier with the, with the
*  Huberman thing, there is money to be made out of that.
*  And as long as there is money to be made from it, they will.
*  They'll go for it.
*  And they'll remove information that is incredibly important to the truth of the story.
*  I don't know how you solve that.
*  That thing, the Biden thing is kind of crazy because, you know, on this day of our Lord,
*  like they make this declaration and they know that it's going to happen on Easter Sunday.
*  They know this year or maybe last year, but when they started, they're not like, how are
*  we going to take away Easter from?
*  It's like Thanksgiving.
*  It always happens on a Thursday.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like,
*  Easter Sunday is always a Sunday and it could vary from April to March.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Like it could be March 31st or it could be April 23rd.
*  Like it's really wide.
*  Yeah.
*  The range that Easter Sunday falls on.
*  They saw it coming this year and they're probably like, fuck, if we move it, we hate the trance.
*  If we don't move it, we hate the Christians.
*  I think they saw it as an opportunity to like, in an election cycle.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It was absurd.
*  The loons, the loons on the left, they're all in with that stuff.
*  Joe doesn't know what a trance is.
*  Well he knows one of them got fired for stealing bags and the other one pulled their tits out.
*  He thinks that's a woman.
*  He's 80 years old.
*  If you went to him and you were like, that's actually a man, he would go, there's no fucking
*  way.
*  Show it to me.
*  Bro, that administration is all in on that stuff in such a hardcore way that he got interviewed
*  by Dylan Mulvaney.
*  Yeah.
*  And he thought that was a woman.
*  And I've been a girl for 350 days.
*  He's like, oh God bless you.
*  God bless you.
*  That's what he said.
*  Did you ever see that interview?
*  No.
*  Oh, it's wild.
*  It's wild.
*  But like, like, like I think none of us really believe he's making the decisions, right?
*  He's just like a puppet for the.
*  Yeah.
*  He's just there to get lambasted when all these things happen.
*  Yeah.
*  And then he forgets about it immediately afterwards.
*  Yeah, he doesn't know.
*  He's the perfect guy to blame for things.
*  Exactly.
*  And that's why he's there.
*  That's why you get the eight year old dude.
*  But the idea that they're going to keep running him is just bananas.
*  I mean.
*  You're going to keep him in there.
*  I can't believe that's real, but as time goes on, I'm starting to think they might actually
*  keep running him.
*  Yeah.
*  They're, I don't know.
*  I don't know why that they would switch him out.
*  They're not in a position that can switch him out for anybody.
*  Who steps in?
*  Well, he would have to kick the bucket.
*  Not Kamala.
*  But he would have to kick the bucket.
*  And then they just slide Newsom in or somebody?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I think.
*  You think that's what they're hoping for?
*  May.
*  May.
*  I think he's got until May.
*  No way.
*  I feel like right around May, they're going to pull him.
*  No way.
*  Yeah.
*  And Newsom comes in.
*  I think he just has health problems and then the country understands and Newsom is going
*  to have his support fully.
*  And Kamala is going to like, I don't want to be president.
*  I'm cool with being vice president.
*  So Newsom runs with Kamala?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  I don't think they can pull Kamala.
*  I think as long as they keep her quiet, she's not.
*  She's already, whatever her liability sure is, she's so quiet.
*  You know what's been quite AOC?
*  They get them to fall in line, huh?
*  Yeah.
*  They were loud, dancing, doing TikToks and then they go, hey, hey, why don't you shut
*  the fuck up over there, Tits?
*  And then they shut up.
*  Also, don't you want to be president someday, Alexandra?
*  The carrot, they hang the fucking carrot.
*  And she probably could.
*  She could probably pull it off.
*  So it's there's a lot of factors, you know, and you're basically auditioning to be the
*  spokesperson for the machine.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  And it worked for Biden. He's the perfect example.
*  Yeah. Like, think about it. If you're part of the machine, you look at Biden's career
*  and you're like, oh, it does work out.
*  If I just play by the rules of the machine, they'll put me in position one day and I'll
*  have the power. You don't even have to be good.
*  You don't. You have to be there.
*  Especially if you have a bad guy.
*  Well, that's one of the reasons why Hillary wanted Trump to run.
*  Because I'll beat that guy.
*  I can't beat somebody that's competent.
*  Yeah. And it actually looks like a leader.
*  Yeah. Let's see this fucking maniac from The Apprentice.
*  And what does she find out?
*  I want to run him. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Whoops. Yeah.
*  Whoopsies. Yeah.
*  And now he's more popular than ever.
*  I think it's easy for him, actually, this time around.
*  I don't know if it's real.
*  What do you mean? Let's find out.
*  Let's find out if they can rig it.
*  Let's find out. Oh, yeah, they'll do everything they can.
*  Twenty twenty elections weren't rigged.
*  Let's say they weren't. Yeah.
*  You don't think there's something that can be done to move things one way or the other.
*  There's certainly the manipulation of media.
*  Of course. Right. Now, you want to talk about election interference.
*  So forget about mail in ballots.
*  Forget about all that stuff.
*  Access to information will affect elections, for example, when the government steps in
*  and tells Twitter to censor the Hunter Biden laptop story.
*  That laptop story, let's say they went all in.
*  They distributed to all the media.
*  And then Fox News starts telling you all the evidence that shows that Biden was getting
*  kickbacks and he's the big guy and 10 percent and all this money that went from billions of
*  millions of dollars and a brisma and all these.
*  Where's that money gone? Yeah.
*  Where were the contracts?
*  What's happening? How does he have this job teaching for a million dollars a year?
*  We doesn't even show up.
*  But what what is all of this game?
*  Like, what is this? That's the game.
*  And if that got into fence sitters, people are like, I don't know.
*  Trump's kind of gross.
*  But Biden's old.
*  But I'm still going to vote for Biden because Trump's a bad guy.
*  And then all I got. Yeah.
*  Biden's a bad guy. Trump might be the answer.
*  You know, we were fine while he was in office.
*  Let's run with him. Yeah.
*  I mean, it's basically election interference because you're withholding information that
*  would be detrimental to the person that you want to win.
*  You're absolutely election interference.
*  So anybody said this? There's no election interference.
*  That is election interference.
*  And then you have Google search results, which Robert Epstein and his research has shown
*  that Google search results.
*  I know. Right. Google search results have shown that you can manipulate.
*  And with his research, you can manipulate the search results through the algorithm.
*  And that will like highlight negative stories about the people that you want to be
*  negative or positive stories about the people you want to be positive.
*  And it can have an overall effect on how people vote, because most people are
*  surface information gatherers.
*  They read headlines like, uh, got it.
*  And then they go with it.
*  And the headline might be horse shit.
*  And you might get into the article.
*  I mean, we've done that so many times.
*  But wait a minute. This specifically says that that's not true.
*  Yeah. So what are they saying in the article?
*  Yeah. Complaints of.
*  Oh, it's a complaint of.
*  But then you get into it. Oh, but it's not real.
*  Yeah. Trans visibility. Yeah.
*  There's so many things like that that can just affect public opinion.
*  And there's so many people that will just say things publicly.
*  And they think that this is a fact.
*  The truth. They don't know that.
*  Like how many people you've seen got caught in that?
*  Women only make 70 cents to a man's dollar.
*  Yeah. How many people you ever seen?
*  They don't. That thing.
*  How come women women should be paid the same that men are paid?
*  No. Arguing the streets.
*  But they don't even understand what the argument is.
*  Yeah. The argument is men pick different jobs.
*  They work longer hours.
*  They don't take maternity leave. Overall, they make more money.
*  This is why.
*  Yeah.
*  They take jobs that are more dangerous.
*  They take jobs that are higher risk.
*  It also includes the most wealthy people, which are men.
*  Yeah. So that's going to skew it in a dramatic fashion.
*  Dramatic. Yeah.
*  Yeah. The top billionaires, they're all men, except for chicks that got divorced.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I was like, look at you, that is the best way to get rich.
*  If you want to be a female billionaire, chop it in half.
*  But the thing is, like female billionaires don't like that label.
*  They got it. So they become philanthropists.
*  Oh, that's why Bezos's wife is.
*  She's a philanthropist.
*  Billionaire philanthropist Mackenzie Bezos.
*  Yeah. Where does she get that money?
*  Yeah. Just being awesome.
*  Billionaire. Just being amazing.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  No, she was married to a psycho.
*  Yeah. The psycho made all the money.
*  And now she's distributing it to left wing causes.
*  And all the right wing guys are complaining.
*  Yeah. And Elon's mad.
*  Why is he upset? Elon was saying something about her distributing
*  these rich divorces, distributing to the downfall of democracy.
*  Yeah. Yeah, he's been going in.
*  He goes in, man.
*  It's really interesting to see how political he's gotten.
*  And immediately upon being because he was the darling of the left and the right.
*  Oh, yeah. Big, big time, the left.
*  But but the left, obviously for the cars. Right.
*  But the right, because he's a successful businessman. Right.
*  Yeah. And the second he takes a position politically,
*  he is chastised, shamed, ridiculed.
*  And even before that, think about it.
*  Everybody was invested in Tesla because the stock was going crazy.
*  So not only are you the darling, you're making me money. Right.
*  I want you to be great. Yeah.
*  Once you're making people money, they don't want to write bad shit about you.
*  Especially they've got a million dollars invested in Tesla.
*  Yeah. I'm not going to ridicule this guy and watch half of my money go away.
*  Yeah. And the second he opened his mouth about politics.
*  And the thing is, he snaps back at people.
*  He goes, which is crazy. He goes, bro. Yeah.
*  He dunks on people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Which is hilarious. Yeah.
*  But I'm also just like, you know, don't you got some science to do?
*  You know, like, how do you do with this? Yeah.
*  I don't understand how he does any of it.
*  AI, dude. He created another Elon.
*  Maybe he is. Maybe he's AI.
*  But but what he's done with Twitter or X is really interesting.
*  I call it Twitter. Yeah. It's hard for me to change.
*  Because it is an X that you made or is it a tweet?
*  Did you tweet something? It's a tweet.
*  I tweeted it. Yeah, it's Twitter.
*  It's kind of funny, though, because it is X. Yeah.
*  But you know, but it's Twitter.
*  But like the idea
*  that he is going to uphold
*  this soapbox for free speech, despite having some awful things said,
*  the greater outcome will be hopefully a civil society
*  where ideas can permeate freely.
*  He may have very well saved that humanity in some way,
*  because by providing this one platform where people can actually speak their mind.
*  Yeah. Up to a point. Yeah.
*  You know, I mean, there's still some rules. Sure.
*  But up to a point, you could see you get away with a lot of shit.
*  I see so much racist shit on Twitter now that I never saw before.
*  Like open, openly racist, openly racist. Wow.
*  Yeah. And then you see people chiming in that agree with it.
*  And it's like, wow.
*  And then people chime in and disagree. Yep.
*  Those voices are all heard and there's a place for all of them. Yeah.
*  And it's you just have to know that people do think certain ways.
*  You know, even if you don't like it, you have to know that people do
*  think certain ways.
*  And the answer to bad speech is not silencing speech.
*  It's better. Better. It's more compelling.
*  But you need to have a place where it can exist and where for there to be
*  speech to even be consumed. Right.
*  And there was no place before he took over Twitter.
*  And that's the thing that the pendulum, the shift that we're talking about,
*  where it's like you have these pieces that came out that we thought were news.
*  Now we see them as hit pieces. Right.
*  I think kids that are growing up with all this information and disinformation
*  and misinformation, all this shit, I think that for us,
*  it's a little bit more difficult.
*  But for them, they will have the ability to discern and understand that they have
*  to do a little bit more research. Yeah. I think it's we get caught victim of it.
*  Like like old women, when they get a phone call from some Nigerian prince
*  and they need that's us with news now.
*  And we're like, wait a minute, fake things can exist. Right.
*  But I think the kids are going to grow up going, oh, yeah, everything's fake.
*  You just got to do some more research and figure it out.
*  Yeah. That's my hope.
*  Well, enough kids listen to podcasts, which is what really bothers people.
*  That they're getting their information from people like us.
*  Well, they have to. People like us don't have to lie.
*  Yeah. We have zero incentive to lie.
*  Yeah. And when we're talking about these things, like this is what I know.
*  Yeah. This is these. These are the facts.
*  This is real. You're being fucked.
*  You're being lied to.
*  And it's not like there's not a motivation.
*  Look at the amount of money they're making by fucking you.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's this insane sum of money that's involved in a lot of these decisions.
*  Yeah. These decisions roll on whether or not we complain or not.
*  But at least it kind of puts things in check.
*  Maybe that's the solution.
*  Just show how much money people are making.
*  Yeah. Show how much money CNN makes from the pharmaceutical industry.
*  And then you will look at every story about pharmaceuticals through that lens.
*  Brought to you by Pfizer.
*  Anderson Cooper. They do it like right in your face.
*  In your face. Brought to you by Pfizer.
*  The vaccines are perfect. Let's go to a commercial.
*  Yeah. Brought to you by Pfizer.
*  You will not get this virus.
*  You will not transmit this virus.
*  The virus stops with you.
*  And no one complains.
*  Now, do you think that the people that are disseminating the information
*  are aware of the bullshit or they are the useful idiots?
*  Meaning like...
*  I think at a certain point in time, they must be aware.
*  And if they're aware, they're evil.
*  They're trapped. They're trapped.
*  Because I think initially, most people did think that the vaccines were going to work.
*  And it doesn't have to be vaccines. It can be anything.
*  But once you're pushing out information that you know to be false.
*  Right. And you're potentially hurting people.
*  Right. It doesn't have to be vaccines. It can be anything.
*  Right. Now you're evil.
*  That's evil. That's evil.
*  Yeah. I don't fault someone who's maybe ignorant
*  or a useful idiot or really passionate about a thing.
*  But the person that knows. Right.
*  And still puts it out.
*  But you have plausible deniability because you're you're using
*  the opinion of the air quotes experts that are sanctioned.
*  And so they will tell you things and you will say things
*  and you will read articles that support that.
*  And you will go, oh, this is a fact.
*  Not if you're motivated by the agenda of your sponsors.
*  Like if you know that you have to have a certain opinion on the platform
*  and that opinion is based on the people who are paying to sponsor the show.
*  Right. You you are aware.
*  But that's also supported by these experts.
*  But like, you know, so you but since you're not.
*  But right. Since you're not an expert and you're a talking head on CNN.
*  Yeah. Your job is to say, but do you understand that the CDC has disagreed?
*  The FDA has said this is not approved.
*  The the the the NIH has shown to various studies this is not correct.
*  Yeah. And you can say that.
*  And you'd be accurate. Yeah.
*  You would be accurate as the news person on CNN.
*  That's telling a lie.
*  You have your justification so you can go home and sleep at night.
*  And a lot of them don't even do any digging.
*  They're there reading their job.
*  They read the teleprompter.
*  They're fucking gambling on sports betting or some.
*  Who knows what the fuck they're doing with their spare time.
*  But we're just assuming these people are truth tellers.
*  They're not. Yeah. We're assuming they're even journalists.
*  They're not. Yeah.
*  Some of them are.
*  But most of them are just talking heads.
*  So maybe these people that are good at reading.
*  That's the transition that we're going through right now is just because someone
*  giving us information on a news platform with a ticker does not mean that they
*  know anything that they're talking about.
*  It doesn't mean that it's necessarily true.
*  Not only that, we are sure they are highly motivated by money.
*  Yeah. Highly motivated.
*  Yeah. Sponsored by money.
*  Put in position by money.
*  Yeah. The commercials.
*  It's all money, money, money, money, money, money making that money.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And no one's listening.
*  That's what's crazy.
*  But isn't that a beautiful thing?
*  It is a beautiful thing.
*  That means the people know and the people will seek out the information
*  that they deem truthful.
*  Yes, there's going to be some wackos and seeing about the seek out the most extreme
*  versions. Yes, that's us sometimes because it's really fun.
*  I want to indulge in all the conspiracies. It's awesome.
*  It's fun. But at the end of the day, when I have to make a real decision.
*  Right. I'm going to seek out the information.
*  Right. I'm going to read as many things as possible.
*  If it's my life on the line or my kids life on my friend's life on the line,
*  I'm going to actually go out there and figure it out.
*  Hopefully. And the thing is, if it's not for a few brave people that stand up
*  and tell you the truth, how do you if it OK, if there's no
*  Peter McCullough, if there's no Robert Malone, if there's no R.F.K. Junior,
*  Malone is the if there's no Pierre Corey, if there's none of these people that stand
*  up and lose like a sizable portion of their income, their careers get destroyed,
*  their reputations get dragged to the mud, hit pieces get written about them.
*  If it wasn't for these people that stand up and do that.
*  Yeah. And I never would have imagined in my wildest dreams
*  that I would get sucked into that.
*  What do you mean?
*  I never thought that I would get sucked into something like that,
*  where people would be like lying about me.
*  But when you watch it, like on CNN, just function of power,
*  dude, out lying.
*  But it's wild. Yeah.
*  And the dumbest lie. Yeah.
*  Like, bitch, do you think I'm taking horse medicine?
*  You don't think I know like really good doctors that are telling me what to take?
*  Yeah. And how about the fact that I got better quick?
*  That doesn't freak you out at all.
*  Yeah. I got better real quick.
*  Oh, you were so happy at that when that shit kicked.
*  Was it 48 hours that it was? Yeah.
*  Yeah. Like three days later, after I was sick, I made that video and I was fine.
*  Yeah. Three days after that, I did 10 rounds on the bag.
*  Six days in, I did 10 rounds in the bag.
*  I'm like, let's see how I feel.
*  I worked out five days in. I felt pretty good.
*  I said, all right, tomorrow, let's get after it.
*  And I did 10 fucking rounds on the bag.
*  Full clip. No problems. Yeah.
*  No problems. No lack of energy.
*  I felt 100 percent six days later. Yeah.
*  100 percent. Yeah.
*  But I'm on top of my fucking health all day long, all year round.
*  Yeah. I'm always in shape.
*  I always take vitamins. I'm always eating well.
*  Yeah. I sleep good.
*  I do a lot of things. Yeah.
*  Like you can't say that everyone has to adhere to the rules of this thing.
*  When you're lying about the results, you're lying about the studies,
*  you're you're influencing all these talking heads to say these things
*  that turn out to not even be remotely true.
*  Not only that, there's no studies behind it.
*  They had to admit when they were speaking in front of whatever it was in the UK
*  that they never even tested these drugs for transmission.
*  They just tested them to see if they created the antibodies.
*  And then all that other stuff they said was bullshit.
*  Yeah, that's the tricky thing about like making rules for 300 million people
*  is that 300 million people are not the same.
*  The way that you take care of your body is completely different
*  than some asshole that's a consultant.
*  He's sitting at his fucking desk all day, wears 300 pounds.
*  And that rules. It's like an SAT.
*  Like we have to find a way to judge intellect so that kids can go to school or not.
*  There's some kid who flunked the SATs, who's a fucking genius.
*  And he's going to go out there and make money.
*  He's just bored with these things. He doesn't pay any attention.
*  It's what you focus on.
*  You could you could be a very smart person who doesn't study.
*  Yeah. And you take classes and you fucking bomb in your classes.
*  You suck. Yeah. Because you don't know what you're talking about.
*  But if you ask that dude how to fucking fix a turbocharger,
*  that dude knows how to reengineer things. Yeah.
*  You know, this is the problem. It's in the valves.
*  We have to fix the valves.
*  You know, like there's people that are genius at things that they're interested in.
*  Yeah. But if you keep them in a classroom, they're bored of shit and feed them
*  fucking dull ass teachers that spoon feed them shit that they're never going to use.
*  They're not going to they're not going to thrive. Yeah.
*  Yeah. How do you create systems so that these people can thrive?
*  Well, you got to have freedom. That's a big one.
*  You know, freedom is one of the massive factors
*  in this country's ability to churn out innovators. Yeah.
*  There's so much freedom to do things, freedom to try things.
*  I love that it's part of the identity that we feel entitled to it.
*  Yeah. If you restrict it, I'm furious and other people are furious.
*  But that's not every country where they feel entitled to their freedom. Right.
*  Well, that's a big thing about Texas. Texas.
*  It's it's built into the fiber of the human beings that established this place.
*  But that's why you need Texas. You need Florida.
*  I don't care if you don't like it.
*  You need somebody pulling us in that direction.
*  Because it's going to take L.A. or it's going to take New York.
*  It's going to pull them a little bit that way.
*  When we see people partying, having fun during fucking Corona in Texas
*  and in Florida, we're like, well, maybe we can go out to eat.
*  What's going on? Right.
*  But if everybody's locked in and there was nobody else, everyone's going to die.
*  You remember, I remember when Governor Abbott opened up things
*  and they were like, what are you doing?
*  You're going to kill everyone. Yeah.
*  Nope. Nope, it didn't.
*  Did you talk to him? Yeah. And.
*  Did you ask him if he was ever scared of that decision?
*  Because if that decision backfires, that's his.
*  He did it based on science.
*  He did it based on what we know about the disease.
*  You know, protect the same thing that Florida said.
*  Protect the vulnerable.
*  You know, yeah, if you are an old person with a severely compromised immune system,
*  you should get vaccinated.
*  You should be protected.
*  You should probably isolate.
*  It's just a brave decision.
*  There's a lot weighing on that.
*  Yeah. Well, there's a lot of people here that wanted that decision, though, too,
*  especially because he's a Republican.
*  You know, most of the Republicans want the businesses back open.
*  Most of the people like, hey, what do you like?
*  You're taking away people's ability to make decisions.
*  And you're giving the government an unprecedented power that it never had before.
*  Yeah. The government, the mayors never had the ability to shut down all the restaurants.
*  Yeah. What?
*  And when they did that in L.A., they had no effect whatsoever on their check.
*  Their paycheck remained the same.
*  Same no matter what. Yeah.
*  I think you want to make fucking cities great.
*  Have it so that the mayor's salary is based on how well the city does.
*  Oh, now what is now Steelman, the opposition argument?
*  Well, the government would co-opt it.
*  And then these financial institutions would co-opt it.
*  And they would figure out a way to build businesses up unethically.
*  This is the best way to make more money is to pay people less.
*  So you would have lower income wages, lower minimum wages.
*  That's where it gets tricky.
*  It's like you go through this in New York, especially when you have like an apartment
*  or something like that.
*  And you've got to go through all this bureaucracy when you're renovating your apartment.
*  That being said, what I do to my apartment affects the person downstairs,
*  upstairs to the left, to the right.
*  So we have way more rules because we need them.
*  Because what I do fucks everybody else's life, potentially.
*  Drill holes in the wall and get a leaky fucking pipe and people try to do it.
*  Oh, yeah. If they know you got a drop ceiling, they're trying to drop pipes into your fucking ceiling.
*  You don't even see it. Really?
*  This is yes, all the fucking time.
*  So they're like, oh, can I get access to your place and probe a wall to see something?
*  And they'll drop a fucking all their plumbing so they don't have to raise their floor.
*  There's things that they'll take advantage of their neighbor.
*  And because of that, you've got to create all these extra rules.
*  And it's a real fuck to go through.
*  Now, when you have three acres of land in, you know, Texas,
*  you can build a barn without people really looking at it that much.
*  Because you're not affecting your neighbor.
*  So I do get why in certain places you need a little bit more
*  of a bureaucracy because people will take advantage of each other.
*  Yeah. So that does make sense.
*  You can't have all the same rules for all the same places.
*  Yeah. It's not going to work.
*  Yeah, it's not going to work. Yeah.
*  But that's one of the cool things about this country is basically like a bunch of countries.
*  Exactly like Europe.
*  Like France is different than Germany, but they're all
*  what is when they were pushed up next to each other.
*  But when they were putting it together, they built it with that idea.
*  They're like, hey, listen, if I'm up in Maine, it takes me on horseback
*  for months to get to fucking Washington, D.C.
*  Why should your rules affect my rules? Right.
*  Let me do my thing. You do your thing.
*  We'll agree on 10 fucking rules.
*  And then let's have some fun. States rights.
*  There we go. Yeah. And it makes sense.
*  It doesn't make sense.
*  It makes sense that you gravitate towards places that fit with your liking,
*  which is why you're here.
*  Yeah. Psychopaths moved to Portland.
*  Like
*  for real. Yeah.
*  Like one thing I imagine like being born there, but like willingly going.
*  Yeah, that's my people. Yeah, that's a little bit.
*  Fifteen face piercings and you're on your way raining every day.
*  Yeah. Oh, I want to be depressed. Yeah. Let's go.
*  The Oregon Trail. What idiots. I'm looking forward to camping. Yeah.
*  Imagine going across the whole country and fucking one of those little
*  covered wagons covered wagons and then getting to Portland.
*  And you're like, well, for this.
*  Yeah. Rains every day.
*  It's beautiful, though.
*  It's gorgeous. Green. Yeah.
*  Portland's gorgeous. And parts of Oregon are fantastic.
*  Yeah. You know where Kam lives?
*  Kam lives out in like Springfield, that area.
*  Oh, Cameron Haines. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Beautiful. Yeah.
*  Beautiful out there.
*  That's the thing about Oregon, too, is like you have Portland, but everything else is red.
*  Yeah. It was just like Portland just dominates the politics.
*  That's usually how it is.
*  Centers. Yeah, it's all ranchers and farmers and. Yeah.
*  And then I was like the liberal cities that are in the very conservative states
*  are a reaction to how conservative the state is.
*  So they're like the most liberal.
*  Well, they're generally around education institutions.
*  Oh, so they're built around the university.
*  The idea is from the university.
*  Eugene's very liberal. Got it.
*  It's around the universities there.
*  Universities affect the like Boulder, Boulder, Colorado.
*  Perfect one. University of Boulder is right there.
*  It's fucking every university, Colorado. Everybody's liberal. Right.
*  They're all hippies up there because it's all like the city itself
*  sort of like revolves around the education institutions.
*  And the culture of the education institution dictates the culture of the city.
*  Sure. Sure.
*  Yeah, that's why New York, I think, is so unique is everybody
*  thinks that we're like this super like liberal city.
*  And it's like we it's a money city. Yeah.
*  Money wins in New York. In the Manhattan.
*  Yeah, it's a lot of it's the financial business.
*  But if you go to Long Island, that's very red.
*  That's I think even Manhattan is red.
*  Like all these these we're open when it comes to like gay stuff.
*  Right. We love our gays.
*  They create great cultural institutions within the city.
*  You like going to Broadway. You like seeing musical theater.
*  Right. They offer a lot.
*  You like the art. You're coming to New York for art.
*  They offer so much.
*  So we're like, yeah, those guys are dope. Kick it.
*  That's awesome. A lot of gay chefs, a lot of gay artists.
*  Gays kill in New York. Yeah.
*  And they create a lot for us. And we really appreciate it.
*  It's amazing. And but when it comes to actual like the rules,
*  New York is kind of conservative.
*  Like we've had conservative mayors.
*  But Bloomberg wasn't some fucking like bleeding heart liberal.
*  He's a money dude. Right.
*  He just came in. He's like, yo, if we can't pay for it, I'll pay for you.
*  Pay me back. And we're like, I like this guy.
*  This is fucking Bruce Wayne. Right.
*  You know, so yeah, I think the perception of New York is a little weird.
*  A little off. I didn't go any further in politics.
*  No charisma. Is that what it is?
*  Yeah. New Yorkers, we don't care about charisma with the mayors, really.
*  We don't even know who our politicians are.
*  Like I just found out we have a female governor.
*  I had no fucking clue who the governor is.
*  That lays out the lunch. I have no clue.
*  But New Yorkers, we don't care.
*  It's the mayor of New York City is the governor of the state.
*  In our minds. Right. Right. That's the leader.
*  We just don't like you tell you're saying what's going on here.
*  And that's all that matters. Right. We're very. Yeah.
*  Yeah. That's the only thing we really think about is the city. Yeah.
*  What is it? What is it like there now with the immigrants?
*  So here's the thing.
*  New York is so diverse, you can't tell immigrants are there.
*  Does that make sense? Right.
*  Like if there's other cities that are like really homogenous, they're all white.
*  And then all of a sudden, a bunch of not white people come.
*  You're like, oh, my God, we got immigrants everywhere.
*  But for a New Yorker to be like, I think we got some immigrants here.
*  It's impossible. Right.
*  Everybody's an immigrant.
*  Everybody's brown. Everybody's black.
*  Everybody's Asian. Like there's all these different ones. Right.
*  The tricky thing with you're talking about the migrant crisis.
*  Yes. Is that they're taking advantage of a New York is like the biggest state
*  in the country. It's like I think maybe the only big city
*  that has a right to shelter. Right.
*  It's the only one of this size that has a right to shelter.
*  It used to be for homeless people. It's only for homeless people. Yeah.
*  They're taking advantage of a system is built for homeless people,
*  which is pretty fucking good.
*  If you ask me, when you have the financial hub of the world,
*  you want people sleeping on the streets.
*  You go, no, let's put some money so they can go inside like this.
*  And homeless people are supposed to like basically enter in and out of homelessness.
*  The idea is give them some shelter.
*  Maybe they can get back out on their feet. Right.
*  The migrants hear about this and they're like, what?
*  Free housing? Let's get up there. Right.
*  So they're taking advantage of a system that is not for them.
*  And I think when New Yorkers have kind of learned that, they're like,
*  oh, this is this is there's something unethical about this. Yeah.
*  And I think that's where a lot of the pushback is happening.
*  But in terms of like visually being able to see it,
*  it's not something that New Yorkers notice. Right. We just can't.
*  The news makes it seem like it is. Right.
*  We see the article. Oh, this guy beats up the police or something.
*  Like that. But in terms of when you're walking down the street,
*  it is not detectable.
*  So unless you're near one of these places like the Roosevelt Hotel
*  that they've converted, it's the Roosevelt.
*  It's great. Like the one that's right across the street from from Madison Square
*  Garden. You know, the hotel. Yeah.
*  I couldn't believe they converted the whole thing. It's an iconic hotel.
*  It was in that fucking Jennifer Lopez movie. Oh, yeah. She works.
*  She's the maid. She's the maid. Yeah. Yeah. So.
*  But this is like a hotel. We all know. We see it after every Knicks game.
*  It's like you can't fathom that the whole hotel. Yeah.
*  So and also that system that was set up for the homeless
*  was already operating at capacity.
*  And then you increase the amount of migrants into the city by 50 percent.
*  I think it went up 50 percent in the last couple of years.
*  Of course, there's going to be this insane overflow and it just can't handle it.
*  Nuts. It just can't handle it.
*  But they're taking advantage of something that's not for them.
*  So I understand the frustration about it.
*  But is there any kind of pushback to try to stop to that? 100 percent.
*  What are they doing? Nothing.
*  Everybody's everybody's doing what benefits them.
*  And then the politicians are shrewd like Adams is shrewd.
*  He told the governor Hokel, I think her name is.
*  He was like, he's like, listen, I think we're going to have to shut down
*  a new recruitment class for the police.
*  We don't have any more money because we got all these migrants.
*  I mean, you guys got to do something about that.
*  You got to give me some more money.
*  He got some more money.
*  He didn't shut down anything.
*  So he got more money and now he's funding everything that he needs to fund.
*  And I don't know if anything is changing.
*  So everybody's playing politics as well.
*  It's it's well, wasn't he involved in some sort of a thing
*  where they were giving the debit cards to the immigrants?
*  Oh, yeah. Legal migrants and 50 Cent called them out.
*  Getting a piece is like, you know, what the hell is going on with this?
*  50 is the best.
*  He's the best. Well, we got to hang with we got to hang with 50 Cent.
*  I only met him once. I met him at the UFC.
*  He was cool as shit.
*  Dude, he back in the day, I interviewed him.
*  Wait, really? Yeah. Yeah. For the UFC.
*  And it was real quick.
*  It was, you know, like he was celebrity sitting, you know, cage side.
*  Bro, he's dude.
*  He goes all in, bro. He goes all in.
*  We hung out in Boston once and he was telling me like hood stories from Queens
*  because he was like really in that life.
*  And it was like blowing my it was like somebody explaining the godfather to you.
*  If you've never saw the movie.
*  You're like, this happens. This is real.
*  Yeah. Just like he's a fucking he's a fucking man.
*  Anyway, he's never been on your show.
*  I want to get him on.
*  I mean, we just connected for the first time when I was doing the shows up in Boston.
*  He was there. He was there as well.
*  And but I want him on.
*  It's a perfect podcast. Oh, dude, he he goes all in.
*  He goes all that shit on the Breakfast Club with him about Diddy, bro.
*  And he's been that way forever. You know that, right?
*  He's like he's like, why is the guy trying to take me shopping?
*  Yeah. What the fuck?
*  What the fuck did he just say?
*  And did you see when Diddy went on?
*  He goes, he goes, I was trying to be nice.
*  He goes, I thought he wanted some clothes.
*  I thought he needed some clothes.
*  That's that's like a subtle jab to that was funny.
*  But a little bit. Yeah.
*  But also, like, I'm going at it is just hilarious.
*  But these one of those dudes where it's like, if you don't like you,
*  I got to hear him out. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I got to hear him out. Yeah.
*  He might know something. Right.
*  He might be onto something.
*  Yeah. He's wild.
*  We got to go to dinner. Yeah.
*  He's wild.
*  I like when they were going after him for some financial support
*  or something like that. I'm bankrupt. Yeah.
*  They all got it.
*  Oh, God. 400 million dollars deal from vitamin water.
*  The next fucking Instagram post has got a Bentley.
*  He's smart. He'll play the system.
*  Yeah. Yeah. He knows how to do it.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's hilarious.
*  Let him write all the articles. Oh, 50s broke.
*  You know, whatever you want.
*  And he's got his dudes from day one with him still.
*  That's something I always think is really cool. Yeah.
*  Like, that's important. Yeah.
*  When you come back to New York, man?
*  I don't know. I'm going to be there for the UFC in Jersey.
*  That's in June, I guess. OK.
*  I'll be there for a little while. OK. Good.
*  You don't miss it at all.
*  Any place you miss? Nope. Not a single place.
*  And I'm not like a miss or kind of a foreign, like a place that you want.
*  I like going to visit places. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I like visiting places.
*  But it's like I love Texas. Yeah.
*  I love being right here. Yeah.
*  Like right away, like right away.
*  I was like, oh, this is it. Yeah. Spot. Yeah.
*  It's a perfect balance for me. I love it. Yeah.
*  I really do. I don't miss.
*  I miss what L.A. used to be.
*  But I think we've done that and more at the mothership.
*  What L.A. was for me was my friends, you know, is the life that I lived,
*  the people that I communicated with all the time.
*  And, you know, the Comedy Store.
*  And you built that out here and we built that out here.
*  And we made it even better.
*  Anything from L.A. that you still want to bring out?
*  Besides Joey Diaz, the joys in New Jersey, but Joey's been coming out.
*  But he's from L.A. for you.
*  Yeah, he's a fellow.
*  But, you know, Joey was sick of it before anybody was. Yeah.
*  Joey was sick of it before anybody was. Yeah. You know,
*  when I left the Comedy Store in 2000,
*  2007, Joey was like, good, fuck that place.
*  He was Joey's a burn the bridges kind of guy.
*  He doesn't give a fuck. Yeah. You know.
*  And he was the first guy to like,
*  I think he moved to Jersey early on, man, like right around the time
*  I was moving to Texas, he was moving to Jersey.
*  He's like, I'm getting the fuck out of here. Yeah.
*  I was trying to get him to come out here, but he wasn't interested.
*  He loves Jersey.
*  But I think he'll eventually come out here. There we go.
*  Yeah. He loved it when he was here, man.
*  We had him out here for three days and got him out here for 420 weekend out here.
*  Nice. And, you know, when he's out here, it's like he misses the hang.
*  He misses being around comics, misses the green room.
*  How was the energy in the green room when he was phenomenal?
*  It was just such a party on fire, such a party.
*  And everybody was like, dude, I feel like Joey just belonged there.
*  Like he just sat down in the green room and he was like, he's always been here.
*  Yeah, he kind of always has been here. That sign.
*  Get it together, bitch. That's on the wall.
*  That's Joey. Yeah. That's what he always used to say.
*  You get ready to go on stage like, get it together, bitch.
*  And like it was just it was like that meant the party was about to jump off.
*  Yeah. So to have that neon sign in the green room, the spirit of Joey has always been there.
*  That's that's that's your last Avenger, bro.
*  You get that together. He's the Hulk.
*  Yes. You call him in.
*  You call him in when you got a problem. Yeah. Yeah.
*  He's been murdering on stage, too.
*  He hasn't lost a beat. Hasn't lost a beat. Yeah.
*  Does he go up in Jersey?
*  He goes up, goes over a couple of times a week just to keep the dust off of it.
*  Yeah. But when he came here, he was he was tuned in.
*  Really? He was ready to go. Oh, my God.
*  It was hilarious.
*  I'll tell you some of the shit you say.
*  He's so crazy.
*  He's so wild.
*  I don't want to give up his bits, but oh, my God, he's so wild.
*  Yeah. He's so fun, man.
*  And it's always fun. It's fun with him.
*  Everything's fun. Yeah. Everything is good times.
*  Everybody gets hugs. He loves you.
*  Tells everybody loves him. Yeah.
*  He's just he's the party.
*  Now, he's fantastic, man. Yeah.
*  His stories.
*  I remember when he came on on the pot, I mean, his his story is just being in
*  Colorado. Those stories. Oh, yeah.
*  It's a it's a movie like you're watching a movie in your head.
*  Just this mook just fucking walking around Colorado, taking advantage of all these
*  dumb idiots. They're like, oh, the trees are green.
*  He's like, oh, I'm going to take all of their money.
*  Like, it's just amazing.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And the fact that he gets in the standup comedy and he's just he's just such a
*  character, man. There's no there's no Joey Diaz other than him.
*  I don't know anybody like him. Yeah.
*  You get real lucky in this this world that we live in that you get to be
*  close to these exceptional human beings.
*  Yeah. It is different.
*  It is different than anybody else. You know, you collect a lot of these guys.
*  I've noticed. Yeah.
*  Like a lot of your friends, they're they're like the
*  they're these unique personalities, especially the non comics.
*  But they're they're these like kind of misfits that I've noticed.
*  Like even your buddy was a Tommy who plays Poole.
*  Like every one of your guys that I meet, like within 15 minutes, they're telling me
*  a story that like just blows my fucking mind.
*  Yeah. And it's yeah, it's really interesting.
*  They're unique in this in in their own right.
*  But they are these characters that should be in movies.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. It's a cultivation of extraordinary humans.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Life's more fun that way.
*  Yeah. They it makes your life richer.
*  You enjoy it. Yeah.
*  And when they win, you win. Everybody wins.
*  Yeah. It's all everybody's having a good time.
*  Yeah. And that's possible.
*  That could be done. Yes.
*  Yeah. It's just but you have to cultivate the same way you cultivate a garden.
*  Yeah. And you got to root it out, too.
*  Yeah. Have some bad apples in there.
*  Yeah. Get them out. Yeah.
*  Get them out. Yeah. That's that can be tricky times.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I miss Joey. I got to call Joey.
*  He'll be out here soon.
*  Yeah. I got to drag him into the city.
*  I wish he could. I mean, he's kind of far like, you know, where is he in like Cherry Hill or something like that?
*  Right. He's in like down down there.
*  Yeah. So he's not like a come in for an hour from the city.
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's the thing.
*  It's an hour. If he's 20 minutes, then, you know.
*  Yeah. He does a lot of Jersey rooms.
*  He'll do the stress factory. Yeah.
*  Fuck around down there. Yeah.
*  Do a lot of a lot of, you know, local gigs.
*  You know, there's gigs now.
*  There's a lot of places you could work.
*  Just to fuck around. Just keep the dust off.
*  Yeah. You know.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Him coming on was just fucking great.
*  Yeah. We're lucky we know all these people, man.
*  We're very lucky.
*  There's there's people out there that don't have any exceptional people in their life.
*  And they live through these conversations that we have with those people vicariously.
*  Yeah. Because those people become a part of their life, too.
*  Like, oh, shit, shoulders on. And they get excited.
*  I will say that's the cool thing about people knowing you from podcasting
*  is that they probably know more about your life than like even some of your friends do.
*  Oh, yeah. They're hanging out with you for hours a week.
*  So when they meet you, they're meeting this person they know a lot about.
*  Not this character from a TV show that is not reflective of you at all.
*  Right. You're not Ross from Friends. Right. Right. Right.
*  Because Ross might be completely different than Ross from Friends. Right.
*  And I can understand, like, why you might resent people loving you for a character
*  you play when you know you're not that character.
*  But if people appreciate you for what you do, either in stand up or even podcasting
*  or whatever, it's like they're appreciating this thing you really care about
*  and a true version of yourself. Yes.
*  So so the love feels worth it.
*  You know, it feels just so why it's very difficult to to like cast someone
*  in an unfavorable light that people already know.
*  Like like the Huberman thing, we try to take a distorted version of that person
*  and say, this is who they really are.
*  He talks to them four hours a week.
*  Yeah. They're not going to change the way that they feel about him.
*  He also talks to other people like you or me, where we're fucking around,
*  joking around, you get to see the real him. Yeah.
*  You know, it's not just the distribution of information.
*  It's also like, this is the guy. Yeah. This is who he is. Yeah.
*  He's going to be OK. Oh, he's be better than ever. Yeah.
*  Yeah, he's fine. Yeah.
*  And it's good that people see
*  it's good that people see that he's at a position where they want to attack him.
*  Yeah. I mean, is he doing something good?
*  Well, he's a target.
*  And if you're popular and famous, you're a target.
*  And if you're going to be the type of person that goes after those people,
*  that's like that's a dark path.
*  It's not a good path.
*  And you become a target, too. They find you.
*  Well, that's yeah.
*  Like, yeah, what we were saying is I think it's important
*  that when these people are writing these clearly biased hit pieces,
*  that they're also recognized for what they've done. Yeah.
*  And the world will see that if you put out something like this,
*  there is a cost. Yeah. You're not doing it with impunity.
*  It's also there's a cost in your own mind.
*  You know what you did? These motherfuckers, I don't think they care.
*  I think they do and they don't.
*  I think they think they can do it because they're supposed to do it
*  because that's their job.
*  But I think once the impact comes back their way, they're like,
*  I don't want to pay this price. Yeah. The blowback is awful.
*  And that blowback stays on you.
*  It doesn't people Google that for years to come.
*  They'll know when you write something else.
*  I never trust anything you put out again.
*  This is yeah.
*  And then they'll dig into your past, man.
*  They'll find some things that you did.
*  They'll find some people that are upset at you.
*  You know, and it's also it's just like negative energy.
*  You're putting out negative energy.
*  People that build people up, people that build people up
*  through their own version of reality that they're writing about
*  and they're inspiring people and they're they're they're giving people hope
*  and they're giving people something positive.
*  That's a great blow.
*  The the the response to that is like this beautiful thing
*  that everybody's helping everybody advance through this bizarre existence.
*  Yeah. But if you're the person that's just always knocking people down,
*  always attacking, you live in that negative space. Yeah.
*  Even like, dude, when I had that whole thing with Mencia, yeah,
*  even that, which I knew, A, had to be done and B,
*  I was one of the only people that was in a position where I could do it.
*  And even though I did experience, I experienced a lot of blowback,
*  even career blowback, I lost my agency.
*  I got banned from the store.
*  And even me at the time who was doing well
*  knew that like, oh, this is why people don't do this,
*  because this is the real reaction to someone
*  that that steps up and says something about something that has to be said.
*  But even the like the negative shit that I would get is back in the
*  I read the comments days, the negative response from his fans.
*  It was awful. Yeah, it was awful.
*  You don't want that in your life.
*  Even though I knew it was the right thing to do.
*  I remember saying to myself, like, I'm not going to get involved in one of these again.
*  Wow. I'm done with this. Wow.
*  This is this is gross. Yeah.
*  It's like you're you're at the center point of this
*  nasty, negative thing.
*  Yeah. And even though for the art form, it was positive. Yep.
*  Like the negative, negative, negativity that I experienced,
*  even though it was overwhelmingly positive, just the small amount of negativity
*  so absorbing is not worth it.
*  Yeah. It felt bad for a long time.
*  I didn't like it.
*  And I didn't even like all the people that were constantly and consistently attacking him.
*  I don't like it. I don't like any of it.
*  I don't like that every time he makes a comment, like every time you post something,
*  did you steal that? Yeah.
*  So they're like, you're you.
*  You've opened the door to the lowest version of the vibration that humans give,
*  which is attacking, breaking you down.
*  Very I can kick you because you're down. Yeah.
*  And they just kick him.
*  And, you know, in a lot of ways, he deserves it because that's what he did.
*  That was his legacy. That's what he did.
*  He stole material from comedians and created a career off of the back
*  of other people's work. Yeah.
*  And in every other business, that's theft. Yeah.
*  And every other business, you know, you get penalized.
*  You go to court. If it's music, you lose all your money. Yep.
*  And in this one, for whatever reason, our business,
*  people don't take intellectual copyright as nearly as seriously.
*  It's not. Yeah. Jokes are thought of as like not an important thing.
*  Yeah. It's not like literature.
*  It's not like plagiarism.
*  It's not as we pay the bills with this. Yeah.
*  This is what we do. And it's how we feed our families.
*  And it is creative work. Yes. Difficult to do.
*  It takes hours. It takes months. It takes years.
*  Some bits takes forever to construct to make them really good.
*  Rattle them off. Yeah.
*  There's some bits that, you know, they just they they require years
*  of like hammering that steel and sharpening that blade.
*  Yeah. That takes forever.
*  I think that's the best metaphor for it.
*  It is sharpening a blade, banging away at it constantly.
*  And you're doing it wrong.
*  You got to correct it. You're doing it right.
*  You got to remember it. Yeah.
*  Yeah. You got to go over the recordings.
*  You got to sit down with the notes.
*  Step away. Come back a couple of months.
*  Well, OK, this is exciting.
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
*  But yet to take something, somebody's work like that is infuriating.
*  But it's a it's a really interesting perspective to have for you
*  to even look back at that and and find empathy for him.
*  Oh, I definitely have empathy for him.
*  I have empathy for everybody.
*  And people that make horrible mistakes like like he did for so long.
*  I have empathy for him.
*  And it's the trap that he's in because he won't admit it either is the worst.
*  That's the worst. Wait a minute. To this day?
*  Yeah, he won't admit it.
*  So he's trapped.
*  He's trapped in this justification that nobody believes.
*  And he tries to spin a spin a tale that nobody believes
*  because the truth is the only thing that will set you free. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And the problem with those people and there's a bunch of them,
*  and we know quite a few of them, is there are people
*  that start their career stealing. Yeah.
*  And they do really well and they kill it.
*  And then they get exposed and then they have to write their own shit.
*  And it doesn't add up.
*  Oh, boy, that drop off.
*  Oh, boy, is that drop off substantial. Yeah.
*  There are people that had initial specials that were bangers.
*  And then after that initial special, everything after that is hot dog shit.
*  Now they got to do the work.
*  Now they have to do the work. They don't know how to do it.
*  They don't understand the language they're speaking.
*  It's basically like speaking French, but you don't know what the words mean.
*  But you say, Paulez-vous français?
*  And everybody's like, amazing. Yeah.
*  Yeah. You don't know what the fuck you're saying.
*  You spoke French in a movie. Yeah.
*  And they gave you all the lines and you did the lines.
*  And everybody's like, this person is fluent in French.
*  And now you've got to go to Paris and walk around.
*  And people are speaking to you in French.
*  Yeah. I don't understand a fucking word anybody's saying.
*  The language of comedy, too, is something that you you
*  the type of mindset that would make a person steal someone's bit
*  and do it verbatim on stage is the exact opposite mindset of a creative person.
*  Because you want to do the different thing.
*  You want to do the unique thing.
*  You don't have to take nobody else has. Right. Yes.
*  Which is the banger.
*  Yeah. You go, well, hold on.
*  Yeah. What about that?
*  There was like, wow.
*  Yeah. Who told them that?
*  How come that just fucking stop being an issue?
*  Yeah. The beautiful thing about a joke is that like it always is existing.
*  The great ones are always existing right in front of us.
*  Yeah. And we just haven't grabbed on it.
*  So when somebody says it, you're like, you mother fucker.
*  Exactly. How did I not?
*  Exactly. It's that that's the best feeling when someone has a bit.
*  You're like, why didn't I think of that? Yeah.
*  That's the best feeling.
*  Oh, when someone comes up to you and goes, yeah.
*  Oh, my God, that is so good.
*  And it can be simple. Yeah.
*  It can be such a simple.
*  But that requires it.
*  You you're not thinking about yourself.
*  Yeah. You're thinking about the work, the thing, the piece that you're working on.
*  When you're a person thinks about themselves like, I'm going to kill by saying these things.
*  Yeah. And I'm going to get this.
*  Yeah. It's you're literally like blocking creativity.
*  Yeah. And so then when they have to be creative, it's terrible.
*  They just never learned.
*  They don't. They don't spend the time in the gym.
*  They don't know how to lift the weights.
*  They just don't know what it is.
*  And they're pretending they're black belt.
*  Yeah. They're out there pretending to be a black belt with all the confidence of a black belt.
*  But they got bullshit moves.
*  Yeah. And they get knocked out.
*  Yeah. They get fucked up.
*  No, that does happen.
*  Yeah. And it's yeah.
*  It's like it's hilarious when you see a really bad special from a known thief.
*  Yeah. The language.
*  Some of them, they'll still step on premises that they know other people have done.
*  And it still sucks because they can't steal anymore.
*  The language is the best way of putting it.
*  Yeah. It's like, you don't understand the language.
*  Of comedy. Yeah, it is a fuck.
*  And that's something I wonder, like the people who start really young,
*  like, you know how, like when you learn a language young, yeah, you have a way greater
*  aptitude for it and there's a fluency and a comfort within it.
*  Whereas if you try to learn a language at like 40, maybe it's just not going to be as like you can memorize vocabulary.
*  You can do all these things just a little bit harder for you to be.
*  Well, you don't have the resources because you don't have like when you're 40, you have bills and family and obligations.
*  Things that are bothering you all day long.
*  Yeah. When you're 15 or 12,
*  you don't have any of those problems.
*  You have a few problems with friends.
*  You don't have any bills.
*  Foods on there are available every night.
*  You're not worrying about how the electric stays on.
*  Oh, yeah. You're free.
*  You don't get the Internet's on.
*  I've typed in. Explore. Yeah.
*  You're free. You have so little resources that are being allocated to all these different things.
*  Yeah. That when you're a person, you have a family and a mortgage.
*  Yeah. Fucking business responsibilities that neighborhood.
*  Yeah. Homeowners Association.
*  Human resources at work and taxes and you have the time to learn French.
*  Yeah. You better learn it before all that.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's much easier if you learn it before all that, because otherwise you're just not going to have the time to obsess about a thing.
*  And the obsession and like.
*  That the purity when you really care about the thing you're talking about,
*  like, I don't know if you've went through times in your in your stand up career where like there wasn't something you wanted to share.
*  Did you ever go through a stretch?
*  Yeah, you have nothing to talk about. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Especially when you're young.
*  Yeah. And it's like or there was times where like I felt like I talked about all the things
*  and I had like a straight before this last hour.
*  I was like, man, what do I want to say?
*  All right. I did the thing about abortion.
*  I've done the thing about trans. I did all the things.
*  I'm like, I don't want to just be grabbing at a topic.
*  I want to really like feel strongly about something.
*  Actually be interested. Exactly.
*  Yeah. And I took like a little bit of time off before I actually felt something.
*  And the funny thing is when you feel strongly about something, it pours out.
*  It's not hard. The jokes might not be good at first, but you can't wait to tell them and figure them out.
*  Right. Try to figure out a joke you don't care about is a job.
*  Yeah. It's not an art. That's a job.
*  Yeah. But when you care and it's fun and exciting and the stakes are fucking high and it could fuck up.
*  Yeah. That I want to get on stage. I can't wait.
*  Yeah. Give me another spot. How do I work?
*  You try to figure it out in real time in front of a group of people.
*  And you have to elicit a specific response from them. It has to be humor.
*  You know, it's so funny is like you ever listen to a recording of like a new bit.
*  And when you were on stage doing it, you're like that crushed.
*  And then when you listen back, you're like, oh, I did okay. But you were just so excited.
*  Yes. That it worked.
*  Yes. That the excitement changed almost the way that you interpreted the crowd.
*  Yes. And I don't know for me, I'm like, oh, that means I really like this.
*  But also that's the problem with old bits. You don't get enthusiastic about it anymore.
*  And the audience doesn't feel the enthusiasm from you.
*  And you're like, why is this not working? Right. It's because you're not working.
*  Because it's not math. Yeah.
*  Some people are doing like word problem jokes. At its core, it's not word problem.
*  It's like those people got to connect to the way you feel about this thing.
*  Exactly. And they'll pick up quick.
*  Exactly. Exactly.
*  And there's ways to trick the system with like Mr. X and all this kind of stuff.
*  But if they can feel, they can sense that deep down, you don't give a fuck.
*  They're not giving it up. And you got guys like Joey is a perfect example.
*  It's like when he's fucking rolling, he feels it.
*  It feels like he is equally passionate about it the first time he said it.
*  And you get caught up. It's becoming a joke.
*  Yeah. It's hypnosis. It is.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Hypnotizing the entire crowd to think the way Joey thinks.
*  Yes. Yeah. Yes.
*  That's what he's doing. You're on like an emotional wavelength.
*  Yes. And yeah, to me, that's like the that's the highest form of it.
*  Obviously, you want to have the structure, you want to have the jokes,
*  you want to have the Mr. X and all these things 100 percent.
*  But to me, I think those are almost like that's like the icing and sprinkles on the cake.
*  The cake is built with how much do I really fucking care about this position?
*  Yes. And sometimes the position is just me being
*  naughty or silly or absurd. It doesn't matter.
*  Yeah. But I got to fucking care about it.
*  Right. Yeah. It has to be important to you.
*  Yeah. And they feel that.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And those are the bits I always remember.
*  They can be the silliest little fucking things like little things Patrice would do about
*  you know, the subway stopping. You saw that one where like, excuse me,
*  someone's just been hit by the subway. There's going to be a delay.
*  And he just he just stands there. And all of a sudden, he like moves his sleeve
*  to look at his watch to see how late he's going to be to work.
*  And it's just this little tiny thing, which is like that's how we would feel.
*  Yeah. Like, yeah, he didn't even need a punchline.
*  It's just like a guy's dead. Turned into jelly on the tracks.
*  He's like 915. Fuck. Yeah.
*  Like, yeah. Yeah.
*  How many of those can I make in my life? Yeah.
*  That's to me. And you always think that when you
*  have a new bit, like this is the last new bit, like I don't have anything else to say.
*  But you'll always have something to say. You just need the time.
*  Yeah. You need the time.
*  You need to think. And again, it needs to be something you're actually interested in.
*  Yeah. So you have to find something
*  you're actually interested in. Yeah.
*  That's the difference between thieves. Like that's why they don't have interest.
*  They have interest in killing. Exactly.
*  They're interested in themselves. How can I succeed?
*  Yeah. How can I win? Yeah.
*  Yeah. And they're usually always tearing down other comedians too.
*  Yeah. Which is always ironic.
*  Well, because they're projecting how they feel about themselves.
*  Yeah. It's fascinating. It's fascinating. But it's also fascinating that there's still a few
*  thieves out there that have managed to like slip through and they're existing around us.
*  We're all aware of them. Like, there's one. There's one.
*  Look at them over there. Why do you think there are more people
*  that don't call them out then? Because there's definitely career
*  implications. Consequences.
*  Yeah. You know, like some of these people wind up being successful and they hire people. That's
*  one of the things they love to do. Thieves will hire a bunch of other thieves when they
*  got a television show. And they'll have thieves like a thief will hire a bunch of comedians,
*  I should say, when they get a television show and they give them work and they support them.
*  And then this is like, then you have a bunch of people that'll defend you.
*  That's very common. And that could be because you're paying them.
*  Exactly. Exactly. Like the thieves will go out and get a bunch of people that maybe they
*  swipe some bits from and they'll put them on their television show. Yeah. I know people have done that.
*  So that's their way of paying for silence. Paying them back. Yeah. Hooking them up,
*  paying them back. I'll give you examples after the show. We don't need to be negative.
*  Talk about people. But there's a bunch of that that I know.
*  But you know, there's also a bunch of people that are killing it that we know are pure.
*  And having this amazing successful run right now because of the internet, because of streaming
*  platforms that are leaning into really good comedy and not comedy that fits a certain narrative.
*  If I look at the people who are having the most success right now, I think it's the people that
*  are pure. There's a lot of that. Yeah. We can talk after, but the people that I see crushing it,
*  the people I'm looking at, and I'm just like, holy shit, this guy deserves it. Shane deserves it.
*  And he's just hilarious. And I'm looking at these people and I'm just like,
*  that could have went a different way. 100%.
*  Like it could have went a really different way. But the structure was set up in a way
*  where he had another opportunity and with his second chance demolished anything that could have
*  stood in his way. And it's like, okay, I look at that and I go, okay, there is some justice in this.
*  It's also like people are in his corner. They want him to succeed.
*  Yeah. Well, when you're good, people want to fight for you.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is a great time for comedy, man. I think it might be the best time
*  ever. I really do. I think this is legitimately the golden age of comedy. And this is also when
*  Ari said it best, he's like, comedy is dangerous now because it's fun because comedy is dangerous
*  again. Yeah. Because there's so many people that want to restrict what people can and can't talk
*  about. That's unique. I feel like the restriction is less now.
*  Really? Yeah. Now, right now, currently. Like in today, I feel like we can kind of say anything.
*  As opposed to like two years ago. Two, five, five to two years. Now you're like,
*  oh shit, this joke is wild to say. Well, it's also people are wanting you to go out there.
*  They get excited. Like when you did that ditty bit. Yeah. Like people wanted you to go out there.
*  They're like, oh, he went right in there. Oh, Jesus Christ. I remember I got to LA a day early and I
*  was trying to like work out some like local stuff because sometimes it's fun to just, you know,
*  you're in a city. Right. And I was at the store and I was bombing my ass off with local shit.
*  Every local joke I tried to do just fucking bombed. And I was like, what the fuck am I going to talk
*  about the forum? Like everything I try. And I thought that they were like aware that like the
*  city was, you know, in a different state than it used to be. And I'm trying to write all these
*  jokes about like what's happened to the city. And people in LA don't really feel the city's changed
*  that much. That's like an outside perspective. So I'm saying it and they're kind of laughing,
*  but they're like, or they're aware and they don't want to admit it. Right. And I remember we just
*  in the green room, I'm just like, fuck, maybe the joke is about ditty. That's the only thing
*  everybody's talking about. That's, that's all it's on our minds. That's what's happening.
*  Yeah. And then bro, this is how funny 50 is. I'll share this.
*  Kenya? Yeah. I'll tell you the full thing after, but I, I got FaceTime from 50 and he's like,
*  he's like, yo, next time he goes, he goes, he goes, he goes, yo, next time I come see you, bro,
*  I'm gonna come out on stage with a Maltese cat.
*  I'm like, bro, you're the craziest motherfucker. Imagine him walking out on a show petting a
*  fucking cat. So do you, what do you think was going on? With who? Meek and Diddy? I don't think,
*  I don't think Meek's gay. I don't think anything's happened with them. I think that was just like a
*  funny rumor that happened. I even said that when I first did the Meek joke, I was like, I don't
*  think he's gay. He just handled the accusations poorly. Yes. Like he just handled them. I love
*  pussy. Who does that? That's the gayest thing. Yeah. But I don't think he's gay. But yeah.
*  But that's just an unsophisticated approach to PR. Yeah. Like his PR team is probably like, hey,
*  maybe don't do that. You've got to do something. Yeah. Yeah. Who knows? I mean, he's probably
*  not consulting with anybody. Yeah. If I had to guess. Nobody consults with you when something
*  happens. You just post whatever you want. Yeah. Yeah. I don't have like a team telling me,
*  don't say that before the podcast. That would be a problem. Yeah, it would be. Yeah. I would have
*  never gotten anywhere. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. We need you to not have a team actually. Yeah. It's actually
*  kind of important. You don't have a bunch of people you consult with about what could be dangerous.
*  Because then who controls them? What are their intentions? Exactly. And what are they doing
*  this based on? You know, self-preservation. Yeah. Yeah. It's just wild that apparently he had cameras
*  in every room of his house. That's what they're saying. Has that been verified? I don't think
*  it's been verified. And I think like the Epstein shit, it never will be. Now, I'm not saying that
*  he's like Epstein. You know, I think he could have some fucking wild parties and cetera. But if he
*  was filming everybody. If he's filming everybody, I understand why Hummer showed up to the house.
*  Because people who went to the parties were like, get those fucking things. Hundreds of hidden
*  cameras discovered in Diddy's homes, lawsuit says. Oh, well then it's, yeah, it's a wrap. Done.
*  Hundreds. Yeah. You will never see any of that footage. This dude had hundreds of cameras. That
*  is so crazy. Because if he's doing wild shit. A court filing, Jones said he worked with Combs
*  between September 22nd and September of 2022 and September of 2023 to produce the rapper's most
*  recent release. So he said hundreds of cameras in his homes in LA, New York and Miami. And did he
*  like to throw the parties? Like he would throw the white party. He'd do. But who's he have taking
*  care of that footage? I mean, you know, you can get people. Wow. You know, powerful dude.
*  He's a powerful dude. And I think he really enjoyed the underage people implicating people in crimes
*  by by bringing underage people to them. And what does that mean? That was the whole thing about the
*  Epstein place is that like, if you've got underage girls and you don't tell these guys these are
*  underage girls and then you get them drugged up, get them drunk, give them coke, whatever it is,
*  and then film them. Yep. Well, they don't even know. They don't know that they're committing acts
*  of pedophilia. Could be or could be they do know and they think it's safe to do it because this
*  guy's protecting them. But meanwhile, they're just coked up and they're getting filmed. Yeah.
*  You know, which is also the theory. Yeah. But it is you got when someone becomes
*  when someone becomes like a wild billionaire character. Yeah. You're like, well, where's the
*  pussy? Yeah. Where's the shit that I got rich for? Imagine you went to the island. The fun. Yeah.
*  I need it. Like, how do I get the fun? And then someone comes along like you need to get connected
*  my friend Jeffrey Epstein. He takes care of everything and he brings the fun. And so you
*  just keep flying to hang out with them. And so that's your party. And you can't go to Vegas and
*  go to Drey's and pick up hoes and get crazy and bring them back to your suite with coke and
*  people talk too much. So here's the thing. It's like these tech guys have made all this money.
*  Right. Right. They made all this money. They're hanging out in Miami or wherever they're hanging.
*  And they're like, I'm a billionaire now. Why am I not getting pussy? I got to connect with some
*  people that can make me the man. I thought I'd be the man. Now I bet in like the CEO world and in
*  that world of country clubs and in sculling bones, there's dudes who know how to get the hookers.
*  Here's the thing. It's not even the skull and bones guys. That's like old wasp shit. I'm talking
*  about the nerd from Silicon Valley. The nerds know prostitutes. The nerds have coke. It's not
*  even the nerds. They have a guy whose it's their job to throw the parties. It's the fissure. Now,
*  you know like these like jet setter crews. My boy was explaining how this thing works to me.
*  They have these like events around the globe that like wealthy people go. Like Davos. Not even
*  Davos. More just like New York Fashion Week and the US Open. All happens around Labor Day in New
*  York. So everybody who comes for money and all these rich socialite people from around the world,
*  they all come to New York for that week. And they go to the nice parties and they do all the things.
*  Tech bros or the crypto bros want to be included in that cool thing. How do they be included? They
*  got to throw the best party. How do you make the best party? You have to have all the models.
*  You have to have the cool people. They don't know any of those. So you get the fixer. The fixers
*  get paid crazy money from the tech bros or crypto bros because they want in on this thing. And you
*  develop a reputation of being the guy who puts on the crazy bashes. Now, once you have that reputation,
*  they think they're in. All these other people who are like the socialite people who come from tons
*  of money and their parents are lords and shit, they look at them like, oh you're paying to play.
*  It's a bringer show for comedy. You're not really selling out Carolines. You did the bringer show.
*  But they don't know that. So they're like, yeah, we're all partying. We're doing the thing. So
*  there's this whole economy that kind of feasts off these people who just have money. But here's the
*  thing. Those people are doing the fixers. They got the models to show up. These models are curating
*  their Instagram by going to these parties around the world. Sometimes they're getting paid to go
*  to the parties. I imagine the models that are more fun, in other words, they get a little loose. They
*  like to party. They like to fuck a little bit. They get invited more. The ones that are less fun,
*  maybe a little bit more tight, they don't get invited as much. So you don't even have to say,
*  yo, you got to fuck these guys. You just want to know if you want to get invited to this nice party
*  in Switzerland. And you start doing a little blow, start doing a little molly. That's what you like
*  to do in the first place. And then you get to party on yachts and you're hanging out with all
*  these guys and maybe they even pay you. Well, they are paying them. Yeah. And everybody's fucking
*  the same girls. It's a lot of money. Like you know the Salt No. Brunei's deal? What is it? Oh my God.
*  Salt No. Brunei, he had his own nightclub. Maybe he still does. So he has like 500 Ferraris. These
*  guys have insane amounts of money because it's not public. So they don't have to be like the world's
*  richest men. Exactly. But they're richer than everybody. They have trillions. And so he had
*  his own nightclub. And so what he would do is he would pay actresses, he would find these girls,
*  get me her. And he would get these gals and give them exorbitant amounts of money to come. And then
*  he would have a nightclub where it was only him. And he would go down there and it's filled with
*  gorgeous women. And he would go down there and just go, you come with me. And then they'd go
*  fucking party. And they were making a lot of money. And one of them was writing a book. And so she had
*  a laptop and she was like documenting what they confiscated her laptop. And then she went back to
*  America that she spilled the beans and she ratted out all the other girls that were doing it. And
*  it kind of fucked up the whole thing. Because like a list people were getting shit tons of money.
*  This thing to go over there. Yeah, my I would say a list but people that you know,
*  yeah, there's like people you know of. And if you go there, you get millions of dollars. Like this
*  lady had gotten millions of dollars in jewelry from him. There's a service that apparently,
*  we're like, I love that word. Yeah, apparently, right? Allegedly. Billionaires can fuck like
*  sports illustrated models and shit. And like Victoria's Secret chicks, chicks that we've seen.
*  And it's cost a lot of money. And they do it because it's like, hey, it's easier than,
*  you know, going to do these shoots. Right. The easiest. They don't want to tell anybody
*  that they did it. And also they're getting to fuck billionaires. They're not fucking some random
*  crackhead. Right. They're gonna already fuck the billionaire. So I might as well make some
*  fucking money doing it. And it exists now. And you know about this? Allegedly? Allegedly, I may know
*  people who have partaken. So it's like, and this exists. Bang, like cover of Maxim. I don't know
*  the cover. I don't know what's going on. Just some hot ladies that you are aware of. But they're not
*  just hot chicks that come from Russia, right? We're talking about famous people that you would
*  never think would even need to do that. Right. These are like the ecosystems that exist out there.
*  Well, it makes sense. If you're worth $200 billion and you give someone a million dollars
*  to fuck you, that is nothing. You make that in five minutes. So I'll never spend. Okay. In 2001,
*  Jeffrey was forced to auction off his personal possessions after using the country as a piggy bank,
*  spending an average of $747,000 a day for 10 years. On top of the $17 billion in gifts
*  to friends and family, the Sultanese true vulgarity was exposed. His brother also treats the company
*  as the country as an ATM. And it remains a crime in Brunei for anyone to ever discuss how the royals
*  spend their money. When you don't work for your money, how can you value it? Like if it just comes
*  right out the ground, like how do you really think? How much was he spending a day?
*  He lives in a palace with 1,788 rooms, 257 bathrooms, five swimming pools, a mosque,
*  a banquet hall that holds 5,000 people and a 110 car garage. When he turned 50, the Sultan built a
*  stadium and invited Michael Jackson to perform in it and paid him $17 million for three concerts.
*  Jeffrey 59 maintains a separate pleasure palace and once owned a 150 foot yacht called the Tits.
*  He named his fenders Nipple One and Nipple Two. And he could never understand why others found
*  that juvenile and crass. Here and abroad, the brothers are infamous for their sex parties and
*  their harems composed mainly of underage girls. Wow. Wild. Bro, that amount of money that he's
*  spending, that is so crazy. $3 billion plus. But that said it didn't include the $17 billion that
*  he was giving out to people. Did you mention the Michael Jackson thing for his birthday?
*  Yeah. Okay. Okay. That did ballin' son. But yeah, these fucking things exist all over the place.
*  Crazy. And it's the easiest money that these girls will ever make. Crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
*  and it's so much, if you've got that much money. It doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean anything.
*  They light it on fire. And the money's coming every day. It's just stacking up,
*  giving someone a million dollars to fuck. And the girl's probably like, wait, a million dollars,
*  just regular sex? You're not going to shit on me? He's not going to give you the Cincinnati top hat
*  or whatever the fuck? Yo, I was asking, because when I was out there in Abu Dhabi, I was like,
*  I'm trying to understand some of the cultural nuances. But I had a joke about it. But I was
*  asking about the Dubai shit. Did you send me that? Or you sent me the, I did a joke out there. Yeah.
*  But they told me that the Burj Khalifa has a separate sewage system because it wasn't
*  connected to the sewage system of Dubai. So they have these poop trucks that take the poop out.
*  And the joke I said is like, well, that's why they have to shit on the hooker's chest,
*  because it's not connected to the plumbing. But they were telling me these interesting cultural
*  things that happen out there, like with the license plates. Have you heard about this?
*  Yes. Where the lower the number, the more expensive it is. Yeah, crazy expensive.
*  Yeah, millions of dollars for a number three license plate. I'm like, why is that? And one of
*  the kids who's from the royal family goes, you have to understand, when everybody has a G-Wagon
*  or Range Rover, it is not a big deal to have a G-Wagon or Range Rover. Right. And people have
*  this need to show off. Yeah. But if everybody got the expensive shit, how else can you flex?
*  Right. License plate. Yeah, wild. Also, crime over there, almost non-existent. Yeah. Go to Dubai
*  and commit a crime. See how that goes. Yeah. Go to Abu Dhabi and commit a crime. They've
*  compartmentalized society. But yeah, they're strict, but it's also like, anybody there who's
*  working has been, there's a working class of people who do not really operate outside of
*  working within the society. Right. And then everybody else there who's not part of the
*  working class has money. So why would you commit crime? There's also the, did you ever see the
*  Vice documentary on some of the people that built Dubai? No. So some of the contractors,
*  what they would do is they would go to third world countries and they'd promise people exorbitant
*  amounts of money to go over there and work construction. Then they bring them over to Dubai
*  and then take their passports and then force them to live in squalor, give them a fraction of what
*  they paid and they're basically indentured service. Yeah. So the working system is,
*  I don't know how different it is from that even today, but basically like you work there for
*  11 months, you get one month off, you get paid very little money. It's not enough money for upward
*  mobility. While you're there, you are working just to work and then send money back home to your
*  family, wherever it is. You never will become part of society. So they've really curated a system
*  where those people have no upward mobility. Now, I imagine the advantage of that is there's no crime.
*  Yeah. Because everybody who's poor there is working. And they know their place,
*  they're in danger. It's not simple. It's not like you just get away with things. And we're taking
*  you from destitute poverty where your family would die. So they're like, yeah, we're giving
*  you an opportunity. These people are like, well, if I fuck up here, my whole family dies back home
*  or my whole family starves or my whole family is going to go through some horrible situation.
*  So I'm the lifeline for my family. So they are taking advantage of that desperation. Yeah. 100%.
*  But yeah, I guess what they would dictate, they would say the benefit of that is no crime. But
*  there is a social cost of that. There is a subclass of people that are there. There's always going to
*  be a social class, a social cost when you have monarchies. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then you have
*  people with exorbitant wealth and all the power. And then some of them turned bad, like Saddam
*  Hussein and his sons, which were famously some of the most evil motherfuckers that ever existed.
*  I mean, they would feed women to dogs. They would find women that were getting married,
*  steal the woman from the marriage, rape her, and then feed her to dogs. Jesus Christ. Yeah, man.
*  Uday and Kusay. There's been many tales written about how evil they were. They were like legitimate
*  serial killers. That's the risk of the monarchy, right? You don't know if that egg that comes out
*  is good. Well, it's also like having a child that grows up with total complete power. You're going
*  to have a Joffrey. You know, I mean, sometimes that's the archetype. But maybe you get a,
*  what is the guy that everybody thinks said everything great? Marcus Aurelius. Yeah, exactly.
*  Is it? I don't know. He just did a lot of psychedelics. Really? Yeah. Yeah. He was a
*  part of the Illucinian mysteries. Yeah. I didn't know that. Yeah. He was a part of that whole Greek
*  Illucinian mysteries thing. Yeah. Yeah. He was involved in those ceremonies. Yeah. There's,
*  a lot of speculation that ancient Greek society is specifically from Brian Murorescu's work.
*  Did you ever talk to him? No, but I read some stuff about there were some, there's certain plants
*  that grow that elicited the same chemical compounds as DMT or something. That's LSD. Or LSD. Yeah.
*  Well, there's a bunch of different ones that do like all kinds of different psychoactive ones,
*  but they've absolutely found definitive proof of the use of ergot. And ergot is a fungus that
*  gives people the same sort of psychedelic experience as LSD. Ergot? Ergot. Yeah. It's a
*  fungus. It's also a fungus that they connect with the Salem witch trials. Like a mushroom? Yeah.
*  It's like, yeah, it's like, it's, it's a fungus that grows on wheat. And that fungus is, it can be
*  toxic for some people who can kill them at certain doses, but it also imparts an LSD effect. And they
*  found ergot in some of the wine vessels. So they were taken without even knowing. No, they were
*  taken in on purpose. Oh. What is this? A heroic Greek potion. The ergot was in this drink. The
*  kykeon. Yeah, that's what they called it. This, this drink. And so they believed that this drink
*  contained a mixture of a bunch of different psychedelic compounds. One of it's for sure,
*  they know is ergot, but there's a few other ones that I can't remember that they know are in there
*  as well. And they found this from studying the, these ancient pottery vessels. I just, yeah,
*  your saucer looks like a mushroom. Is that on purpose? I don't think so, but it could. But if
*  your whole idea is, you know, that the saucers and mushrooms do have a lot of similarities,
*  but the stone dapes theory is if the mushrooms that took us to the next level, and now we have
*  the aliens taking us to the next level, it might be the aliens brought us the mushrooms. There we
*  go. Who knows? Anyway, but yeah, this is crazy. So then he was taking all that and that's why all
*  this wisdom. Well, that's why he was so beyond wise. And he also believed in forgiveness, even
*  forgiveness of his enemies. He's a Roman emperor. No, he was, he was very compassionate. He has all
*  these great quotes. I guess what I assume is like in the same way that somebody is writing Obama
*  speeches, people were writing his stuff. So I imagine that his stoicism or whatever are the
*  collection of the greatest ideas of the time. And the way to disseminate that information is to be
*  like, yo, it's from the emperor. It's from the top boss. Part of it, but meditations, I don't believe
*  was ever written with the intent of it being distributed. Oh, so they just found this diary.
*  Find that out. I think that's not trying to discredit him. I'm just saying. Well, for sure.
*  Definitely. He did. I mean, everybody at any point in time has the information of the greatest minds
*  they've encountered. Einstein was talking to other great people and then he might have the greatest
*  mind, but he's still able to. Yeah, it's a collaborative effort. Yeah. And including with
*  philosophy and certainly back then. But you know, this guy, this one guy, his experiences to this
*  day, they resonate. You read your meditations today. Like, oh, this is a guidebook to how to
*  live your life in a better way. Yeah. And it's rare that you would have someone in his circumstance
*  where he was raised to be king. Exactly. Then he would be successful. Yeah. And you know,
*  and then his son turns out to be a cunt. But then they say that was because of the lead pipes or
*  something like that. I'm sure that had something to do with it. There was something about like,
*  I was reading, or was it Nero? Who was the, uh, there was one emperor that just went crazy.
*  And they said is he wasn't raised in the castle. Who wasn't raised in the forum or whatever the
*  fuck it was. And then when he moved there and he started consuming the water from the lead pipes
*  that they started to warp his brain. And then he went more and more crazy throughout. I mean,
*  this is what some tour guide totally makes sense. But yeah, of course, they didn't know what lead
*  did. Do you know if they were stoked to have pipes, George Washington's teeth were made with lead.
*  Yeah. You know, that's that Shane Gillis is a great bit. It's a fucking bang. I love that bit.
*  But that's true. The literal mold that his teeth were fitted into his lead. He carried lead in his
*  mouth all day. Yeah. Just nuts. Wild boy. Wild boy. Yeah. But the country is founded by wild,
*  crazy fucking people. You kind of need a crazy motherfucker to found a country.
*  It's not like the most sane thing to be like, yo, let's just thwart the whole system,
*  do something completely different. We'll do it on our own. Not only that, but have this fail safe
*  method that exists today to keep someone from becoming a tyrant. Oh, to relinquish the power.
*  That was the greatest thing. Yeah. I think that might've been the greatest thing a leader has
*  ever done. Yeah. To set in motion this idea that you're not going to maintain this power after you
*  have it. Yeah, no one can. What a fucking. Pretty amazing. They had the foresight. Did he write about
*  it at all? Like, is there a moment where he regretted it two months later? He's like, man,
*  I should have kept that shit. Like he's going to deal with a parking ticket or something. He's like,
*  after he gets out of office, bullshit. I could put my horse here. Yeah.
*  I mean, imagine if someone tried to form a country today, how quick they'd put the
*  kibosh on that. I mean, it happens all the time. Yeah. But if somebody like
*  went to some new like Greenland or something, just said, we're going to set up shop here.
*  Yeah. The powers would be going no, no, no. Are you going to have weapons? Yeah. What? Fuck that.
*  You're going to make an army? Fuck out of here. Yeah. We're going to find a reason why you guys
*  are whatever you are. Pedophiles. I think you're racist. Yeah. Whatever the fuck you are. You hate women.
*  Yeah. We're going over there. Yeah. We got to stop this. We got to figure out a way to invade.
*  When are we going to take Greenland already or buy it? Wasn't Trump talking about buying it? He made
*  a tweet. I promise I won't do this. And he had like a giant Trump tower there that said Trump on the
*  ceiling. But it sounded like a cool acquisition. Yeah. Like don't they have all these minerals
*  and stuff and there's all this great. Also, if the world does warm up, that's a good spot to go to.
*  Ah. You know, throughout history, when the world's gotten colder and warmer, people have moved away
*  from the place you can't live in. Yeah. Yeah. To the places where you can live. So we got a nice
*  little fail safe. Yeah. Well, something. Imagine. Well, something. We're just all in Greenland.
*  There was discussions about Trump buying Greenland. Yeah. Because it's got a lot of,
*  I don't know. Why didn't that happen? I think Greenland shut it down. Isn't. Isn't Greenland
*  owned by Denmark or something? Everything for sale. Yeah. Come on. Are you sure? I just didn't get
*  the right offer. It might be the offer. Yeah. But we've made some good deals. Like that fucking
*  Louisiana purchase was a good deal. What a crazy deal. I mean. How about Alaska? That's a crazy.
*  Yeah. Alaska was nuts. Since 1867, the United States considered or made several proposals to
*  purchase the island of Greenland. From Denmark. Yeah. From Denmark. Who did it with the Danish West
*  Indies in 1917 while Greenland remains an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of
*  Denmark. A 1951 treaty gives the United States much control over an island once partially claimed
*  from exploration. It's got to be all kinds of shit up there that they could use. Yeah. What do you
*  think about Antarctica? Well, did you ever see that one guy that was on the Sean Ryan show that claims
*  that there's like a direct energy weapon out of Antarctica? Boy, that guy seems overconfident. Yeah.
*  That he knows what he's talking about. He's a fireman. He's not a scientist. He has access
*  to everything. Yeah. There's something about that that doesn't sit right with me, but I don't know.
*  Also, you know, it's just, it's so hard unless you have evidence, like unless you could show that
*  they could turn this thing on. Right. And what is it? Is it a neutrino detector that also can be used
*  as a directed energy weapon? That's a directed energy weapon. This is what they're saying. Yeah.
*  I mean, listen, that's a concept that existed for a long time. I'm sure they probably have something
*  like that. Yeah. They definitely have things that were just theoretical. They have a railgun now,
*  and this railgun can go through multiple layers of steel. Have you ever seen the railgun in operation?
*  No. It's crazy. Railgun, just like from Quake. This thing sends this bolt through, like, I think
*  they did like 10 giant steel plates in a row, and it just went through all of them like it was hot
*  butter. But is it a laser? What is the material that's actually going through it? I don't know
*  exactly how it works. So this is the thing. So this is, this is the rail, this bolt going through all
*  this steel. Jesus. Look at this. It just goes through everything. Goes through all that shit.
*  So what's going through it? Just going through everything, man. Look at that.
*  I mean, it's like total science fiction Star Wars type shit. Yeah. So they've got some wild shit,
*  and I guarantee they're working on direct energy weapons as well. Now, what they've been able to
*  accomplish versus what is theoretical, that's the real question. And if it did exist, if there was a
*  direct energy weapon, would they tell us? I don't think they would. No. Why would they tell us? No.
*  I mean, it gets, the conspiracies out there get wild. Like there's pyramids there. You've seen that
*  one, I'm sure. Yeah. But if you also start digging, they say nobody can dig under the ice. Don't
*  mess with the ice out there. I think there's a treaty across all countries that have somehow
*  taken apart or claimed a part of Antarctica. But I think the tricky thing is if you start digging
*  and you find animal remains, humans tend to follow animals wherever they go. So are we going to find
*  some humans over there? And then how does that distort the historical timeline? Or they find a
*  spaceship down there? Oh, Joe, now we're getting into this. Well, that was the thing. One of the
*  things that Lazar said is that one of the vehicles was a part of an archaeological dig.
*  But not- They found it in an archaeological dig. But not in Antarctica. No. It was in North America.
*  He didn't say where. He didn't say where. But he said one of the ships, they recovered from an
*  archaeological dig. And they think these things have been around for a long, long, long time.
*  The people that work with them, like Diana Pasulka, who wrote, what was it, Encounters,
*  she said that they refer to them as donations. These crashed UFOs, they don't even necessarily
*  think of them as crashed. They think they kind of let it crash. They're donations for us to back
*  engineer. That we're supposed to take them and go figure this out. And that this is something that
*  helps our technological evolution. And there's a lot of people that point to the creation of
*  fiber optics. That it all kind of happened right after Roswell. There's these descriptions
*  of fiber optics that existed in the crafts they found at Roswell. So they're looking at us like
*  we're looking at the orangutan. Yeah, here's a stick. Go fish with that stick. Yeah.
*  Well, I mean, that would be a good way to accelerate technologies to just introduce
*  something to them and go back engineer that. Yeah. Figure that out. I mean, isn't that how
*  we do it now? Yeah. Well, that's what Lazar had said they were doing with him in Area 51 and S4.
*  He was saying, but they didn't know exactly how these things worked. They didn't know how to
*  recreate it. And they wouldn't let the scientists talk to other scientists. He's like, science
*  doesn't exist in a vacuum like that. You need a collaborative effort of a bunch of different
*  people. And also different scientists that were working on the thing weren't allowed to talk to
*  each other. That's a military thing, right? For privacy. A compartmentalization thing. Yeah. For
*  top secret clearance. But he was the guy that was saying that they were also telling him that we are
*  a farm of souls. Yeah. And that's just the thing that the people that know about it say you can't
*  tell people because they would freak out. There'd be riots in the streets. I mean, that was just,
*  someone just recently said something like that. It was one of the recent conversations between
*  some top official. They were saying if people, if real disclosure happened and people knew exactly
*  what was going on, there'd be riots. He would be freaking out. I think we'd be okay now. Well,
*  who knows? I think we'd be all right. We found out that we really are just vessels for souls
*  and that we're being farmed by some super intelligent species that we will eventually become.
*  The farm thing is tricky, but that we're being groomed to become the super intelligent species
*  and it takes time and we have to get there slowly. That makes sense. I like the theory.
*  Yeah. That tracks that you would just kind of let us figure it out and let us go. No,
*  just in the right direction. There you go. And that the aliens would show up once we started
*  detonating nukes. Because it's like, whoa, that's a different direction. Yeah. Okay, guys, stop that.
*  Don't do that anymore. Yeah. Yeah. And we have the innocence. You can do all your nonsense and
*  do all your regular conventional warfare, but as soon as you start going atomic, we're going to
*  start talking. Yeah. We're going to let you know you're not the boss. Quite benevolent,
*  these aliens, huh? Well, also maybe recognize that this process has to take place and you can't hold
*  their hand. You know, teach a man to fish. He'll fish for the rest of his life. Give him out of
*  fish. He eats for a day. Yeah. Yeah. Teach him. You might meet him one day, Joe. Yeah. You might
*  meet him one day. I might already out of meet him. Will we believe you? Don't believe me. I'll lie.
*  So one thing I'll lie about, I don't lie about anything. I will lie to everybody about that.
*  Joe's already had. That means he's already done. I don't know shit. I think it's all fake. It's all
*  Russian propaganda. We need to support Ukraine. Me, well, there's fucking things in this room with
*  us right now. Observing from other dimensions. Yeah. Just making sure we're on the general path
*  towards technological progression, which is what eventually gives birth to it.
*  So they're. They're us. Yeah, but they're. They're what every intelligent species eventually
*  becomes. Eventually becomes. But they're basically on a further timeline. Yeah.
*  Yeah. So they're influencing their own timeline. They're influencing a similar species to evolve
*  to hit their level of technological sophistication. And they feel like that is their duty? I think
*  that's just what happens. That's probably what happens in the universe. I mean, look, when we go
*  to visit primitive societies, we bring the wells. Oh, that's true. We start creating electricity for
*  them. We teach them how to farm. Yeah. So we do. It just makes sense that they would do that,
*  especially if they're beyond advanced, like incomprehensibly more advanced than we are.
*  They would slowly help us do it right. Yeah. And stop us from making catastrophic errors.
*  And we're fun. We're like dogs in a way. Like dogs are fun. You want to teach them how to sit
*  and shit outside. Also, like, look at them go. Yeah. Look at these people. We create some good
*  stuff. Yeah. We're going to make it drones and shit. This is wild. Yeah. Look what they're doing.
*  Rail guns and shit. Look at these psychos. Hypersonic jets. Yeah. Look at them go.
*  And still cage fighting. Yeah. Yeah. We got it all. We got the whole. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Slap fighting. Slap fighting is like, that's the bottom. When that comes on to the alien's desk.
*  Wait, they're doing what? Slap. They can't defend each other. They have to stand there. Yeah. Do
*  they know about brain damage? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The people that host it also host MMA.
*  They know everything about it. They know everything about brain damage. And they're just
*  slaying. Look, sign up at the dotted line. You can ride a bull. You can fucking dirt bike ride.
*  You can get slapped. Yeah. You can do whatever you want in this country. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's probably what the aliens like. Jesus Christ. They probably look at slap fighting. Oh,
*  my God. Yeah. Someone trying to tell them not to do that. Yeah. Yeah. America is like the way that
*  we look at Trump. They look at America. You know what I mean? We're like, like, the guy's fucking
*  crazy, but he's funny as hell. Right. That's them. They're just looking at us like they invented what?
*  What a bunch of psychos. Yeah. Yeah. And maybe all advancing civilizations are psychos. Maybe they all
*  eventually have to become integrated with technology to escape the boundaries and the
*  walls that are set up by their biology. Yeah. Because your biology has allowed you through
*  in a natural environment to achieve a place where you could be detached from the natural
*  environment with cities and buildings and structures and electricity and power and
*  technology and weapons and weapons that allow soft fleshy water balloons filled with blood
*  to go out there and kill grizzly bears from a hundred yards. Boom. And you stand next to them.
*  Look at me. Look what I did. You know, it's wild, but it seems like that is the only way you get to
*  be sophisticated enough to create technology. Yeah. You have to have controlled your environment
*  enough where you've stopped all the enemies and stopped all the predators. Egypt. Yeah. Like in
*  order to build those pyramids, you need a long time of safety. Yeah. You can't build them at the
*  same time that you're at war. Right. You're being attacked. There's famine. There's no water. Right.
*  You need long, safe, thousands of years. Thousands of years. Safe. Yeah. And food and abundance.
*  And then you need a thing for people to do so they don't kill each other. Keep them busy. Yep. Keep
*  them busy. Build. Keep them from fighting over power. Yeah. What if it was that simple?
*  Who knows what it was with those folks? Because I think they were probably more sophisticated than
*  we are today. It's just the only thing that makes sense to me that they were able to get these
*  multiple tons, stones down from the mountains with no road system. That's the tricky thing.
*  What is it? The Aswan Valley that they got the stones from for the pyramids in Giza. That is a
*  really tricky thing to consider. It's all tricky. Some of them were from 500 miles away. Yeah. They
*  were 80 tons. They got them out of the mountains. They moved them down. They cut them perfectly.
*  What did they do? How did they do it? What are the machines? What was the technology? Was it no
*  technology? Really? Are you sure? Is it just based on what? Our understanding currently of what
*  happened 12,000 years ago, which is not that good? Yeah. No, we have a piecemeal understanding,
*  a very minute understanding of what was possible back then based on the evidence of the result of
*  what was possible, which is the pyramids, which is bananas. We're also trying to explain it with
*  theories that we've accepted to be fact that are really not that much. This idea that it was all
*  done with the chisels and stones, I don't necessarily subscribe to that. It says who.
*  All they would have to do is find one piece of machinery that didn't exist before they could
*  understand. And they found things before that they didn't know existed and they couldn't
*  understand. Like what is that mechanism? The anti-theoric? What is it called? There was a
*  computer that they found this computer in gears. It was in a Roman ship that it sank to the bottom
*  of the ocean. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Was the antikythera, antikythera medic mechanism. Yeah. So this thing,
*  um, it's an ancient Greek, go back to that, please. So I could read that. It's an ancient Greek
*  hand powered orary, a model of the solar system described as the oldest known example of an
*  analog computer. It's used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses decades in advance.
*  It also could be used to track the four year cycle of antithetic games, athletic games,
*  simpler to the Olympiad, the cycle of the ancient Olympic games. The artifact was among the records
*  retrieved from a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island of anti, how do you say that?
*  Antikythera? Antikythera? How do you say it? Antikythera. Antikythera. In 1901,
*  in 1902, as identified by archeologists, Valerio Steyas as containing a gear, the device housed in
*  the remains of a wooden frame case of uncertain overall size, 34 centimeters by 18 centimeters by
*  nine centimeters, was found as one lump later separated into three main fragments, which are
*  now divided into 82 separate fragments after conservation efforts. Four of these fragments
*  contain gears while inscriptions are found on many others. The largest gear is about 13 centimeters
*  in diameter and originally had 223 teeth. All these fragments of the mechanisms are kept in
*  National Archaeological Museum in Athens, along with the reconstructions and replicas to demonstrate
*  how it may have looked and worked. See if you can find what the replica of what it looked like.
*  But, you know, so they had to sort of like figure out how the fuck did they do this? Like,
*  how did they know this? What's involved in this? Like, was this ancient technology that existed
*  like a long time ago that they had preserved and held on to? Like, what was the, when was the
*  creation of that thing? So there's things that we know that we didn't think that they could do
*  that sort of really throw a monkey wrench into our understanding. Yeah. Yeah. That's just one.
*  That's just one that they found. I mean, there could have been stuff from thousands of years
*  before that that just doesn't exist anymore. You know, you deal with erosion, you deal with time,
*  and especially over thousands of years, 12,000 years. Boy, you have nothing left. There's no
*  evidence of whatever these machines were. It would be interesting to study like,
*  what happened to technology during the medieval ages? What is it called? What is it during the
*  Black Plague? Or what was it called? Medieval ages? What was that term? Yeah. But during the plague,
*  during the plague, right? Where was there an erosion of intellectual property? Right. Because
*  people were dying off. Exactly. People are dying off. And do the physicists die? Like, because we
*  always talk about this. What happened when all the physicists die? What happened when all the
*  scientists die? So was there an erosion? Was there a step back in our ability to create things
*  during that period? And if there was something that was even worse than that that happened
*  throughout history, i.e. like a asteroid or something in the earth, well, that erosion would
*  just be 10 times worse. 100 times worse. But I like to look into that. Yeah. Because you still see
*  great works of art that happened during the mid-eighth, mid- what is it? Is it mid-eighth?
*  Medieval. Medieval ages. Yeah. You see these great cathedrals go up. So there still were,
*  I would imagine, they were maintaining their ability to create these great structures.
*  Right. But there had to be a dip in productivity. So let's see what that dip is and then multiply it
*  by the catastrophe. Right. Well, I think people were just like knocked back into the stone age.
*  I think that's probably what happened. That makes sense. And that's why you see the emergence of
*  written language and all these different things from Mesopotamia. Like that's 6,000 years later
*  after the impacts probably. So it took that amount of time to recover. Yeah. And build back
*  the knowledge set. And keep in mind, the knowledge set isn't maintained with the efficiency that we
*  have it now, right? Like you get a couple books that get destroyed and there is physics gone.
*  That's the Library of Alexandria. They burn the Library of Alexandria and then everybody's like,
*  what happened? Yeah. That was the knowledge. Take a guess. Yeah. Yeah. How'd they build this shit?
*  We've burned it. Sorry. Yeah. It is vulnerable. We take it for granted. It is incredibly vulnerable.
*  Oh man. We're even more vulnerable now because everything's on hard drives.
*  You know, so all it takes is the power going off and we're fucked. Yeah. And how long would it take
*  for the power gets back on? Boy, asteroid impacts kills the whole grid. Everyone's knocked to the
*  stone age for a couple hundred years. Bro, you ain't getting into them hard drives. Yeah. You're
*  never going to figure it out. And although the hard drives are rot, the moisture in the air,
*  the erosion, they'll slowly evaporate. Yeah. And if somebody handed you a hard drive
*  2000 years later, you would just think it was a piece of plastic. Yeah. You have no clue that
*  all the information. How about that thing? That thing was just a lump of- We don't know what the
*  fuck that does. It was all corroded and fucked up. They don't know what it is. It's the only one
*  they've ever found, I think, I'm reading. Yeah. I mean, how many of them were there? It wasn't
*  the only one. Yeah. They probably had a bunch of them. They probably have even better ones.
*  That's the question they're saying. Like, what if it was the only one?
*  It's a fucking mystery, baby. We love it. But it's a fun time. It's the best. It's a fun time
*  to be alive. As chaotic as it is, this is a really fun time to be alive. Amen. All right. My brother,
*  I love you to death. You're the man. Thank you. Thanks for being here. I'm so happy to see you
*  killing it. It's beautiful to watch. You're out there crushing it. Come on, man. Appreciate you.
*  You're on top of it. I love it. Thank you, man. All right. Anything to tell anybody? Go check out.
*  If you want to come check out the tour, that'd be great. Life tour. We're coming to Austin,
*  actually. When are you coming? April 16th, I think, or something like that. Doing the moody.
*  Nice. Yeah. Beautiful. Beautiful. That'd be awesome. Come out tonight. All right. Thank you so
*  much. My brother. Thank you. Bye, everybody.
