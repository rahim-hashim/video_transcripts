# JRE MMA Show #90 with Rashad Evans
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 11, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auslk18GgIE)
*  3, 2, 1, boom.
*  You tell a lot about a man whether or not he's one of those dudes that has one of them
*  wallet phone cases.
*  Rashad Evans, you're a wallet phone case guy.
*  You pack it all into one package.
*  You know what?
*  I wasn't always a wallet phone case guy.
*  It's kind of something that just kind of evolved into.
*  I was one that was carrying around the man purse for a while and after a while, I kind
*  of transitioned to just the wallet case.
*  That's a lot of work.
*  Look how thick that sucker is.
*  It's like a Costanza.
*  Look at that thing.
*  That thing's giant.
*  Every single time I clean it out, I tell myself I'm not going to put any more cards in there
*  except for the ones I need, but it just attracts the cards.
*  That's a problem.
*  I have one of those Ridge wallets.
*  You know what those are?
*  Those are the shit because you can't really get much in there.
*  I get like a credit card or two and my license.
*  That's it.
*  See, that's what I need.
*  I need to have that discipline where there's nothing else to carry but what I have to carry.
*  It's got a little money clip on it, so I'll shove a couple bills in there and that's it.
*  I go out like that.
*  That's what I need.
*  That's what you need.
*  Front pocket.
*  All this nonsense.
*  That's so thick.
*  It's thick.
*  You might as well go back to the man purse.
*  But you know what?
*  You might as well get a backpack or a fanny pack.
*  I'll send you one of these.
*  I just sent two to Stipe Miocic.
*  Those look all right though.
*  That's pretty dope, right?
*  Yeah, that's pretty dope.
*  That's my own company.
*  Well, we don't make them.
*  We buy them from Roots and we put our stamp on it.
*  Yeah, leather, right?
*  You might want to go for it.
*  Yeah, I do.
*  You're a bold man.
*  You can wear a fanny pack.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I was rocking the man purse before anybody else was wearing it.
*  I mean, out in America, out in Europe, they were doing it a long time ago.
*  But in America, I was a trailblazer, I like to say, at least among my friends.
*  It is a weird thing, right?
*  Guys are not supposed to wear bags, but women have.
*  All these different brands of bags they carry around, Fendi and Gucci and this and that,
*  and it makes you look like you're special because you got some fancy bag.
*  And carrying a bag actually helped me be more prepared than ever because I would always
*  be carrying one of those dudes, can't carry enough stuff and I always become wishing I
*  had things that I didn't have and I'm like, you know what?
*  The bag worked.
*  But why is it that we're afraid to carry a bag?
*  A guy can carry a backpack.
*  Backpack's fine.
*  I guess you got shit to do.
*  You got a backpack.
*  You're fucking serious.
*  It's got two straps.
*  But one strap, like man, what's wrong with you?
*  I think it's because you have to do the feminine hold at times with the one strap.
*  But dudes do it over the shoulder so you don't have to do that.
*  Then you're like, it's a satchel.
*  Then it's manly.
*  Very strange, right?
*  How a bag became manly or not manly based on the amount of straps.
*  It's a thin line.
*  Yeah, and then for women, it's like a status symbol.
*  Like what kind of bag they're carrying around.
*  Nobody gives a fuck what kind of backpack you have.
*  Right?
*  If a dude has a nice backpack, no one's like, bro, where'd you get that backpack?
*  But I mean, you got a nice- Fanny pack?
*  Fanny pack.
*  Sort of, not really.
*  It doesn't get the respect it deserves.
*  It sticks out.
*  The people are like, okay, he's got enough balls to carry a fanny pack.
*  Yes, there's a little bit of that.
*  A little bit of that.
*  A little bit of, I don't give a fuck.
*  I've seen a fanny pack carried where it's across the shoulder.
*  Weak people.
*  Weak people.
*  Scared.
*  They're scared to rock a real fanny pack.
*  Like with the waist.
*  Yeah, they're cowards.
*  They're cowards.
*  They're fashion cowards.
*  They don't want anybody calling them out and wearing a fanny pack.
*  No, no, no, it's a shoulder bag.
*  It's not a shoulder bag, bitch.
*  You have to wear it right in front.
*  It's a fat man's fanny pack.
*  You're wearing it over your shoulders.
*  That's what it is.
*  They're wearing it in a way you're not supposed to wear it.
*  It's like if you wore a backpack around your waist, people would be like, what the fuck
*  are you doing?
*  It's not a backpack.
*  It's wrapped around your waist.
*  What are you doing?
*  I think that Karen, here you have everything you want, like right here.
*  What about right here, man?
*  You don't even have to lift your hands up.
*  Look at that.
*  They're right in there.
*  I guess I'm just trying to just wear it, like say how I think I would wear that one.
*  But you're kind of convincing me, Joe, that maybe the front carry might be the way to
*  go.
*  The only issue is girls won't fuck you.
*  Some girls, some girls, like you wear a fanny pack, that's it.
*  See, I'm married anyway, so I'm good now.
*  Beautiful.
*  Perfect.
*  Yeah, I'm good with that.
*  Every married man, like myself, every married man should have a fucking fanny pack.
*  It's a deterrent, pussy deterrent.
*  It's a little bit of that, but it's also, fuck you.
*  That's what it says.
*  Fuck you.
*  I carry my own shit.
*  Right there.
*  Keep my shit right there.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Yeah, keep it together.
*  Keep it together.
*  And then you also have this crazy green drink that you were telling me about.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  So this right here is spirulina.
*  Ever since I changed my diet up, I needed to have a couple of these every single day.
*  And it makes me feel good.
*  Yeah?
*  Yeah, I don't eat meat anymore, so I know you're a big meat eater.
*  Yeah, do you eat fish or any of that?
*  No.
*  Nothing?
*  All vegan?
*  All vegan.
*  When did you become vegan?
*  Probably about, man, I want to say probably about almost two years now.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, almost two years now.
*  Like it?
*  I love it.
*  It's changed my life, man.
*  It's been one of the things I can honestly say that's just revolutionized my complete
*  everything.
*  It's been everything that's lately that has changed me from a mental standpoint, physical
*  standpoint, and even a spiritual standpoint.
*  I definitely think it changes the mind because this all meat diet that I've been on, that
*  changes your mind the other way.
*  It makes you more aggressive.
*  Yeah, too much so.
*  Yeah, I have to work out extra to keep the demons at bay.
*  It's the blood.
*  It is.
*  It's that.
*  If you think about it, if your body thinks, okay, I have to eat animals all the time because
*  all this motherfucker eats is animals, right?
*  If your body thinks that, your body's going to sort of take on the characteristics of
*  something that's a predator, right?
*  You would become more, I mean, this is obviously like some bullshit bro psychology because
*  I'm a moron, but I would say your body is going to think I'm more aggressive.
*  I have to chase shit down and kill it.
*  You have to be more predatory.
*  Your body has to think that way.
*  I can get with that.
*  It makes sense though.
*  It makes sense.
*  Did you do it right after you retired?
*  Not right after I retired.
*  It was kind of something that kind of just happened.
*  Ever since I, because I do mushrooms, right?
*  Uh-oh.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It was when I did a, like when I had a really, really deep trip that just caused me to have
*  one of those ego deaths.
*  When I had the ego death, I was like in a state where this knowingness was coming to
*  me and it was like, I was like, it was all day.
*  I did a mushroom ceremony and it was all day and I was just out in the sun and just in
*  my own mind.
*  I was smelling real bad and then I smell myself.
*  You know how you catch a smell of yourself and I was like, oh my God, I stink.
*  Then the knowingness said, you stink because you eat dead rotting flesh.
*  It said if you want life, then you eat life.
*  That's what this knowingness said to me.
*  Then I was like, that's a strange thought that just come into my mind like that.
*  Then after that, no kidding, I just lost my taste for meat.
*  I used to eat all kinds of meat.
*  I would eat pork and I was big into pork and big into all kinds of meat and I was never
*  one of those diet guys at all.
*  But after that happened to me, after I had that experience, it was just one of those
*  things that I just couldn't help but go into.
*  I just lost the taste for me.
*  One trip.
*  Yeah.
*  It kind of started when I, like about eight months before that, I did The Toad.
*  Then The Toad was one that really was the catalyst for everything.
*  There's a lot of people listening going, what the fuck is he saying?
*  You did The Toad?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So five, M-E-O-D-M-T, which is The Toad.
*  The Toad was one that was, I guess, the catalyst of busting that gate open.
*  That's a crazy psychedelic.
*  That's a very underrated psychedelic.
*  Oh my God.
*  That will ...
*  Yeah.
*  That's the first really ... I had done mushrooms before, but I did a fairly small dose.
*  I mean fairly small in that I could walk around.
*  I was pretty whacked out, but I could walk around a couple grams.
*  But the five M-E-O-D-M-T was the first one where I just ceased to exist.
*  I just stopped and it made me really aware of ego, really aware of even the way I express
*  myself, the way I would frame sentences and say things.
*  I was trying to sound cool or I was trying to portray something in a way, not just trying
*  to portray the information, but trying to impress people.
*  It made me feel real gross.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's the thing.
*  When I had my five M-E-O experience, it was ... Man, I just never ... I never thought
*  that consciousness could be so vast and so big.
*  When you have that experience with the five M-E-O, it made this consciousness look as
*  if it was a drop in a bucket, just a little drop.
*  I got to experience the ocean of consciousness.
*  That right there was the most humbling experience I ever had, just to feel my ego, who I thought
*  I was, what I thought I was, completely just annihilated and to feel what I actually was.
*  It was crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel like regular consciousness that most of us exist in most of the time is a veneer.
*  It's a very thin veneer.
*  Through some things, you get a taste of what's under the surface through meditation and yoga
*  and all these different methods that people use, holotropic breathing.
*  You get a taste of what's underneath the surface, Kundalini Yoga apparently.
*  Kundalini Yoga apparently, I've never really done it, but some people say you could really
*  trip out if you do it in a certain way for long periods of time.
*  People have very intense psychedelic experiences akin to DMT.
*  Yeah.
*  I had a Kundalini experience, like an awakening where it was like a ... I just had ... felt
*  like the top of my head just completely was gone.
*  It was like I was just open to all the information.
*  It was a crazy ... It was like I had no head.
*  I was just ... Information was just pouring into ...
*  Like no roof.
*  No roof.
*  Was this from Kundalini?
*  No, it was from mushrooms, but I felt that Kundalini experience where you see the light.
*  It was like this really intense light that happens in my head and it was just boom, you
*  see the universe.
*  You know that thing about the center of your head, that's what the ... There's a lot of
*  speculation on what the Egyptians were trying to draw when they were drawing certain images,
*  but there's certain temples that seem to mimic certain shapes in these temples that seem
*  to mimic the pineal gland.
*  Even the eye, there's that famous Egyptian eye that has that sort of dip down and that
*  weird Egyptian shape.
*  There's been a bunch of different scholars that have tried to figure out what exactly
*  that meant and one of the theories is that that's a cross section of the pineal gland
*  and they think that what they were emphasizing was that that is the area where the brain
*  produces all the psychedelic chemicals.
*  They speculated this for a long time, but Dr. Rick Strassman, he's the guy that wrote
*  that book DMT The Spirit Molecule and there was actually a documentary on it that I hosted
*  and he's done a bunch of work with this Cottonwood Research Foundation where they've shown now
*  that it exists in live rats and that it is actually produced by that gland, that DMT
*  is actually produced in these animals by this one particular gland that they associated
*  with spiritual awakening with the third eye.
*  So it actually is a real thing, that feeling that you get.
*  The thing about mushrooms that's really interesting is mushrooms actually mimic natural human
*  neurochemistry.
*  There's 5-MeO DMT, there's NNDMT and then what mushrooms, what it's processed to, the
*  way your body processes it becomes something called 4-Fox4-Aloxyn-N-N-dimethyltryptamine.
*  So it's real, it's all real close.
*  I might have butchered that technical description, but it's real close to human neurochemistry
*  so your body absorbs it very easily.
*  Your body takes it in, your body knows what it is.
*  Your body knows what to do with it.
*  See, when I was, I like mushrooms because of mushrooms.
*  So the 5-MeO is so powerful that you can't really get a handle on what happened.
*  I came back from being away for like 17 minutes and I'm just like, whoa, that was intense.
*  I felt as if I was everything all at the same time and it was so many different things that
*  was just happening, but you really can't unpack it because it's incomprehensible to an extent,
*  for the larger extent because you're dealing with concepts that the human mind can't even
*  grasp because there's no vocabulary to speak about it.
*  So when I did the mushrooms, the mushrooms were kind of like the rivers and the lakes
*  that leads to the ocean and it helps me understand how I am part of something so big and something
*  so grand.
*  So when I have my mushroom experiences, they were all different in some respect.
*  Like whenever I do go deep, because I like to go deep, I don't play around with like
*  the two.
*  Microdosing.
*  Yeah, I mean I do microdosing sometimes, but I like to get in there with like 5 grams,
*  you know, 10.
*  That's how you know what's up.
*  Yeah, those big ones, the big doses where you get kind of scared.
*  You know, you got like 40 minutes before it kicks in, you're like, oh boy, there's no
*  turning back now.
*  There's no turning back now.
*  And that's the thing about it when you face that fear of just going deep and it's helped
*  me out so much because, you know, towards the end of my career, like I just didn't,
*  I didn't finish the way I wanted to, you know, and I felt like, you know, after I came back
*  from my injuries, I just wasn't the same fighter anymore.
*  Were you not the same physically or was it mentally?
*  It was physical, but it also, it became mental because it was, because physically I just
*  didn't feel the same.
*  You know, I didn't feel like I ever regained the power back in my legs.
*  And for the most part, my legs were everything, you know.
*  What were the injuries?
*  I had two ACL surgeries on my right knee and that completely just, it changed everything
*  for me because, you know, being a smaller light heavyweight, all of my power was all
*  in my legs, you know, and whatever I couldn't make up for in the size department up top,
*  I was usually able to make up for with the power of my legs, you know.
*  Is that related to the injury that you got when you were at Jackson's and Diego Sanchez
*  crashed into you?
*  No, that was, so that was a different injury.
*  So that was an MCL, but it was on my left knee.
*  So the right knee was the one who got, that always drove me crazy because I'm like, why
*  the fuck is a guy training for a world title fight in a regular class where everybody knows
*  people collide into people with regular classes all the time with millions of dollars on the
*  line.
*  I see that all the time though in top gyms.
*  And, but that, see that, see that's, that's, that's where the training has gone.
*  Like, like before we would train like maniacs, we would train crazy as hell and put ourselves
*  in some crazy situations.
*  And you, and you try to put yourself in a situation because you like, you know, I did
*  it before and I've done it so many times and nothing has happened.
*  But when you start to move up and there's more on the line, then you always have to
*  take every single precaution because you can't afford to take a step back.
*  And for me, once I have my knee injuries though, I just mentally was not the same person.
*  And when I competed, I wasn't the same person.
*  And then it affected me because then I'm like, you know, I'm not the same person.
*  Did you lose the ability to explode with your knees?
*  Did you have meniscus damage as well?
*  I have meniscus damage.
*  I lost the ability to explode and I lost, it would get tired.
*  My leg would get tired, you know, and it didn't have the same bounce, the same rhythm.
*  It kind of felt heavy and I couldn't really feel it in the front.
*  You know, the front part of my knee, I couldn't really feel it.
*  I had a little...
*  Did you have a patellar tendon graft?
*  I had a patellar tendon graft.
*  So they cut the front open and then they take the piece of the bone, they take a slice of
*  the patellar tendon and a piece of the bone on the bottom and they replace your ACL with
*  that?
*  Correct.
*  Yeah, I did that too.
*  It takes a long time to get that feeling back.
*  It took me more than a year before it felt right.
*  And then even then, if I was on my knees, it would hurt like hell.
*  See, and that's the thing.
*  Like I still, to this day, I still have dead spots where I can't feel in my knee.
*  Where it's numb.
*  Yeah, it's numb.
*  And I think I had to do it a lot because I had two of the knee surgeries back to back.
*  Like when I was only healing up for my first one, then it ruptured again.
*  So then I had to go back in and get it done.
*  You know, the first time it was with the cadaver and then the cadaver tissue didn't take, but
*  I didn't know that until like almost a year later and then it slipped out just training
*  normally.
*  Fuck.
*  Yeah, so.
*  ACLs are brutal.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  It was, it's the worst, man.
*  It's the worst.
*  And I admire guys who can come back and look phenomenal and do it, you know, still because
*  when you mess up your knee, you know, for me, it just kind of mentally just, it messed
*  me up a bit.
*  How much physical rehab did you have to do for that?
*  Man, I did a lot.
*  I did years worth of it.
*  Just, you know, the first time I didn't do it as well as I could have because I'm like,
*  I bounced back pretty easy and I did.
*  Like, I felt like I was bouncing back pretty easy.
*  But when it went the second time, then it was harder because not only was I healing
*  from the ACL, but then my knee was healing in general, just from, you know, the previous
*  surgery and then plus this surgery.
*  And then I had something different because in the first surgery, it wasn't, it wasn't
*  too invasive because I wasn't using my own, my own tissue.
*  That cadaver one is nice.
*  It's easy.
*  It's easy if it works.
*  If your body takes it.
*  How long did it take before it broke, blew out again?
*  Man, I was almost a year, I was training for another fight thinking I could get back in
*  shape and fight again.
*  And then when I was training for that fight, it blew out again.
*  Yeah, I was scheduled to fight Gustinson and then AJ ended up taking that fight instead.
*  But it was, it was, it was one that, that just, you know, it was like, first of all,
*  when I was out for two years healing from injury, you know, I got to see what it was
*  like to when all the cameras stopped flashing, when people stopped caring to get your pictures,
*  when, you know, that whole feeling, that whole feeling that just, that happens when you meet
*  that, when you, when you hit that transitional point and stop becoming that guy.
*  And it was difficult transition at first because, you know, even though I always told myself
*  I would never, you know, put myself in a mindset of being just that fighter, sooner or later
*  you become just that fighter.
*  And that's what happened to me.
*  So when I had to, uh, meaning that you weren't the best.
*  Well, not, not just the best, you weren't an elite world class.
*  I wasn't an elite world class fighter like I used to be.
*  I wasn't on that level anymore.
*  You know, and that, that, that was something for me that was just like, God damn, you know,
*  your use of your legs was so pivotal.
*  It was so, so huge for you.
*  Like when that, in that rampage fight, I remember that opening sequence when you just darted
*  after him and blast him with the right hand.
*  It was so fast.
*  Like he didn't even know what the fuck was happening.
*  As soon as the bell rang, you were on him and you cracked him quick.
*  And I was like, that is some serious explosion.
*  And that, and that was even in that fight, I could even wrestle like the last four weeks
*  to that fight because I had, uh, I pulled my hamstring in a fight.
*  So I was just really just drilling up until that fight for the last four weeks.
*  So when I came out like that, I was like, I was a little insecure and I was like, you
*  know what, I'm just going to see what happened if I go and it worked.
*  I was like, okay, I still got some spring.
*  It worked perfect.
*  Yeah.
*  So, um, yeah.
*  So, so when that, when I was into my career and just kind of getting, you know, kind of
*  trying to figure out like what, what's next for me, you know, um, it was hard, you know,
*  it was just a hard place because, um, you know, I didn't really have anybody to talk
*  to.
*  I didn't really know what I was going to do next in my life, you know?
*  And then when I started fighting again, I still was in that place where I just wasn't
*  totally back to fighting my mentality because fighting is something mentally that it takes,
*  it takes a certain mentality for, you know?
*  And for me, fighting was something that I did to exercise some demons a bit, you know?
*  But having some time away from the sport, it allowed me to figure out other ways to
*  exercise those demons and, you know, figure out some things around them, you know, the
*  things that were my fuel before, I kind of made peace with them.
*  And then making peace with a lot of the things that I was using for my fuel, it just changed
*  the way I fought and the way I seen fighting.
*  So coming back to fight, I just wasn't that same fighter anymore.
*  And then when I got to the point where I was like, man, I can't keep myself, like I was
*  like, man, I'm not fighting the way I want to fight.
*  And you know, there's, I mean, what's the point if I can't go and compete the way I
*  want to, I'm only torching myself.
*  So then I decided to retire.
*  But then when I retired, I was still was in a space where I was like, man, there's still
*  something missing.
*  So then when I did the five MEO DMT, that kind of put things in perspective in a whole
*  different way, you know?
*  And it just, it changed me.
*  It changed me a lot.
*  It changed the way that, you know, like I said, the way I think, the way I eat everything,
*  everything about it, you know?
*  So it was, it was so cathartic in so many, so many senses of the word, you know?
*  Do you think that something like that would be really beneficial for fighters that are
*  in the twilight of their career?
*  I think, I think it could be.
*  I think, I think every fighter gets to a point where you fight enough, then fighting, it
*  kind of, it kind of, you kind of get in a weird space about it.
*  And you know, I've seen fighters go through that period where they just kind of like figuring
*  out that why am I still doing this?
*  You know, they've had great moments inside the cage, but then they have those down moments.
*  And those down moments are the moments where it's harder to come back from.
*  And I think those are the times where you, you know, a psychedelic or something like
*  that could put things in perspective and allow the fighter to see the why behind the reason
*  they're doing it and maybe create a new why.
*  Yeah, you're so different.
*  It's funny.
*  I've noticed that about you over the last few years of just, I don't get to see you
*  that often.
*  And when I get to see you over the last few years, I'm like, wow, something has changed
*  in Rashad.
*  Like you're, you're more, I mean, I hate to use the word spiritual, but you seem like
*  a more spiritual, more peaceful guy.
*  I had noticed that.
*  So that's why I was really interested to have this conversation, see what your journey was.
*  Yeah, it's been, it's been one hell of a journey, man.
*  You know, I just, I teamed up with some people in Denver.
*  One of my good friends, Del Jolly out in Denver, you know, he's the one who told me about the
*  medicine, about the medicine, the Toad medicine.
*  And after that, we just kind of continued to always link up and we'd do, you know, a
*  bunch of ceremonies together.
*  We do ayahuasca and just, just make sure we always have that connection.
*  But it was through working with him, you know, I became, you know, part of this group, Unlimited
*  Sciences and Unlimited Sciences.
*  What we were doing is, you know, we've been able to, we want to make psilocybin usage
*  because Del Jolly was one of the guys who, who got, who's on the committee who got it
*  approved for Denver, decriminalizing.
*  He was one of the guys who made that possible.
*  Do you know how it works?
*  So are you allowed to possess a certain amount of psilocybin in Denver?
*  Is that how it works?
*  I'm not really too sure exactly how it all works with that, but I think that they're
*  still working out the details of how it's going to be, which you can possess on the
*  legal side.
*  But with Unlimited Sciences, you know, we've, you know, we've been able to take that.
*  We want to take the psilocybin experience where it's one that people can go through
*  for healing and help and get consistent, consistent information, consistent data on, you know,
*  the full spectrum on how you can use it in the ways it's used.
*  So we've teamed up and this has never been done before.
*  We teamed up with John Hopkins University and we're going to be part of their study
*  and we're going to do like the first real world study where we go out and, and, you
*  know, take information from people, you know, people from 18 and up who can speak English,
*  and sign up for our study.
*  And you know, what you do is you go and you fill out a questionnaire and everything is
*  is HIPAA protected.
*  So no one has to worry about, you know, getting in trouble for what their usage of psilocybin.
*  But you know, John Hopkins has taken all this information and we're collecting it for them.
*  And you know, what we want to do is we want to be able to give this back to them so that
*  they can see on which way they want to direct their clinical research, you know, and what
*  that can do is, you know, with with unlimited sciences, it's it comes from this group called
*  what realm of caring and realm of caring is out in Denver and realm of caring was for
*  medical refugees during the whole when there was a medical refugees for cannabis who couldn't
*  use in their state came to Denver where they were able to use it.
*  But when they first came that there wasn't there wasn't, you know, any information on
*  how much you to use because Heather Jackson and this other girl who started in Amherst
*  Page, they started the realm of caring and there was just them they were treating their
*  child and their children had seizures and epilepsy and stuff like that.
*  So they wanted they tried everything in a medical field to help them but they couldn't
*  could not help them with that.
*  So then he went to cannabis and there was only two of them doing it.
*  So they really have much information to go back from.
*  So then they would share information amongst each other and then they would ask other
*  people and then through networking, they create this huge community of people with data and
*  then they started to come with more and more data and then they started working with John
*  Hopkins University and made a protocol and everything else.
*  Now the realm of caring helped thousands of families all over the world just with the
*  information and data they didn't have been able to collect.
*  That's awesome.
*  John Hopkins has been involved in psilocybin research for a while, right?
*  They had some thing that they did on near-death patients, people that are close to death and
*  alleviating the fear of passing.
*  Yeah and that's one thing that they've they're very interested in diving into that the mind
*  aspect and everything and I think that the real world study would be good because what
*  it does is it allows you know it allows them to put their money and their resources into
*  where people are actually using it and the things that are interesting to the people.
*  So I mean it's one thing to have it in a clinic clinical setting but it's another thing to
*  do it on your own and be able to get the results from it.
*  So hopefully to study with John Hopkins University it definitely changes games and puts things
*  on a level where people can get the healing they need from the mushrooms.
*  Have you read any McKenna stuff?
*  A little bit.
*  I follow McKenna a bit.
*  I listen to him quite a bit.
*  Yeah fascinating guy.
*  A weird voice, right?
*  Weird voice but hypnotic almost.
*  Yeah you can't I mean I listen to hours of McKenna and just his understanding and breakdown
*  of mushrooms.
*  This is crazy.
*  Well I'm friends with his brother and his brother is another genius really fascinating
*  character who's also an outspoken psychedelic proponent and he lives up in British Columbia
*  now and he's a big proponent of one of, Terrence had a theory that Dennis subscribes to called
*  the stoned ape theory.
*  Do you know this theory?
*  Yeah and this is a really controversial theory but fascinating that they believe that at
*  least Terrence had this idea that one of the catalysts for human evolution that changed
*  us from lower primates to human beings was the consumption of psilocybin and that animals,
*  these pre-human primates would flip over cow patties and experiment by eating grubs and
*  bugs and things they find there and they would also eat the mushrooms that would grow on
*  the cow patties and the doubling of the human brain size over a period of two million years
*  is this gigantic mystery.
*  Like they have no idea what happened.
*  I mean it's a, apparently according to biologists, it's the biggest mystery in the fossil record
*  that the human brain doubled and not just that any organ would double in size over a
*  period of two million years but that the organ responsible for the theory of evolution in
*  the first place doubled over two million years is really interesting but it coincides with
*  climate change and coincides with these rain forests and this is all Terrence's work I'm
*  repeating, it coincides with these rain forests receding into grasslands and then these undulates,
*  these cow-like animals that would live on these grasslands and eat the cow and take
*  shits and then the manure would grow or the psilocybin rather would grow in the manure
*  and they would follow these cows around and then eat their mushrooms that would grow in
*  their manure and it also coincides with the earliest civilizations would all worship cattle
*  like Choctaw-hiyuk which is one of the earliest known civilizations. They had these, it was a real
*  cattle worshiping sort of, I don't want to say cult but the way their culture would operate,
*  they worship cattle and some would say well that's because they ate them and they used their milk
*  but I'm sure, I'm sure that had something to do with it but like the Hindus don't even eat them,
*  they just worship them. Imagine that, you got a billion people living in a place, everyone's
*  starving and they're not eating the cows, they're not eating the most delicious animal on the planet.
*  Well it's because they grew mushrooms and the ancient Hindu scripts like Soma is one of the
*  main sacraments that they would talk about. No one really understood, to this day they're not
*  exactly sure what Soma is but it's some sort of a psychedelic sacrament and it probably was a
*  combination of many things but a big one was most likely psilocybin, was a part of that and that
*  corresponded with their relationship with cows. They had this worship of cattle where they wouldn't
*  eat them and the reason is because God came out of their butt in their eyes, they would make the
*  manure, the mushrooms would grow in the manure and there's all sorts of mushroom iconography and all
*  of their ancient religious artwork. I mean I think mushrooms, I know mushrooms have played a big part
*  in our society and our civilization and our ancient civilization and I don't think it's been
*  properly covered the way that it could be but it's amazing because the minute you eat a mushroom
*  at the right dosage, you feel it, you feel the fact that it's like oh this is something ancient
*  because there's something that happens when you go to that place where you lose the
*  you lose the self. When you lose the self then there's something that happens that's
*  that's just magical, there really is no way to explain it or dress it up with words. It's just
*  it's just a mad something magical that happens once you reach that level. Yeah whenever I have
*  these conversations with people there's two types of people. There's people like you that have the
*  experiences that go mm-hmm and then there's people that have no experience at all that look
*  you like yeah it's mushrooms but I feel bad for those people because I know how I used to think
*  and I would have dismissed it the same way. I would have said this is the foolish notions of
*  frivolous spiritual people that are just being ridiculous and they think oh it's all about the
*  mushrooms man and but it is it is if you do it you'll realize like oh well if you do any real
*  potent breakthrough psychedelic any real breakthrough psychedelic experience is going
*  to make you humble. It's going to make you realize like oh there's more to this than everyday
*  consciousness. There's more to this experience, this existence. There's something way bigger
*  and you only can tap into it through a variety of different methods whether it's you know would
*  you know name your psychedelic or name your trance-like state that people can go into.
*  There's a lot of different ways to tap into it but once you do you realize like this is not
*  this little thin thing that we're touching right now this is not everything. Right and that's the
*  thing about it. It really just cuts through the whole materialism of everything. Yeah. It really
*  shows that materialism is just a product of consciousness you know and sometimes we tend
*  to think that you know our consciousness is a product of the materialism but you know at the
*  end of the day consciousness is everything and when I did my toad experience I almost felt as if
*  like I'm not really here and I'm really somewhere else just projecting my consciousness to here and
*  it seemed as if like when I smoked the toad the venom severed that connection and the connection
*  wasn't able to come here on earth and I was just really where I really am. That's what it felt like
*  and then when I came back to my body I remember feeling like I didn't want to come back and
*  actually it was saying like please don't go please don't go when I came back. Wow. I felt like I was
*  I dissolved and I became a part of everything. I felt like I always tend to think of
*  life as like my own view of experience. It's right here right. My life is right here. Now
*  right now it's in this room later on it'll be at the comedy store. There's places I go. My life is
*  where those places are but when I had my first MAOD, 5 MAOD experience it felt like no no no
*  it's all together. You're in the middle of this infinite soup of life and there's no one spot.
*  Right. That spot is your imagination. It's like your own the limitations of your biology that
*  we have kept from the time that we were small little mammals to the time that we were lower
*  primates to the time that we're human beings. The limit the biological instincts to survive
*  and to preserve our DNA and to carry that DNA on all those instincts are the reason why we're here
*  but also so limiting because they keep your consciousness bottled up in the location that
*  you're at. It keeps your feeling of life contained to wherever you're at at that moment and staying
*  safe and then keeping people paying attention to you and making sure you got the coolest shit and
*  all the things that seem so silly when you trip. Yeah absolutely absolutely when I fall away
*  and the feeling of falling away and not being who I think I am is almost the most freeing feeling
*  but at the same time it is one of the scariest. Yeah. It's one of the scariest at the same time
*  but it's necessary and is necessary in order to to reach a certain point of understanding.
*  When you reach a certain point of understanding of going inside then you don't need a guru.
*  You don't need anyone to drop insight or knowledge because all the knowledge and insight
*  it's there if you go deep enough and you know how to go deep enough and you understand the fact that
*  there's this knowingness and it's hard to explain like it sounds crazy to say
*  but there's just this knowingness out there and you can tap into it. Yeah there's something out
*  there for sure. What's interesting to me is some people have a way better grasp of the English
*  language and they're way better at describing things. They're way better at sort of putting
*  trips into perspective because everyone sucks at it. Even the best people suck at it. I'm terrible
*  at it. I've described it the same way you described it. There's not really words for it. You know you
*  do your best but it's so poor like you're just the ability that words have to convey the experience.
*  There's no words that are correct. They don't even get in the neighborhood. They wrap around it.
*  And even in a state I remember being in a state where I was in one of my deepest trips
*  and I'm in the trip and my friend looks over at me and then I rave him over because I want to tell
*  him the secret that I found about consciousness and about existence but I couldn't tell him
*  because the the knowingness is telling me if I tell him then I'm not going to be able to come
*  back and live. I had to leave this earth. That's what it was telling me. So I remember just sitting
*  there just like man I want to be able to tell him and be able to convey to him in words what I'm
*  feeling. The only thing that came out of my mouth was just go sit over there it'll come to you
*  because that's what happened to me. I was in his yard and I just went
*  and walked and as I was walking this knowingness told me like I was walking barefoot in his grass
*  and I kept getting my feet poked and the knowingness told me it was like you know it told me the path
*  to walk and it said I'm the reason why I'm stepping on these these getting pricked is because I'm
*  stepping on live grass stepping on the dead spots where there's no and it just came to me just that
*  clear and I just started doing it and I wasn't getting pricked by the grass anymore then it
*  told me to sit down and then I sat down and then I just had like the most profound just
*  realizations just hit me like it was like it was like it was coming out of the sun.
*  It sounds crazy to say it was I was outside and I went and I was looking at the sun and it was like
*  the sun transitioned to something else it was just became very deep and it had layers of it was it
*  was very very trippy but during that experience I remember looking around and seeing everyone that
*  I was with and laughing to myself saying like they would not believe this but I'm actually
*  every single one of them and that that was like a thought that I remember thinking and feeling like
*  it like I'm feeling myself right now and it bugged me out. I know it's deep it's so deep.
*  Do you still train? All the time yeah I train all the time. You train all the time? Yeah. Do you
*  what do you feel different like even when you're hitting things? Yeah I've but not but not in a way
*  like I feel like oh man I feel bad I don't feel like that I just feel like um I mean ever since
*  I was able to to kind of come back after I this whole transition happened I feel like I have a
*  better idea on competing now like as far as like my mindset for competing is better than it was
*  before just because I don't um my ego's not so attached to it as it was you know and I'm able
*  to go out and just give my best in whatever it is it is and completely just be like oh it you know
*  it's whatever and it's easy to say now that I'm not competing where it counts for anything but
*  for me before even in practice it felt like something if I lost in practice then it would
*  stick with me for a couple days you know I'll be upset about that but now I can just go in and just
*  train and you know and it doesn't it doesn't stay with me like it would before. Do you feel like
*  though that to be an elite fighter maybe you need that burning desire to the point where mistakes
*  burn and they hurt and I know as a comedian I mean there's a there's a there's a parallel there
*  like where when if I'm really working hard or really concentrating hard anything I say that
*  is stupid or comes off wrong or I try something it doesn't work it will fuck with me for days
*  just all day long even in conversation I'm having fun with some friends and I say something stupid
*  like that and like it'll sit in my head for a day I'll wake up in the middle of the night to piss
*  going why the fuck did you say that it's the worst no you you do you do need that as an athlete but
*  at the same time particularly as a fighter right yeah because you you have to I mean it's so the
*  the difference between a champion you know is about it more than anybody between a champion
*  and a good fighter so close it's such a it's so close it's so close it is and sometimes it's that
*  fucking fire that anger that fear that drive inside of you to be elite to be the best and
*  sometimes that comes with every practice you have to win everything you have to do every fucking
*  training session you have to burn it out if you don't you feel like you're less than you could be
*  yeah I agree with that but there's also the other side of that too where there's that that that
*  blissful ignorance and that blissful ignorance is where you just go out and do something and you do
*  it 100 great all the time just because you enjoy it and there's not the pressure of oh I have to
*  do it a certain kind of way like for instance when when when John Jones was first competing
*  John Jones he competed so freely because you know it was just like he was it was just in his nature
*  like he was just so creative and he fought different because of you know he fought from
*  that place of just creativity that ignorance that that that ignorant bliss you know he couldn't be
*  beat he didn't believe he can be beat and you know he would fight that way and he would do some genius
*  stuff in there just because of that you know but then when you have those experiences where you
*  you know you've been caught in a fight or you've you know you made some mistakes in there then you
*  do know better but then those those those thoughts it actually slows you down a bit too because
*  you're not fully reacting you're you're thinking of a hair well before it was just kind of like a
*  reaction yeah I talk about his opening fight the opening sequence of his fight with Shogun I mean
*  he's 23 years old he's fighting for the world title and he opens up with a flying knee who the
*  fuck does that that's that that was that that was that that was that dumb and young
*  you know that's the best way to say it but at the same time that that blissful ignorance that's what
*  made that was his blueprint for so long you know and he's turned it into a whole fighting style
*  just that you know letting it all hang out letting it fly and that's what worried me um that's why
*  I thought in this fight with Dominic Reyes it was going to be a closer fight because of the fact that
*  Dominic Reyes now had that what John used to have being that blissful ignorance he didn't really
*  know how much you know how better John was or didn't even care he was just kind of like
*  I can't wait you know I'm saying he was so confident in himself almost in a in an
*  ignorant blissful way but it worked out for him you know well what's interesting about that fight is
*  first of all it's a great argument for five round championship fights because for the first three
*  rounds Dominic Reyes was winning yeah the question is whether he won the third round that's the one I
*  believe that's up for grabs most people that I've talked to think John won the last two clearly
*  most people most people that I talked to that are experts most people few disagree believe that
*  Dominic Reyes won the first three and the third round is the one that seems to be you go well
*  Dominic scored more but it was close enough where you could see someone giving it to John
*  particularly since John was pressing the action John was pushing forward maybe you give it to John
*  but they thought Dominic won it but they said if there's a disputable round it is that third round
*  yeah I agree one fucking judge gave John four rounds to one that's insane this is the same judge
*  that when I believe Luke Thomas is talking about this I'm sorry if I'm wrong because I'm not saying
*  the judge's name because I'm not sure if I'm correct but I believe it's the same judge that
*  Trevin Giles who fought James Krause Giles and Krause was an amazing fight Giles wound up winning
*  the decision but the first round Krause had his back for four minutes and the referee the judge
*  gave that round to Giles which is insane I mean for four minutes Krause had his back was the guy
*  was fighting off chokes Krause was real close to submitting him a couple times during those four
*  minutes and the judge the same judge who gave four rounds to John Jones gave that first round to
*  Giles where there was a dude on his back for four fucking minutes most of the round and maybe even
*  a fucking more egregious fight was Andre Yule versus Jonathan Martinez that fight was
*  fucking crazy that fight was crazy that was the most crazy one Martinez won that fight Martinez
*  won that fight Yule broke his arm I think so I'm not sure if it's a broken arm but he had a
*  significant injury to his right hand early in the fight somewhere in between either the first or
*  the second round not sure but he really couldn't throw a right hand and it was kind of hanging you
*  could kind of see it was hanging and Martinez put in work it was an amazing performance by him and
*  he got fucked over man real bad it was bad decision making there was a bunch of bad fights
*  there was a bunch of bad decisions it wasn't just one it was like four or five on a card of what
*  12 fights 11 12 fights I forget how many was from the opening prelims there was bad decisions just
*  almost like people who don't know what they're seeing yeah and that's crazy too especially when
*  we reach the point that we have in mixed martial arts you know I think that we've we've turned the
*  corner in that meaning the fact that there's there's so many so much out there so much knowledge
*  out there in the sport and everything else like that if you're going to be judging it you got to
*  at least know when somebody is is winning a round I mean you know there's aspects of John's game
*  that that was you know a score some points you know he was always moving forward with the action
*  but you know even when he was moving forward the action he wasn't terribly too offensive he would
*  come with his legs but you know a lot of times he would allow he would allow Dominic to kind of be
*  the first one initiated and then moving off and sometimes it seemed like he was just kind of chasing
*  him but um you know I think that it was it was that third round that third round was that that
*  hard round to score but you know it's I I think that Dom had the edge but if you're going to beat
*  the champ then you got to beat the champ and I don't think he did that John Jones oppressed me
*  so much with the shots that he was able to take but more or less the mindset that John had that
*  that their mindset that John had in those championship rounds to me that that showed
*  that this guy is you know he is a total package and when it comes to fighting just mentally
*  speaking you know he's he's somebody who I fought thought that was frustrated and
*  working through his own frustrating in the fight for his frustration in the fight
*  is difficult and he didn't succumb to his own frustration and and he just kept that pressure
*  going and took some big shots from a heavy hitter but uh Dominic Ray is a problem for anybody he's
*  a problem he's a real problem especially now that he's got that rub he touched touched greatness
*  with John who's the greatest ever I feel like those last two rounds should count more this is
*  my personal opinion but uh John Cavanaugh said something on his Twitter page I believe
*  it was John Cavanaugh and it reflects exactly how I feel that if this fight was going to go on
*  another five rounds it's pretty fucking clear to me who's going to win who's going to who this is
*  to the death John Jones is going to win that fight you know it's if it's to the death there's no doubt
*  about it in my mind that John Jones is eventually going to get him yeah those last two rounds
*  Dominic Ray was hurting you could see him looking and taking big deep breaths and trying to move and
*  his arms were labored and John just kept pressing kept pressing kept kicking him kept punching him
*  kept trying for the takedown and that should mean more it should mean more towards the end of the
*  fight at the end of the fight if you win a decision but you just got your ass kicked for the last four
*  minutes that seems crazy to me that you won the fight yeah because I mean I know this is a dumb
*  way to think about it but if we were in a schoolyard right we're in high school and some dude and
*  another dude fought the dude who's getting the shit beat out of them at the end of the fight is
*  the guy who lost right right when the teachers come and they pull you off that guy that's who won
*  that's who won and I know that you can't score a professional sport the way you look but it is the
*  rarest of rare professional sports because it's the sport of fighting right and in fighting when
*  you're getting your ass kicked you were you know you're supposed to you're supposed to lose if
*  you're getting your ass kicked you lost yeah and if you're kicking the guy's ass you win sounds
*  crazy but at the end of that fight John Jones was kicking Dominic Raiz's ass he was he was chasing
*  him down Dominic was taking a big deep breath he was firing back when he fired back very well in
*  the fourth round but John absorbed John has a fucking hell of a chin too oh my hell of a chin
*  oh my god a hell of a chin I mean you can't he's he's something special because of everything it's
*  not he's something special because of his physical attributes he's very tall and long he's very
*  strong it's not just his skill he's got great wrestling he's got great striking it is all in
*  his mind too yeah it's all those things he it's his ability to press forward its ability to break
*  people his ability to stay on top of you have that champion's mindset and to know that he's
*  fought the majority of his career as a world champion which is fucking crazy I mean almost
*  a decade as the greatest in the world chasing everybody that he's fought every single fighter
*  that he's fought you look at them they're all guys like you guys like machida world champions
*  rampage world champions over and over and over again you go through the list of them just all
*  these killers there's this killer after killer Gustafson you know I mean you just keep going
*  through his entire career DC twice stopped him in the second fight he's a fucking assassin and
*  the most impressive thing about it for me is the fact that you know on a physical scale he's
*  phenomenal but just mentally speaking to be able to go through everything that he's gone through
*  the ups and downs and what that does to your mind and just being able to put that to a side
*  or be able to use it in order to go out and still perform as if he hasn't missed a beat
*  that is hard because it gets to the point you get with anything in life you get tired of the
*  monotony of it you get jaded by it and he hasn't been jaded by it and he still goes out there and
*  performs like that that's impressive I think he needed someone like Dominic to get that fear
*  going too I think he knew Dominic Reyes physically is a talented guy he's a great athlete he has
*  tremendous footwork his ability to change angles and then fire back is insane it's so good he saw
*  it in the osp fight where he knocked him out with like a couple seconds to go you see it in a lot
*  is Jared can a near fight he could step back and fire fire uppercut step back and fire that straight
*  left his ability to change direction is amazing and I think a lot of that could be attributed to
*  his football basketball I mean um baseball like footwork movement his ability to explode all that
*  stuff that he did in other sports I think directly translates to his ability to move really well
*  inside the octagon and then on top of it he's gigantic he's the same size as John which is very
*  unusual for John to face someone that's his height and he's really fucking strong too that's it that
*  was no that was the intangible that I think that John didn't expect he didn't expect for him to be
*  as strong as he was when he's able to get back up every time like shit like get up like he wasn't
*  even on him yeah dang his legs are fucking huge you look at Reyes his legs oh huge yeah I mean
*  he's got tremendous power I mean both with his punches but also with his ability to move man he
*  was throwing great kicks he was chopping at John's legs I mean I out of any fight in John's future
*  I want to see a rematch I really want to see what Dominic Reyes looks like now with this rub
*  understanding how close he was and then the the amount of conditioning that he's going to have to
*  put himself through to be able to do that again five rounds and it's not like either guy got
*  fucked up in that fight where they're going to be severely damaged it's not like one of those crazy
*  wars where like Adesanya Kelvin Gastelum at the end of that fight I was like oh my god you know I
*  hope Kelvin takes some time off after that one that was chaos just wildness it wasn't like that
*  it was a grueling difficult hard fight but it wasn't a fight where there was so much damage
*  that both John and and Dominic needed to take a long time off I feel like you could make that
*  fight in eight months absolutely and that would be the fight to make that's that is a that's a
*  crazy rematch and the thing about it was surprisingly to see like they like their faces weren't beat up
*  at all and I'm like these dudes were landing some shots on each other and their faces not even
*  yes like I thought for sure John's lip would be all swollen like it was when he fought Augustus
*  yeah he took he took those shots well man it's it's amazing it's amazing but I think that this is
*  exactly what John needed in that light heavyweight weight class because you know it does it was
*  getting kind of stagnant and I think it needed some time to mature but I think I think Dominic
*  Reyes just said you better stay here for a little bit and here's another guy Corey Anderson oh yes
*  Corey Anderson oh yes listen that's the dark horse I've been telling everybody listen that's the dark
*  horse the way he knocked out Johnny Walker and he's angry he's angry he's angry and that's something
*  you've never seen Corey yes you've never seen that before after that fight he was like letting
*  everybody know you've been slipping yeah you've been sleeping on me you guys have been pretending
*  that I don't exist that's that's why I'm out here beating the best in the world if he fights John
*  Jones I think that's one that John better be like all right he better be so ready yeah Corey's got
*  he doesn't have a chip he's got logs on his shoulder I know Corey he's angry he's pissed he's pissed
*  after that Johnny Walker fight he was so out of character he's screaming and yelling and fucking
*  you know he was so he was angry after he won he knocked him out in the first round and then he's
*  bad the the years of disrespect though and that's how he trained though he always trained with that
*  that mind said like oh they don't respect me you know that's why he worked so hard yes his endurance
*  is insane his pace is insane yeah training alongside those guys in Jersey was probably
*  one of the best experiences in my career training with Mark Henry was was mind-blowing you were
*  telling me about this you and I had this long conversation about that tell me what it's like
*  to work with that guy Mark Henry is is a genius you know what he does is he breaks down the game like
*  no one ever ever trained with before so for every combination that we throw every punch
*  is all accounted for with a code and that code is specific to to you and and to what's in important
*  in your life and the way you value so he sits and he talks talks to you about you know your family
*  whatnot and then you know he'll make these codes up and these codes would just be like for a
*  combination of be I say jab cross hook you know then he'll say that is that's Nia that's my
*  daughter's name and then he'll make a whole whole system of codes with just names and then when
*  you're sparring he'll call off the name and you just got to know what that technique goes to wow
*  there's there's a bunch of different techniques for different colors for different movement and
*  you know he can have he just says it and it's like he's like when I watch him go with Frankie
*  because Frankie has a system down the best for it's like he's controlling Frankie like a like a like a
*  game and he's just saying xbox controller yeah he's just saying these commands and Frankie hears him
*  and then he goes off and you know sometimes like if if I'm going and I don't see it he'll say
*  something I don't see it I'll like nod it off and then he'll he'll say another one but if he says it
*  then most of the time I just do it because he sees it and right you know that's crazy to have that
*  kind of confidence in another person it's well that's that well that's that's the part of the
*  training that that you learn and then you know you kind of the good side to that is that you
*  it makes it easier for when you're just out there fighting sometimes it can be difficult if you
*  are too dependent on it and you just kind of lose the ability to create yourself you know
*  but for the most part he does such a good job of breaking it down that it's it's pretty easy but
*  it is a it is a very technical system to learn and anybody who gets a chance to work with Mark Henry
*  I suggest you do it because and here's another thing Mark Henry is one of those guys like I
*  stayed at his house when I first went to stay with him and he doesn't sleep like he'll stay up to like
*  two three o'clock in the morning watching film and then he'll go to sleep for a couple hours and he'll
*  wake up at like seven seven in the morning to go do his uh for his pizza shop because he owns a pizza
*  shop and he has this crazy work schedule but he he loves fighting it's so weird that a guy runs a
*  successful pizza business and he's also one of the best trainers in the world yes it's so strange
*  and he makes a killing day with his pizza shop he kills it I heard his basement gym is amazing
*  oh it is it is amazing his basement gym is where all the magic happens man he uh he has all the
*  codes written out and he he torture he torture you in that basement he'll torture you he'll get
*  your mindset like sharp as hell but he'll torture that basement you know well it's so such a diverse
*  group of fighters right Zabit comes down there Marlon Morais he had so many interesting guys
*  Edson Barboza so many interesting guys have gone through that gym it's so crazy like when I first
*  like I was standing I got to train with Zabit a little bit and got to live with Zabit and
*  in the Russian the Dagestan fighters so it's pretty pretty cool experience because you know
*  you kind of get to know their culture and just kind of just uh just get a different respect for
*  it you know and those guys are just hard work of those Dagestan guys they're so hard they they
*  work hard they pray hard they they just are very very focused individuals and you watch them you're
*  like okay you know even I'm like you know what maybe I need to get a little bit more serious
*  about my thing you know but uh that's where the the success comes from that's that's it think
*  about how many great fighters come out of that region I mean it's really it's extraordinary
*  yeah and these guys are phenomenal like I watch them after training and these guys do um this this
*  uh like it's like a randori type of sparring afterwards and they just do like jumping off
*  the walls all these kind of like these acrobatic crazy moves that you don't think are ever working
*  you seem like oh my god where do you get that from they practice it all the time and they just
*  they just they just do all these kind of crazy moves at the end of training and at the end of
*  training at the end of training like so they're done with all the real work let's just fuck around
*  and see if we get creative yeah they get creative and they just start just doing all kinds of stuff
*  and they you know throw real moves in there but they just they drill everything and the beat that
*  dude is the beat is probably like one of the best guys I've ever seen in training just like like
*  martial arts wise this guy yeah he jumps off the cage and do all kinds of acrobats and come down
*  doing all kinds of ground acrobats and he just he just makes it look so effortless and easy it's
*  crazy he is really good he's he's really good with his mixture of traditional martial arts
*  techniques you know because he has that kung fu background so he throws a lot of like round kicks
*  and spinning kicks and all that kind of crazy shit but then he'll hit you with like some judo
*  shit a lot of tosses and trips yeah and he's got great submissions too I mean he's got great
*  wrestling he's got great boxing I mean he's a weird combination of a bunch of different styles
*  and he's tall too that tall that the tall length is is really um it's something that helps him out
*  too because Frank Jagger whenever he goes on him he's like man I feel like I can get him down but
*  then I look down and then his feet are still touching the ground I swear I have him up
*  so tall for 145 I'll tell you what though he had a hard time in his last fight with Calvin Cater
*  that dude that dude is fucking dangerous Cater's a dog he's a dog he's a dog he's the dark horse
*  at 45 in my opinion because he was beating Zabit in that last round and it was rough like Zabit
*  was trying to just get the fuck away from him and he just stays on him and I think he has the best
*  boxing in that division and he's also huge for 45 yes he is you stand next to him you're like how
*  the fuck are you weighing 145 yeah he looks like he's a 160 yeah he doesn't look anything like
*  145 I know it seemed like in that fight Cater kind of realized towards the end like wait a minute I
*  can beat this dude you know yeah and that happens sometimes when you go against a guy who has like
*  a bunch of different tricks you find yourself putting your putting yourself in his trick bag
*  just by being aware of all the things that he can do you find yourself like oh he's going to set that
*  up oh he's going to set that up and by you being too watchful of what he's doing you're shutting
*  your own game down and it seemed like Cater just threw caution to the wind that third round was
*  like you know what I'm going to go out and just make it happen and then when he did that he found
*  his opportunities I think also the first two rounds were really fast paced and I think in the
*  third round Cater was the one who was in better condition he was the one who was pressing the
*  pace in the third round and he was also landing body shots like some nasty nasty body shots that
*  we're adding up he's he's a fascinating guy Calvin Cater I'm really interested to see him
*  he's fighting Jeremy Stevens next which should be fucking chaos because Jeremy Stevens is another
*  savage he only fights one way and that's you know kill or be killed see I feel like guys like that
*  don't even need to win they just need to go out there and just fight because like like his fighting
*  is so good you just want to see him go out there just fight man yeah well he's had so many oh shit
*  moments in his career like Dennis Bermudez he hits him with that flying knee up against the cage
*  you know he Josh Emmett that the ko Josh Emmett he fucks people up man and he's got ridiculous
*  power too and with Calvin's boxing and Jeremy's savagery the two of them together and Jeremy has
*  ridiculous power the two of them together that's going to be amazing and then they have Zabit
*  Zabit is now going to fight Ortega Brian Ortega's comeback fight is going to be Zabit and that's a
*  tough fight to come back to Ortega's been out injured a bunch hasn't fought since he lost to
*  Max he's had a bunch of like real problematic injuries that he can't get get over and then
*  finally he's healthy now he's going through training and you know tall order though to jump
*  right back in the deep end of the pool with a guy like Zabit but you know what though like sometimes
*  it is a tall order but sometimes like when you like when you just came from a big fight that's
*  the kind of fight it's easier to get up for like like if he like he just came from title
*  you know challenging for the title right it'd be hard for him to to take a two five a step down
*  in competition because then it's right then it's gonna be hard to get himself up for it but if
*  he's taking a step kind of like in in in a you know in an upward motion then it's like okay I
*  can get up for this right and then he can train for it you know yeah because the beat is I don't
*  know what the official ranking is in my book he's two or three right he's right there he's right at
*  the top of the heap in my book I mean there's Volkanovsky he's the champ there's Max Holloway
*  they have to fight again they have to they're gonna fight again and then after that it's basically
*  Zabit and Kader that's that's how I look at it and then a bunch of other guys now that Aldo's down
*  to two thirty five which is real interesting because Aldo is going to fight Triple C he's
*  gonna fight Cejudo that's interesting yes that is for the title that is interesting very interesting
*  I thought Aldo looked the best that he's looked in a long time at 135 yeah he looked amazing he
*  looked like a bit like the all although minus the kicks he didn't yes minus the kicks I wonder why
*  he doesn't throw so many kicks anymore I don't know he has injuries or something he might have
*  an injury I think he don't want to take a chance of his hurt yeah hurting something and then having
*  to fight through it you know right and compromised but it's crazy because his kicks were just such a
*  devastating weapon I mean he'll only need like two or three of them right change the whole
*  complexion of the fight one like when he fought Uriah yeah but imagine now imagine that that
*  power of leg kick to the lower calf like how they oh my gosh yeah yeah maybe as a knee thing maybe
*  he can't throw those kicks his knees are fucked up I don't know I'd like to know because that was
*  one of his primary weapons but still even without that I felt like he beat Marais I felt like that
*  was a bad decision but he's you know he's fighting Marais who's easily one of the best 35ers on
*  earth Marais is so good man that left high switch kick that he has is a thing of beauty
*  yeah the way he whips it it's like a whip it's crazy like it's effortless it just goes to your
*  head yeah Marlin Marlin is pretty sick man he's beautiful is this although throwing some kicks
*  oh okay so four days ago oh okay it's practice but looks normal looks normal looks normal
*  I don't see any problems except the sound's all fucked up see it's different though it's
*  it's different when you got to crack somebody's leg you know yeah gosh it's I think that um
*  I think honestly when when it comes to you know the state of mixed martial arts I think that
*  you know once a lot of these fighters start to like because we're speaking about it earlier like
*  we were in a dark ages when it came to training and that transition of how to become more
*  professional with your training you know and I think nowadays fighters are starting to
*  understand that more you know with the you know the performance institute it's helping to educate
*  these fighters a lot more on what proper training should be yeah and what it truly could encompass
*  you know and now there's more professionalism added to martial arts but there's still an aspect
*  that needs to be covering and that's on the equipment side you know like um the equipment
*  that the the company that I work with onyx have you heard on yes yeah I have a pair of the gloves
*  okay excellent excellent very very good so we have a whole line and this is the line that we have with
*  onyx it's it's really the first mma branded like an mma company that's made for all the the way we
*  move in mma you know everything that happens in mma because now the equipment that we use now
*  we borrow it from kickboxing or boxing and there's that gap of just efficiency when it comes to
*  manufacturing uh for mixed martial art because they kickboxing they don't have to worry about
*  all the things that we have to worry about when it comes to mixed martial art so the equipment
*  that trevor has made is all with that in mind you know the the gloves that we we made you try the
*  x-factor gloves yeah trevor whitman sent them to me yeah so is it he designed them yeah he so trevor
*  trevor's a genius he's another genius oh my gosh an absolute genius so he started so what happened
*  is when we were trained if anything happened to our equipment we would just give it to trevor and
*  trevor would go and he'll tweak it and he'll make some adjustments so then trevor's like man you know
*  he's like man the more he started to do that the more he started to realize there's a huge
*  gap like the equipment that we're we're using is not efficient you know some gloves that should be
*  you know 16 ounces are actually 11 ounces you know and every there's no integrity when it comes to
*  equipment so trevor did a lot of research and he was like man there really hasn't been
*  any improving on equipment since the thumb was put on the boxing glove you know and that's that's
*  pretty much it so trevor went and he learned how to sew he learned how to do everything and he
*  was in his basement just making this equipment you know he's um he's made uh the x-factor glove you
*  have yeah there you go and so and he's good at like at first i didn't i didn't realize how in depth
*  it was until i went to his basement and seen the little shop that he had but it's pretty high tech
*  so we have the the the glove the x-factor glove but we have a knee brace and we have a um a head
*  gear to the knee brace um not the knee brace it's the uh knee sleeve it's like it's like a knee
*  it's a it's a shin guard but it slides into a knee brace you can slide you can slide it's like
*  a knee brace at the same time as well as an ankle brace it secures the whole like whole leg pretty
*  much and it's it feels like you have nothing on and you can kick with like anything and it feels
*  feel it doesn't feel like it feels amazing and he has a really really thin head gear and uh i
*  want to show you these gloves i brought some gloves to show you uh so these gloves right here
*  are what um we're going to be doing uh for the competition gloves the competition and the training
*  gloves the seven ounce training gloves so pretty much what these are so this one is the
*  so has he developed a different glove for mma for competition as well yeah so this is ufc seen these
*  because they need to make some adjustments clearly we're talking with the ufc but these are yeah so
*  these are the ones curved i like how it's curved curved so it sets up that you are in a curved
*  position already on because when you as you know when you get the gloves now they're like a cardboard
*  they want to open your hand yeah they always want to open your hands this allows your hands to stay
*  in a natural fist locked position and you don't got to worry about that these are getting on
*  yeah big hands
*  oh yeah okay so it's curved right away yeah and then when you that's way better
*  yeah like the old pride gloves yeah yeah good padding too so it's
*  i like them a lot these are definitely better than the ones ufc is using right now yeah
*  yeah yeah so so it's you know if you see the x wrapping system in there that that also goes
*  in there so then that way it makes it so that your um your your hand you don't get the box and break
*  on your hand it keeps everything all the muscles all the all the ligaments and and uh bones in place
*  so that way when you're punching everything is is in form so this is it says grappling glove
*  fight yes grappling glove and fight glove so these ones were the ones at the factory and i
*  had to hurry up and get these out just so i can i wanted to show you these so this one is is um
*  this one is is going to be like the training the training one but we're going to put a different
*  different uh head on the front of it what's going to be different about it it's going to be just
*  the the top is going to be different a little bit more so you can punch with like you can oh hit it
*  with the side hit it with the side it'd be it'd be a little bit like this got some side panning
*  yeah but definitely better than nothing be a side pattern like this a little bit you know so so it's
*  going to be a bit bigger so that way right you can hit like that and train like casting punches like
*  those right i like these a lot i like these a lot yeah i mean this is i mean this but trevor's
*  whole thing man you know is all about making it so that fighters can do what they enjoy doing a lot
*  longer and be healthy about it you know and he he's he trevor's trevor's a g when it comes to
*  uh adjusting and making what he needs to for the fighter so they can so they can continue to do
*  what they want to do um he's a judge like he's made he's made head gears for people to so because
*  the one one of these fighters had a broken nose and he made a head gear and head gear that he made
*  with this guy it was it was sick how does this work this is weird because it's like both sides
*  are male let's see here oh yeah so this this is um let me see it goes it goes on the inside
*  it goes on the inside how does that work yeah it goes on the inside i gotta see okay probably some
*  weird shit you gotta talk to trevor about it let me see or maybe it goes this way first oh i bet
*  that's exactly yeah i bet it goes this way first yeah so you can put yeah that's that's exactly how
*  it goes like that oh that is exactly what it is yeah so you can pull the strap on it yeah and then
*  the strap goes over okay i say and the strap goes over the top these are great man well there's
*  definitely room for improvement the current state of mma gloves are the ones that ufc uses
*  they're they're better than the original ones that they had a few years back you know they improved
*  them maybe eight or nine years ago or whatever it was but still those are better well see i mean and
*  that's and that's where we are at onyx you know we just want to be able to get a product out there
*  for the athletes and that they can they can use but it protects them because a lot of a lot of the
*  injuries like 75 percent of them happen in training sure you know and if we can kind of cut that number
*  down then they can have a lot more of these fighters making these dates yeah and for the
*  most part for these fighters you can actually you know for you can have gear that protects you
*  and you don't got to suffer these long injuries like these acls right you know it helped mitigate
*  some of those things well you were a big part of the black zillions getting started yeah and
*  when you had that opportunity uh as a guy who was a former world champion to go there and sort of
*  get become a part of a team from the ground up what did you try to do that was different
*  than had you had seen in other camps that you had participated in i wanted to make it just like a
*  you know the biggest thing back then it was it was that there was you always had to go to so
*  many different places in order to just get that one thing so i really wanted to just make it so
*  that our guys didn't have a need to go anywhere else for anything else and that was the whole
*  idea behind the whole black zillions you know we brought in all kinds of people from every different
*  aspect from you know training to to uh to nutrition almost every aspect of it and um
*  that's what we wanted to provide our athletes with just like the total the total game so they
*  really didn't have to do anything or worry about anything except for showing up the train and um
*  it worked for a while it worked for a while but but it's uh it's a hard thing to maintain because
*  that's in a very very expensive thing you know yes well glenn the guy who put up the cash i mean i
*  had heard some outlandish figures that he had uh was in the hole for that place for by the time
*  everything was up and running yeah yeah it was um it was a pretty it was a pretty pretty happy
*  ticket man it was a pretty happy ticket and it was uh it was it was an expense that um it did
*  get out of hand it did get out of sure yeah he um he and and here's and here's the thing about it
*  like even even his situation though he got himself in a situation where he was doing so much for
*  people it just became a thing that people expected out of him and then when he wasn't able to do it
*  anymore then it was kind of like you know people were like oh man this guy isn't this and he wasn't
*  that but right he just he just wanted to do so much and had an idea to want to do to do things
*  on another level but at the same time you know the the finances of of doing it was a massive
*  undertaking i'm sure i mean all credit to dan lambert because dan lambert he's been doing this
*  from the beginning yeah that fucking guy i mean he is the reason why these super camps got started
*  dan lambert put his own money and then the new att they built he built himself from the ground up
*  built the whole fucking building and you know i've i haven't seen in person i have friends that have
*  gone to visit it but i've seen it in videos and holy shit it's phenomenal i went inside of it dan's
*  the man yeah he really is dan dan is a good guy man um you know after the whole thing with the black
*  zillions you know him and i got got to have a chance to spend some time together and just
*  and just and just talk you know right there was so much weird animosity it was weird the ufc put
*  that show together yeah it's like i inherited beef with people that i didn't even know i didn't even
*  say hello to them you know i'm saying it's so crazy and i just inherited this beef and i was like you
*  know it's silly and especially the fact that att is like literally right down the street from my
*  house it would be closer to go there than anywhere else but it was weird for a while but actually
*  talking to dan and actually getting to know him and you know it was um it was it was a good it
*  was a good thing because uh you know i got i got to get a lot of respect for for him and just for
*  what he's done with american top team and att in general no he's a he's a brilliant guy i'm i love
*  that guy as a person i'm a big fan of his i just love that a person like that like dan lambert can
*  literally change the course of mma by setting an example yeah and by having a gym that sets an
*  example that's such an insanely high level so big so many world class fighters there so much strength
*  conditioning everything under one roof dorms everything well see i think that was that was
*  the thing that that kind of you know that that kind of pushed things uh in that in that position
*  for glenn you know right he had to keep up he had to keep up or he was trying to outdo yeah he was
*  trying to do uh dan lambert i always wanted to do something that dan wasn't doing you know so
*  good luck with that yeah it's a good way to go broke that's a good way to spend a lot of money
*  i'll tell you that yeah yeah there's i mean there's a lot of super camps out there now
*  it's interesting to see these places you have tri star in montreal you have you know duke
*  rufus in milwaukee you have jackson winkeljohn and albuquerque you got aka you know it's uh when you
*  first started there was not that many places no there really wasn't and and to even get what we
*  wanted out of it you know we there's three gyms that we can go through we'll go to either jackson's
*  and albuquerque we'll go to tri star in montreal or we'll go to denver and we'll work with trevor
*  whitman in denver so we had the three camps that we bounced around from and and um that's where
*  we are going to get the most work and it worked for a while you know work for a while for the
*  most part but just all that traveling it just became hard to do but that has to wear on you
*  when you're in the middle of a camp and you're yeah staying in hotels and yeah it it does like
*  um like when i was in camp i really wouldn't travel too much but like when so what we would
*  do is that um if if nate marquardt was in camp and he wanted to stay at home most of the time
*  so we'll stagger it where you know he'd have a tough guy in camp every single time so i'll be
*  a couple weeks when george wasn't there or when keith wasn't there you know and then sometimes
*  we'll all come together but for the most part we'll just all rotate into these gyms depending
*  on who was fighting who needed the work he's a guy that i feel is underappreciated nate marquardt
*  when he was at the very top of his game was a fucking assassin oh nate marquardt was that
*  knockout tyron woodley in strike force to this day is one of the nastiest in tight elbow combination
*  knockouts i think of like a video game knockout see nate marquardt was one of those guys i'm like
*  oh man you'll get anxiety before training and practice because you knew it was going to be a
*  hard go like my training growing going growing up in the sport was just it was difficult man you
*  know train with gsp keith jardine nate marquardt joey vila senior uh mike van arsdale and uh you
*  know even ali abdelaziz was even up in a mix too but it was you know it was it was training with
*  guys who like it was a hard go all the time you know and uh and nate was one of those guys then
*  i'm just like oh my gosh this dude is not going to get tired you know what i'm saying he's good
*  everywhere he's super strong it was just like one of those one of those one of those like all right
*  i got to bring it in order to compete today yeah he was in that he had this weird transition between
*  ufc and strike force where people kind of forgot about him and then when he came back to the ufc
*  you know he had some real good fights but he had already had a really long career yeah he had
*  already had some really tough fights and then really tough fights in training too right yeah yeah and
*  that's the thing like back then we we weren't really too too smart like greg would kill us
*  in training like we'd do some shit that you'd be like oh my gosh like one time greg had us
*  doing like some buddy carries we're on the side of the sandia mountains and there was like you
*  know it's like two or three feet and you'll fall to like your death and then we had to do like these
*  buddy carries these wedding carriers where i'm holding keith like this get the fuck out of here
*  yeah and you like this you'll fall to your death like if you if you make a mistake you know there
*  wasn't much room for mistake if i would have fell down then we would have we would have fell but uh
*  you take and we had to rotate every 60 steps fuck that and greg and greg was like greg was always
*  on the like you know like mental like yo you gotta be ready to die you gotta be ready to face death
*  let's let's get it seek death meanwhile he's such a sweetie in the corner i know in the corner he's
*  hey how you doing rachad oh my gosh he's looking great he'll take us that's why he does it because
*  he knows what he did to in training
*  i can't imagine that buddy carries or wedding carry like that and you're
*  literally if you fall you die you both die yeah and then there was like one little slip and he's
*  like all right let's let's change things up go on his back and i'm like what yeah fuck out of here
*  greg you go on his back bitch what are you doing what are you talking about yeah that's so crazy
*  it was crazy man but that was um that was a good time just mental toughness training huh
*  yeah that was a mental toughness training well you guys that albuquerque team is always known
*  for having crazy endurance i mean that had to come from some of that grit had to come from those
*  hill workouts yeah we had a lot of grit because of those workouts that we did we did one where we do
*  uh the sand dunes was the worst and you you cry like you had to carry somebody up doing the sand
*  dunes and then if you didn't carry them all the way up then you had to do it again until you
*  compete until you completed it like you would like you would literally see grown ass men crying just
*  like i can't do no more that's a good way to get injured too though unfortunately yes like there's
*  this fine line between pushing really hard and fucking somebody up yes yes you know yeah i think
*  now they've kind of figured it out but just the the mental aspect it paid off big dividends like
*  and i'll talk to danan white and dan like bro you were so fucking crazy back then you were so
*  paranoid i'm like i'm like your danan white impression yeah yeah you were paranoid back then
*  i mean i mean i was a fighter man fighters are always paranoid you have to be paranoid if you're
*  a fighter you have to think that everybody's trying to take something from you right it's just it's
*  just the mindset but he'll say i was crazy i was paranoid because i didn't really trust him back
*  then but i'm just he's a promoter right and then and then on top of that you know you had you had
*  greg greg greg jackson always telling you like you know that they want to they want to get you out of
*  it man they want to get you out the ufc man go ahead and just go ahead and just just quit evans
*  just quit right now man i know you want to give up they want to get you out of here anyways man
*  like no no i ain't gonna quit and show them you're not gonna quit i don't want to see it let's go
*  jesus christ yeah it's it's um it's it was a good time over there when you first started fighting
*  how much striking training had you done before you decided to compete in mma because you had this
*  wrestling base um did you have any striking training growing up did you do any boxing i did
*  some boxing yeah and i did uh some some karate too i did tank sudo oh okay yeah i did tank sudo for
*  a few years from the time i was like uh 13 to like 16 that makes sense because you always had good
*  kicks yeah yeah like that sean sam and knockout but you know i never i never utilized my kicks
*  like i should have and my mom will always be like every time and rishad listen joe roger joe she
*  always says something that joe roger said rishad joe roger said you need to pass the guard rishad
*  i'm like i don't even know what the shit is what the guard is talking about i need to pass the
*  guard like what oh my god that's hilarious when i fought sean sam and she she's the one who told
*  me to throw rishad throw your kicks like bruce lee rishad and then when i threw the kick and
*  and the next day i talked to her on the phone she said rishad that was a good kick and i was like
*  okay but i don't like that dirty shit though and i was like mom what you talking about
*  rishad you knew he was knocked out you didn't have to hit him again oh wow your mom said that
*  ma you can't tell you just got to keep going like the the referee say don't stop until i stop you
*  and i was just in the fight and she said but still rishad shit
*  oh that's so funny yeah i was kind of surprised that you were
*  an head kicking more people unconscious after that you know i that's the thing man i needed i
*  needed to really really step out of my game and make sure i stepped out of my game more and more
*  often but i just you know after i switched switched things up and went and went from uh
*  you know jackson's to uh to florida it was different because mike winklejohn he was my guy
*  like it was like me and mike winklejohn uh had a really good relationship and he would uh he would
*  work with me and we and a lot of times we would work together it was like it was like a counseling
*  session we would just talk about life you know what i'm saying in between and between stuff we'd
*  talk about everything and uh it was a fun training session you know and and that's when you know he'll
*  instill in me all these different things you know he would like oh yeah that kick is gonna work that
*  kick is gonna work you know even with the overhand right when i caught chuck ladel he was telling me
*  oh yeah that's the kick that's the that's the punch is gonna catch him that's gonna catch him
*  that when i when i caught chuck the day before i was hitting that move because i was super nervous
*  and i was hitting the overhand right and then left hook combination and then he said oh yeah that's
*  that's gonna be the punch you know you're gonna hit him with that and you're gonna knock him out
*  and and i'm not gonna be able to get into the cage and congratulate you that's what he said to me
*  word for word i'm just like no way and then it happened i looked at him i was like oh
*  shit it happened just like you said that was like a gunshot i remember that shot i remember you
*  landed that shot the smack of your fist hitting chuck and then seeing chuck crumbles like holy
*  shit was that your most satisfying victory yeah i think so i i i it definitely was just because like
*  going into that fight job like the the media sometimes can be so damn disrespectful you know
*  what i'm saying like they were just kind of like the questioning was like you know what have you
*  even done to fight a guy like chuck ladel like people are asking me i mean pretty much in so
*  many words like you know what have i even done but you would already at that point in time
*  had you fought for the title no that was before you fought for the title yeah before i fought for the
*  title i just it was the fight before the fight before right fight before yeah i only got a chance
*  to fight for the title because i beat chuck laden chuck ladel was supposed to fight for the title
*  that i was a serve up to fight for the title oh wow yeah wow yeah that was that was a server
*  well the media was a little sloppy back then yeah so so there's some really good guys out there now
*  and gals that are covering mma where they're real journalists they really are like real sports
*  journalists back then it was like anybody with a camera who liked fights was also a lot of people
*  that were trying to get attention just by being douchey yeah there's a lot of douchey sports guy
*  talk i fucking hate that stuff that that was driving me crazy would be real disrespectful
*  to fighters real dismissive of fighters so going into the fight i felt that disrespect and i was
*  like you know what man all right i'm like i don't care what happens i'm like this i got i got a
*  leash at least give a good showing for myself you know and that's and that's all i really cared about
*  doing you know i went out i walked out to the song um immortal technique is called that's my boy
*  yeah i love that dude he's my friend oh yeah he's cool man i love him yeah i came out to the song
*  point of no return and that song just really solidified everything i was feeling at that
*  moment you know like like it you know there's a verse in there it says you know the place that
*  i'm from doesn't exist anymore and i knew after i walked out to that fight you know life would never
*  be the same whether i won or lost so that was the big moment that was the big moment there was no
*  i was not going to be the same rishad after that fight no matter what happened a moral technique
*  has such great lyrics oh my god he's so smart so smart dude i'm so politically aware geopolitically
*  aware he's got so much depth to his lyrics i love that dude yeah he's he's like one of those guys
*  you listen to and you just kind of keep putting it back yeah he just oh shit he's got a lot of oh
*  shit lyrics oh shit a lot of things that he says you know you go and you look it up afterwards
*  like okay you know he definitely had me uh looking up some things after i listened to him
*  dude you fought won the ultimate fighter as a heavyweight which is so crazy i know because
*  if you look at me now i'm like what do you weigh now about yeah what do you weigh now what are you
*  walking around i'm consisting like 200 200 pounds 200 pounds wow yeah that is like a 170 now yeah in
*  this day and age yeah 200 200 pounds but i feel but i feel good though man i feel really really
*  good and um it's it's a level that i i didn't expect it i didn't expect to feel this good
*  i didn't think that a diet can make me feel this good what is what is particularly makes you feel
*  so good in what way um my energy i have an energy level that it's really hard to to say it kind of
*  feels uh a bit supernatural in a bit you know like i feel i feel energy like i feel
*  i feel like my body's energy it feels it's kind of hard to say it's kind of like not not hard to say
*  it's kind of hard to describe without looking crazy but you're obviously by following this vegan
*  diet i'm seeing all these supplements you're taking spirulina and all these different things
*  you're obviously doing it right which is you know there's a lot of people that they're they're vegan
*  but they're eating like pasta and pizza and shit like that they're just not they're not doing it
*  correctly in terms of taking the proper amount of nutrients right and that's and that's the thing
*  about it like i um i read this book the mucusless diet and it's by uh dr arnold errett and this is
*  like in the early 1900s he came up with this book and he had uh some stomach issues and it was you
*  know not until he was fed up and was on like you know what i'm like he was starving himself and then
*  he realized he had some really you know uh it kind of changes his his stomach situation so then
*  he started looking into diet and nutrition and then he um he became a fruitarian and this book
*  is talking about pretty much you know the role of food in your body and and what it does and what
*  causes mucus and what doesn't cause mucus and um you know through understanding the mucus has died
*  just reading it it just gave me a different hold on understanding like a different understanding of
*  why i'm doing this you know and it came it became to me deeper than just like oh i can't have this
*  because you know the diet says i shouldn't have it it says i can't have it because you know this is
*  going to cause inflammation you know i i have i know the deeper reason of why so it's easier for
*  me to avoid the pitfalls of bad food you know there's also a situation with people where
*  there's everyone there's biological variability where some people some diets just sync up well
*  for them like i know i know a lot of people that they don't feel good when they eat red meat when
*  they eat fish they feel great yeah when they eat light foods you know their their body whatever
*  for whatever it is their digestion favors certain type of diet yeah and that's what i found too
*  because um uh i don't i don't know if this will work for everybody it probably won't work for
*  i mean it most likely won't work for everybody but for me uh it was it was something that my
*  body just was like oh it's about time you started to start to treat us the right way you know
*  interesting and the crazy part about it is the fact that now i train less but i can train harder like
*  now i can do sparring sessions where like i spar for like an hour straight really yeah and i'm and
*  i'm sparring at a pretty good pace like i'm not um like like it's it's smart sparring like we're
*  not like bashing each other in the head and shit like that we just we're we're being smart about
*  it you know we're doing um you know a little bit lighter to the head but more more heavy shots to
*  the body you know making those ones count um and just kind of like touch you know giving a nice
*  shot to the head but not a like i'm gonna knock you out right right what type of foods are you
*  eating like how are you what is it give me a typical meal for you um typically speaking uh
*  it all depends on the time of the day but but i don't eat in the morning i fast up until noon
*  or until like one o'clock and then my first are you on like a 16 hour 14 hour like 16 like 16 uh
*  intermittent fast and then um once i eat i usually eat like uh like i'll come home and i'll eat
*  you know maybe like a hearty hearty shake that i make a fruit and then i'll put some um you know
*  some some mushrooms and stuff in it and just like uh you know the quarter saps the the lions may
*  and you know from this uh brand life cycle sure you know your life cycle with okay so that brand
*  right there makes us you know really good tincture that you just drop it in there and you don't got
*  to worry about changing the flavor of too much of your shake so i drop that in there with my shakes
*  and stuff like that and um i usually take that that'd be my first meal then the second one would
*  be a little bit more hearty it'd be something with vegetables and maybe some potatoes or something
*  so it's a little bit more hearty and then i'll have another hearty uh meal like a vegetable type
*  meal vegetable based meal at night time and then um then i'll usually be done for the day are you
*  using any protein powders pea protein hemp protein anything on those lines no i don't i don't use any
*  just vegetables raw vegetables just raw vegetables raw vegetables and interesting yeah and and i don't
*  and i don't really feel like i uh like i have it like i have a need for like i feel like um
*  my muscle mass is pretty good like i don't feel like i'm i'm too skinny or like i don't i'm not
*  gaining any muscle i feel like i can gain muscle and uh you know it's just been working for me and
*  so basically just eat to feel good like however it makes you feel good yeah however and you've got it
*  down now you know like what kind of foods it's um the the supplement thing gets strange with vegans
*  you know there's a lot of folks that they're mixing a lot of different dietary yeasts and a
*  lot of different powders and different things and blending these different things and it's uh some
*  people don't like the way that feels when you're eating like that but it sounds like what you're
*  eating is much more whole food based yeah mine is just whole food based like a lot of the foods that
*  i became actually a good cook now because of the fact that i had to learn to cook my own food
*  my wife she was busy uh becoming you know busier on her own doing her own thing so she wasn't able
*  to cook for me like she was before but then i i learned myself and uh through learning myself it
*  just completely just like took the shackles off of off of me you know what i'm saying right took
*  nice meals yeah so now i um i cook a lot of like west indian style type of foods because they have
*  a really good vegetarian uh menu like a lot of chickpeas um and and things of that nature there's
*  a really good vegetarian indian place around here that i go to i love i love indian food yeah it's
*  really good i haven't gone a month because i've been on this carnivore diet but this uh this place
*  is fantastic really interesting weird you know vegetable dishes everything's vegetarian you know
*  it's uh i guess it's uh with them it's a religious thing a lot of a lot of indians are vegetarian
*  vegetarian and that and that's and i like a lot of indian food just because of that you know and
*  that whole food diet it just it just works for me but like um like you said like these supplements
*  like this this makes me like i feel like when i drink this like spirulina and just eat a lot
*  of greens and uh even even like the mushrooms you know the quarter step mushrooms and stuff like that
*  like i just have energy to just go and go and go that lifestyle cycle tincture somebody gave me
*  some of that yeah yes i gotta have them send you some i gotta have them send some they they send
*  like they have like a really nice tincture set that they sent out i should have bring it but um
*  it has like like has um uh reishi it has turkey tail lion's mane uh the quarter saps and and it
*  even gives you you know a schedule on when you should take it and when it's best for but it's um
*  it's a really really good good mushrooms because you know they they put they infuse theirs with this
*  uh it's it's it's cockatoo plum it's a cockatoo plum you ever hear that no it's funny name yeah i
*  know it's cockatoo plum is from australia and it's it's like one of the most high uh high in
*  vitamin c fruits there there is like it's way higher in vitamin c than oranges and everything
*  else like that and they do plum yeah cockatoo plum okay yeah k a k a d u that sounds like something
*  that a little kid right now that's a cockatoo plant yeah what but that's i mean they um it's
*  it's a really really good supplement and uh i don't really like to recommend supplements too much but
*  that's one that i i take and i'm like man i feel i feel way better off do you eat a lot of beets
*  i do i do i do i do beets are really good it's supposed to be really good for endurance
*  yeah beets are really good but it's crazy like just eating greens like i've been eating greens
*  i just don't i feel like i don't get tired like i used to like my body's just
*  instantly recovering what was your old diet like what would what was it like when you're training
*  for a fight what typical meals be like um it was pretty clean but it was uh i would eat a lot of
*  meat i would eat a lot of meat and and uh i'm o positive so i'll eat like a lot of red meat
*  and i felt really good when i ate red meat like it felt as if like when i eat red meat it almost
*  felt like i can feel it like within like the next 20 30 minutes like my body breaks it down really
*  fast you know so i felt i felt good eating it but i didn't feel like i i had the uh like the
*  endurance like i didn't feel the endurance aspect like i do right now you know i see what you're
*  saying so that that's been a like the best that i ever felt was when i um fought t2r cheese
*  i was eating i was eating red meat but i also was coupling that up with uh a lot of spinach
*  i was eating a lot of spinach like i would go and get a buy yeah get a big bag of spinach yeah
*  that's exactly what i was doing i'll get a big bag of spinach and i'll just put it in a blender
*  and just grind it up and then throw like some apples in it to make it a little bit sweeter
*  to change the taste so it wouldn't be so so greenish like i'm eating grass right and then
*  i would just drink those all the time but it just made me feel so strong interesting interesting
*  now did you used to work with the nutritionist at all i did yeah i did i worked with um
*  because when you were cutting weight like how many fights did you have at 85
*  uh two two fights was that too much of a struggle yeah it was too much of a struggle like i'm in a
*  weird position because i'm not i'm not i'm not a very big person i'm not big enough to be a light
*  heavy weight but i'm not small enough to be a middle weight either like and feel like i can
*  you know like so i was like in that weird weird space so when i cut down to 185 i felt like
*  it felt drained drained i just didn't have the the movement in the pop you know but then at 205 i
*  kind of felt undersized you know back then what did you walk around that back then i was walking
*  around around like 225 230 and what was different because it was from eating the meat yeah from
*  eating the meat from eating the meat i would get that alone has got to probably increase your
*  endurance just the loss of that much body mass yeah 20 plus pounds that your body doesn't have
*  to pump blood through yeah you're absolutely right about that you know yeah so that just came off
*  naturally when you stopped eating meat yeah and another thing too like i would i would um
*  you know this is another reason why like because when i wasn't fighting that was the problem
*  because i would get into these bad eating habits because i would always know that when i had training
*  camp i can just cut the weight and just right lose it like that but uh after a while that just becomes
*  your habit anything you do over time that becomes your habit it becomes your lifestyle and i was
*  eating a lot of sugar drinking a lot of booze and shit like that so i was like man i need to make a
*  change for my life for the rest of my life you know right and that's why this whole lifestyle
*  fits so much better to me you know do you think that would have changed your career had you eaten
*  this way back when you were competing i think so i think it would have but at the same time i don't
*  i don't know in which way you know right i feel like too chill yeah yeah i feel like so calm now
*  yeah i feel like i i was i was what i needed to be at the time i needed to be it you know i see
*  yeah and i feel like um there are some aspects of my of my awareness because that's that's what
*  what i would call it more than anything i hate to say oh i'm woke now because i hate that whole woke
*  thing but i feel i feel woke is great yeah but real woke but you know what it is the problem is
*  people could take it too far and then really it's about getting other people to comply with your
*  idea of wokeness and then it becomes almost like a religion yeah you just want want people to comply
*  with your ideas about how to speak and how to talk and how to live and exactly you just become a
*  dictator a little dictator that's what it is but the idea of like being woke meaning aware you're
*  you're spiritually cognizant of your effect on people the life that you live and that's all
*  beautiful that's great the problem is it gets abused because people want to pretend that they
*  have virtue so they adopt this woke pattern and then they try to force it on other people and
*  then they're fucking annoying and then it pisses other people that may be like inclined to think
*  that maybe it's good to be kinder be good to be more open and then they hear those fucks and they're
*  like fuck these people i'm gonna vote for trump again yeah and that's what happens i i i hear that
*  i definitely hear that i hear that because that's what um that's how i would i would say it like
*  for me it was more or less just awareness of of myself and i didn't really i was aware of myself
*  but i didn't really have the awareness like i didn't like how do i it's it's almost to the
*  point where i'm just more cognizant of every single choice that i make you know and and and just um
*  and that's something i really didn't didn't care about or really didn't think about before
*  you know and just that awareness right there it uh it brings a whole new different understanding
*  of life but i was i was like that person when i first woke i'm just like ah man why
*  ain't this person woke and i wanted to wake up everybody and it was it was the most frustrating
*  thing in the world and that's why i was like you know what i just i won't do it man isn't that what
*  always happens when people find something interesting like that's what happens when people
*  start doing crossfit it's happens when people start doing jiu-jitsu they just can't shut the
*  fuck up about it and it happens when people take on you know a new spiritual philosophy
*  yeah they they want everybody to understand how they're doing it and that you should do it this
*  way too when people believe in what they're doing they want to want to share it but they also want
*  other people to do it too because if i can convince you to live my way then it validates the way i'm
*  living right because look i got that's true shod's woke too now why don't you be woke right and then
*  you know and then you start just trying to spread it but i think that i mean everybody has their own
*  awakening you know and if some people may not have that in this life you know they may never
*  they may never have that that awakening but some people are burdened by their environment as well
*  right there's too much stress and anxiety and you can't even say yeah sometimes you don't have space
*  and that's why i even give a nod to the psychedelics in that respect when when if you
*  don't have the ability to have that mental space there is something that can help have you had that
*  you know the insight that somebody who was who was doing all the meditation because all you really
*  need to do is feel it to understand why you need to do it yes and and that's why i was i'm lucky
*  that i was able to feel it so now it's nothing for me to meditate and and go to all these you
*  know spiritual practice because i know that is something real but beforehand i was like man that
*  shit is not real i don't believe that man like oh yeah you feeling energy huh like i mean i used to
*  i used to be one of those guys but until i went through it i'm just like you know you don't have
*  that understanding well it's hard to see the result you kind of have to trust the process
*  it's hard to see the result before you've experienced it you kind of have to trust the
*  process go through it then something for me for me a big one is yoga i'm a big believer in yoga
*  and not just for physical reasons for mental reasons it helps me tremendously and when i
*  don't do it i'm good i'm good like legitimately i should do yoga twice a week because i'm really
*  only good for about three days after yoga class like i need to just really balance out if i was
*  doing it three times a week there's not a thing in the world that could fuck with me yeah and
*  mentally i'd be like i'm fine see i i i've done i've done the the bikram yoga and that shit was
*  just so hot i really couldn't i really couldn't focus that's the key though i know that's that's
*  what i wasn't where i wasn't where i am right now you should do it now so tell me so tell me like
*  like when you you go to bkram oh yeah yeah yeah yeah well my my place is not affiliated with
*  bkram anymore okay because he's uh yeah got arrested for some scumbaggery he's he's he's
*  actually been arrested and i don't think he could come to america i think that's the thing i think
*  he's kind of like staying hiding um the thing about it at that guru life that's the problem
*  that it is a problem it's really is a problem when any one person has that much influence over so
*  many people particularly a male having so much influence over females that worship him especially
*  if you're a scumbag and uh he he there's a thing about this he did not invent those postures and
*  he didn't even invent that sequence he brought it to america and he popularized doing it in in in
*  very hot rooms uh the benefits though forget him take him out of the equation because there's so
*  many people that practice it and they've had incredible benefits from it it's it's really
*  unfortunate that it's connected to this very controversial individual because then people
*  associate bikram yoga with this guy that's been you know accused of multiple sexual assaults and
*  rapes and all these different things but you take that away from him as a human being and the people
*  that practice it what they get from it first of all you know exactly what you're going to do
*  every day there's 26 postures and two breathing exercises one breathing exercise in the beginning
*  26 postures one breathing exercise at the end it's 90 minutes it's 90 minutes at 105 degrees
*  and it's fucking brutal and i did it right before i got here i do it uh i like to do it in the
*  mornings first thing in the morning i do it before i've eaten anything i go through a 90 minute yoga
*  class i really like doing it that way and then at the end of the day i have a couple different
*  places that i do it at i like to mix it up but that hot yoga for me is the way to go because
*  first of all it's i know the postures they all they all serve a purpose in terms of like helping
*  my body helping my balance keeping my flexibility strengthening my joints there's so many really
*  positive physical benefits from it and then two the meditation aspect of it because no matter what
*  kind of bullshit i have going on in my life if i just breathe and think about the exercise and then
*  you know my brain starts racing and i'll forget what i'm doing and i'll start thinking about other
*  shit but i bring it back bring it back bring it back breathe just breathe you're not going anywhere
*  for 90 minutes you're locked in this room literally the door is locked when the class starts so i am
*  just breathing and going through these and i know that i can get through it because i've done it a
*  thousand times before just breathe and get through it and there's a cleansing of like all the your
*  brain there's like residual there's residue of like shitty thoughts bouncing around inside your
*  brain anxieties and fears and regrets and anger and frustration and all this shit that's in your
*  head that just gets in the way of clear thinking it gets in the way of being able to see things in
*  an objective beneficial way and to be able to see things the way other people seem as well
*  like sometimes i you know i have this issue i think a lot of people do that i don't see how other
*  people are seeing things i see how i see i see things and then i go well okay well let me let
*  me look at it from their way let me just abandon oh no no well they're fucking wrong that's right
*  abandon all that shit and try to look at it from other people's ways i feel like
*  what yoga does for me is it allows me to be free it allows me to clean up all my
*  preconceived notions and clean out all my misconceptions and just see things
*  see things for how they are and i always feel better always see i gotta try that oh it's the
*  best especially now that you're on this uh vegan diet i'm telling you you're on that path anyway
*  yoga is it's just so good for straightening your fucking head out man i always wanted to try that
*  that kundalini yoga that's the shit that's supposed to make you trip yeah i've had a bunch of friends
*  do it they say my friend denny he's done it and had like serious and he's done dmt too he's like
*  dude it's the same goddamn thing you have full-blown visions you have full-blown psychedelic visions
*  yeah that's the thing like like when i like when i do like uh the dmt i don't have like i don't
*  have uh it's weird i don't have like those visions those visions okay that's because you're doing
*  five methoxy dimethyltryptamine the visions come from nn dimethyltryptamine yeah totally different
*  thing i've done both i've done that i've done that before that you've done nn yeah and you have
*  no visions um you know i i have visions it's kind of like uh it's just like silly things though
*  sometimes like i like i've seen like one time i did it i've seen like this half like it was like uh
*  i i i awake and i'm in a place and i'm just with uh these three massive beings like tall as a
*  building and they were like half human and they were half snake and i got a snake from the waist
*  down and that had a human from the waist up but had like a snake face oh yeah and that's that was
*  one of the visions that i had what do you think that represented i don't know but it was weird
*  because during that experience it was like they were all like i was all three of them were staring
*  at me and they were looking down and then one of them reached for me and then i started going up
*  and then i started going around their body and then i went around the body and then as i was
*  going around the body every once in a while i would see the face of of of it and it was like
*  open up like a cobra and then it would close but it wasn't scary it wasn't terrifying and i went
*  all the way up the body and it was like i was able to see from another angle like me up in the body
*  and then it like opened me up like a like a like a flower or something like that it was weird
*  and then my trip went like super super fast so you definitely have had visions yeah i just can't
*  can't quite make out like what it what's it supposed to be yeah what's it supposed to be i
*  had a bunch of jokers giving me the finger the last time a bunch of uh jesters like court
*  like that it was ridiculous they were all like fuck fuck fuck you all like like circling me
*  like infinite numbers of guys basically the feeling that i got was like oh i take myself
*  too seriously and these these jesters were just going fuck you like you don't like that you don't
*  like when someone goes fuck you know so they were going fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck you and it was
*  like but they weren't saying the words but they would definitely give me the finger but there was
*  like an infinite number of jesters surrounding me going like giving me like this vibrating finger
*  it was and i was like oh but it was clear what they were saying like hey bitch you take yourself
*  too seriously and then i was like okay you're right you're right and once i was saying you're
*  right they're like nod at me like okay okay see that's what i like i like to be able to work
*  like that's work yeah let's work right there like you went you went and you worked through something
*  yes yes i think when you work too hard at something and you're trying to achieve something
*  like oftentimes you think very highly of yourself like that's what you like i should you know my
*  netflix special is gonna be the shit i'm gonna this is gonna be the best one i've ever done i'm
*  gonna fucking show everybody how good this is and and they were like fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck you
*  and i was like okay all right yeah you're right i was like you're right this is silly that's like
*  i'm just alive for a certain amount of time and i shouldn't think that way i mean there's part of
*  you that gets trapped in thinking that way because you're trying to do something but you don't have
*  to think that way to do the thing right you know yeah so so that's the thing like um like those
*  visions and being able to like when i did ayahuasca i didn't have any visions man i didn't have
*  anything like i had i had a i got into a pretty uh pretty good space but i wasn't like i didn't
*  have like the typical teaching lessons everybody else has when they do something that seems like
*  you probably didn't get a strong enough dose no i know i did i did um i did three large two large
*  cups the thing is with that and i'm speaking just from people talking to me about it because i've
*  only done the pure dmt i haven't done the ayahuasca i haven't done ayahuasca people say that a lot of
*  these people that are making it they're not making either they're not making it correctly or they're
*  making a light dose because they're worried about gringos going crazy and you know and they don't
*  want to be responsible for that shit so i know people that have gone and they've had these
*  experiences where they've done it with someone in america or someone who's done through a more
*  commercial sort of organization and it wasn't really that strong or profound and then they
*  went and did it with someone who was real someone who's making some fucking super high-grade
*  you know 97 octane shit and that's what i mean oh fuck that's what i mean because i feel i feel
*  like after that i felt like like damn i must be i must be broke man i'm like like i'm like i must
*  be i must be i must be broken like i can't like i can't even feel the the damn ayahuasca but it
*  it was it brought like it didn't it didn't give me the experience i i wanted but it gave me the
*  experience that i needed you know and that's and that's something that i i got after i was like
*  over the disappointment of it i'm just like you know what i didn't get what i wanted but
*  i definitely got what i needed you know because whenever you sit in a circle and stuff like that
*  it's always an amazing cathartic thing where you just kind of just like shed and just go through
*  those emotions uh just watching other people just be so raw with their emotions and just kind of
*  feeling that you know just just through symbiosis you kind of like start to feel like the work come
*  through you you know that's that's how i felt anyways now are you working a lot with fighters
*  now are you working with young fighters are you doing in any official capacity or you just doing
*  it because you're at the gym um i i just do i just train because i'm at the gym but i like to uh i
*  like to train with the guys when i'm in there because i go i go uh i can go at a good pace and
*  i don't i don't mind if they they hit me up a little bit you know and i and i will give them
*  a look at some of some of the training partners you know won't give them uh so yeah i i enjoy
*  that aspect of it but i haven't been like oh you know i'm gonna i'm gonna come in here i haven't
*  dedicated myself to someone's full camp you know one of the reasons why i say this is a lot of
*  people that i talk to that have trained with you and work with you one of the things they really
*  like about you is your guidance is that you're a guy that they could sit down and talk to about
*  things and you have a very learned and wise perspective and that that could be especially
*  with you know you consider your successful career that could be like very beneficial for young
*  fighters coming up and i just wanted to know like had you ever thought about becoming a trainer
*  yeah i think about all the time and i and i've um i work with some fighters now like i have um this
*  team out of michigan uh is mercy the team mercy lago that oh my old coach wakim barriguez he's
*  like the head guy there but him and i work together we try to bring some of the fighters out
*  and try to get them to like the bigger shows and stuff like that but those fighters you know i work
*  with a lot you know my godson uh is one of those fighters there devin smith you know and i work
*  with him and trying to get him to just you know not only fight at a certain level but mentally
*  bring himself to a certain level you know and you know he's always hated because he's always like
*  man you always try to be like like like yoda try to give me a yoda lesson i'm like no i'm not
*  trying to be yoda i'm just trying to i just want to tell you you know i hope you like it yeah
*  because because one time he hit me up he was like uh he's like oh man i'm ready to come down i'm
*  ready to train i'm like okay you ready to come and train i'm like all right so have you been
*  training and he's like no and i'm like hmm and i'm like so what makes you think is going to be
*  different if you come and train with me i mean you still have to train and he's like i better
*  get to the gym huh that's one of the weirdest conversations i've ever had with people that go
*  you know what man if i train i think i'll be a fucking world champion like okay i don't even
*  know where to start with that right i don't even know what to say there okay if i meditate i think
*  i can see through walls i'm not going to meditate though like what does that mean that is i know
*  people have weird ways of looking at themselves you know where they just decide they're special
*  without putting in any work you know like they decide there's something about them that makes
*  them different yeah and they want that to be the case but they don't want to work towards it it's
*  a weird trap that you see in young people where they just convince themselves there's something
*  significant about them you know and that's a real problem with young guys they get into fighting
*  that have a delusional perspective and they'll accept fights they shouldn't accept yeah so like
*  i'll fight that motherfucker that guy has 30 fights you have won are you crazy you know but that i
*  think that i see that more with with the kids and it's this next generation just because we're such
*  a voyeuristic community i mean society now and i think now people just see somebody like oh yeah
*  i can do that but not really realizing like you said all the the guts that go into what make them
*  good at what they do well there's there's lessons that are out there if you just pay attention look
*  here's a great lesson conor mcgregor versus floyd mayweather one guy has zero pro boxing matches one
*  guy's the greatest of all time yeah and somehow another they sold us on this thing and we all
*  paid money me included and we watched this fight that was exactly how any expert would tell you
*  it's gonna go down floyd's gonna fuck him up there's another one maybe even more egregious
*  one because at least conor mcgregor was a world champ and combat sports athlete and a wicked
*  fighter right there was a lion fight uh where they had lurdzilla do you know who lurdzilla is
*  he's a motherfucker this thai dude he's a motherfucker and he fought this dude with zero
*  pro muay thai fights i think lurdzilla has 300 muay thai fights and he fought this dude and played
*  with him and then head kicked him into another dimension but he head kicked him off the front
*  leg just what just and the dude folded it's a crazy it's a crazy case set up like that i don't
*  know i think maybe he had another opponent and that opponent got injured and dropped out then
*  this mma fighter decided to try his hand at muay thai so he jumped in there in a muay thai fight
*  against arguably one of the greatest muay thai fighters alive you should watch lurdzilla's
*  highlight reel first of all he's super elusive he's an unusually elusive fighter but he hit this
*  motherfucker with a left high kick just off the front leg just whipped it up off the front leg
*  and caught him on the chin folding him and i was like that whoever said yes to that fight whatever
*  commission allowed that fight to take place you guys should have to go to trial like someone should
*  someone should sit down with you and go how the fuck did you allow this to take place that's sad
*  that sounds crazy as hell zero pro fights versus 300 i mean maybe he didn't have 300 maybe at 264
*  or some crazy shit like that but he's lurdzilla i mean lurdzilla is a famous muay thai fighter
*  oh did you find it yeah here it is oh that's the dude after he got crumpled but you go go before
*  that go before that so you could watch i mean lurdzilla is just fucking him up from the beginning
*  and credit to the dude for thinking he could take the fight and step it up but it lurdzilla
*  basically just battered this fucking guy you can tell the look on his face he's just playing with
*  him yes well lurdzilla is brilliant man look at that look at that and that was one knockdown
*  he got up after that yeah he knocked him out after that he knocked him out watch his front leg teep
*  watch it smack oh my god folds him that's a complete total mismatch like if that dude was
*  doing that and sparring to that guy everyone would be mad at him everybody would be like hey
*  man this guy's not on your level don't fuck him up yeah like take it light on him be nice
*  look at this teep smack oh my god hands down not worried about shit playing with him and the whole
*  fight's like that though and lurdzilla is a beast man he's fun to watch he's that damn kick was
*  lightning lightning fast wow off the tee and then no wind up no switch just cracks him in the face
*  dude that's crazy that guy's brilliant but that's a crazy mismatch so a guy could say i'll fucking
*  fight this guy someone needs to grab you and go hey man no no don't do it you think you can hit
*  the bag you think you can hit hard you think you can do all these things you're about to get in
*  there with a master a guy who has mastered this one particularly brutal combat sport don't do that
*  it's nothing worse than when you're in a match when you feel that damn outmatched by somebody
*  i was uh i was doing jujitsu and i think i was going with a hodger gracey and i always felt like
*  i was doing pretty i was like i feel like i'm i'm pretty all right and then when i went with him he
*  was just on me and i and it was just like just toying with me you know what i'm saying like i
*  felt like i couldn't make a right move and i'm just like man this sucks this is the worst it's
*  the worst then he got on top of me and normally if i get on somebody like i can hold them down
*  pretty well but it was just a different level and i'm just like wow yeah those old school guys like
*  hodger gracey sal hobera jandre shandi uh who hiberro those guys have that pressure top game
*  there's something about that old school jujitsu pressure game you know but salo is a master at
*  that you know shanji's a master at that rafael lavato's a master at that that's smashing pressure
*  game but hodger is not just a master that he's also like his physical attributes he's so long
*  and tall yeah that that longness and he knows he's smush he's got he's got uh like you know
*  that long leverage that tall strength oh yeah oh man that's a different kind of strength
*  somebody long and tall and strong oh my gosh well that's a big advantage john has yes you see john
*  use that on people yeah that long strength is the best grappling strength it's like those those guys
*  that have that i feel like that body that john jones body is a perfect body for mma because he's
*  strong he's tall he's tall and thin but he's also strong as fuck like he's muscled enough but he
*  also has that extra length yeah and his legs are perfect too they're skinny at the end you go down
*  and get really skinny so they're really fast too yeah i'm just watching him throw kicks i'm like
*  man he's throwing those legs like it's effortless you know his calves are ridiculous they don't even
*  make sense like how are those on your body right how are those on your body you look at his
*  shoulders his shoulders are massive they go down those little calves like what's going on here
*  and he kicks the hell out of you with those little skinny legs too crazy and there hasn't been many
*  people that have been able to exploit the fact those calves are so small they haven't really
*  you would think that like with everybody this trend in calf kicks tiago santos tried it he hit
*  him with some good ones for sure but john figures it out eventually and then he just starts checking
*  them he checked most of them against dominic most of those low calf kicks he checked them how do you
*  just saw them coming well how do you even check a lower leg kick because that's that's turned
*  turned out you know turned out um he just made it so that he was going shin to shin they went
*  shin to shin a lot yeah i've seen that it's real hard to check though and it's really hard to check
*  it's also real hard to just take you could take those thigh kicks if you're conditioned
*  well a little bit and just and just like you said like he had to make a choice to take it how he
*  wanted it but he's still taking the shot right he's still going shin to shin yeah he's still going
*  shin to shin but they're both feeling it that's the difference they're both feeling it when you
*  get when you get the meaty part of that bone part that's when you get that sciatic nerve and that's
*  that's when you you you shut down like chandler did that he had no choice his leg was like nope
*  not today too in the second fight with mighty mouse his legs shut down yeah your nerve just
*  shuts off your foot doesn't work it's numb it's just dangling yeah try to stand on it
*  it just collapses the chandler fight they were trying to tell him his legs broken and he's like
*  i'm fucking fine leave me alone you know and i i think that fight should not have been stopped i
*  think if you got to give but the referee should know and the doctor should know this is what
*  happens if you just give it a few minutes to recover if he can survive the onslaught during
*  that time his leg will come back and i think in chandler probably would have and sahudo it did
*  sahudo figured out how to just sort of chuck and jive with mighty mouse and i don't think mighty
*  mouse knew the extent that his leg was numb but it but it recovered when you get hit like that though
*  for a second you're like this motherfucker's cheating like you feel like you feel it for a second you
*  feel like this motherfucker's cheating because it hurts so badly and it's very rare to have something
*  that hurts you immediately in mma like there's there's not many strikes that can hurt you
*  immediately right that's that's one of them that hurts you that nerve pain you feel it immediately
*  isn't it weird that that went on forever until benson henderson started doing it to people
*  yeah he was the first in mma in my opinion at a high level to start chopping at those lower legs
*  real low real low like right above the ankle we fuck people up with that you will kill people
*  with those and but now that is like that is the move everybody's doing it now it's a staple it's
*  funny how mma does it though it goes to all these cycles now yeah and i think now people are really
*  starting to find a home for those uh those oblique kicks that john does you know yes
*  the winkle john camp they're weird though because if you graze off it leaves you in a weird place
*  because you you're kind of your foot's turned outward and you can get hit with punches you're
*  in a weird punching range where you're not in a good stance to fire back right because your
*  foot is sort of pronated outside outside it's um it's a great kick though you know who fucking
*  throws the shit out of that lorenz larkin oh yeah he throws that shit to the body when he fought
*  neil magny he threw that oblique kick to the body and i was like oh my goodness that motherfucking
*  kick though he's good he can kick when he when i'm watching him kick i'm just like oh my gosh
*  yeah he's so fast too oh my god yeah he i was really interested to see how he was gonna do
*  over in bellator you know but then he had that crazy war with paul daily you can't get in a
*  war with paul daily no that dude's left hand is one of the best weapons in the sport period
*  he got that one hitter he got that heat he has that left hand's ridiculous it's crazy right it's
*  crazy it's stupid it's stupid just to have that power in his hands there's certain guys that just
*  have that like rumble oh my rumble and now he's gonna come back as a heavyweight he said yeah and
*  he's looking good he's in training he's in training now and rumble versus dominic reyes how about that
*  how about that that would be how about that rumble scares the fuck out of everybody
*  like you might beat him but you also might get knocked into another dimension because he he
*  hits what he hits like like i've like when i mean he's been my training partner for the longest time
*  and he knows like i'm like rumble you know don't don't hurt me yeah don't be going crazy man
*  oh it's like i go girl you know i go crazy i go crazy and we train we train smart but
*  i mean there's a couple times he hit me i'm like man i'm not your friend anymore
*  fucking talk to me don't you fucking talk to me i told you don't hit me like that dude when he
*  knocked out glover with one punch i was like holy shit you do that to glover to shara i know
*  that's crazy and the thing about his punches is like you can't really gauge how like you don't
*  know which one is going to be that shot because they kind of yeah they come at he likes to moves
*  his hands around a lot too yeah so you don't know which one's going to be the one that touch you
*  yeah and they come from all angles here he is in shape now he's been training with hoofed he looks
*  good he looks gigantic it's so hard to believe that guy was ever 170 i am so baffled by how the
*  fuck he made that weight so this is over at uh the new gym stanford look at him man just so what is
*  the new gym called it's called it's called stanford the team is called stanford mma now okay and who's
*  uh who's running that it's the same same people it's it's henry henry hoof sanford yeah sanford
*  no t sanford mma yeah and so it's all the black zillion guys yep all the black zillion guys look
*  at that rory and uh robbie law are training together there now yeah rory's rory's been there
*  getting some work in the last couple weeks how long has this gym been around for uh man so this
*  is h kickboxing oh okay it just has a different name yeah just different name so we just now moved
*  into that gym on a more consistent basis it looks beautiful yeah i mean they spent i think like a
*  couple million on it they they spent some money on that gym and this is in the same place as uh
*  the where the black zillions was the same area same area yeah yeah so we had we had the black
*  zillion gym and then we went to a gym uh that's that was at this um this like amusement park for
*  kids it was like it's called extreme action park and that's what we had a section that we we had
*  there and then they also added this gym too so now they're gonna have they're gonna keep that gym
*  at extreme action park but also keep this one south florida man what a hotbed for martial arts
*  right it really is so much jiu-jitsu down there oh man you can yeah you got cyborg right down the
*  street and cyborg is is amazing and you know mario spary not too far down what happened with mario
*  because mario was the head coach for a while of the black zillions right and he was inspirational as
*  fuck oh mario was give those speeches and i was like oh i get goosebumps yeah mario was the best
*  i just think that him and um him and glenn didn't didn't work out when it came time to it and all
*  the work in chemistry together you know because that that was that was the hardest thing because
*  you know having all those different coaches and trying to not only have them get along with the
*  fighters but then have them get along with each other and not try to fight for that you know who's
*  the main coach and who's the main guy you know and that's you know coaches sometimes are bigger
*  eagles than the fighters right and um sometimes more deadly because they they they're they're
*  not accomplished and a lot of times they're they're coaching because they don't feel that
*  accomplishment you know so then coaching becomes that thing that they they want to be validated for
*  right right right and um you know but it's so hard to find that balance and the ones who find it
*  they're so cherished the guys like mark henry the guys like trevor whitman you know i mean those
*  those faraz sahabi duke rufus those coaches that are like legit coaches that everybody loves man
*  they're so cherished they are so valuable because also for a fighter like trevor whitman's holding
*  pads for you like holy fuck i'm training with trevor motherfucking whitman yeah you know what
*  i mean there's something to that if you go to montreal and you're in faraz sahabi's gym you're
*  like holy shit that is faraz sahabi talking to me absolutely there's some power to that and you
*  start to believe it you start to believe anything they're saying if he tells you you're good you're
*  good outstanding excellent you know for us you're like oh shit for us just said that yeah yeah it's
*  crazy man to see like where these like for us i remember when he wasn't even a coach he was just
*  a fighter like when i like when i first started going to montreal he wasn't the coach yet he was
*  uh really still he was still fighting yeah wow he's still fighting he's such a good coach he is
*  phenomenal he's such a genius person when you talk to him perspective on things he's so
*  he's always recommending books and shit he's always recommending listen to this guy because
*  this guy has that like he told me about a competitive shooter what is that guy's name
*  lammy lammy the the guy who wrote that the winning mindset anyway he wrote lammy i wrote it down
*  somewhere i have the book at home that i've been reading lately where the fuck is it god damn it
*  can't remember but anyway point is he's always recommending me shit he's always got something
*  something interesting that he's been paying attention to that he can relate to mma and to
*  fighting and he's he's very very keenly aware of the mental battles that are going on and how much
*  visualization is important and meditating lamby bassam lamby bassam yeah guy was a competitive
*  target shooter and he spent more time practicing in his head than he did practicing
*  more time visualizing that works that really does work does something because when i was like i said
*  when i was hurt for the rampage fight like in training camp i would i would visualize a lot
*  how would you do it i would just sit there and i would just kind of like uh i would go through
*  moves in my mind and i'll go through techniques and i would just kind of go over and over again
*  the techniques in my mind i'll also do scenarios where i fight in almost every single situation
*  like i find myself you know losing and then finding a way to come back after i've been rocked
*  you know and just trying to find myself just mentally working through it mentally working
*  a lot through it almost every single fight like i'll go round by round really yeah i'll go round
*  by round and i'll just like okay i'll set up the scenario okay i'll come out and i catch him with
*  a punch and then i'm just imagining what happens after that and then i put myself in adversity
*  adversity adversity every single time i can as much as i can so then that way i find myself always
*  you know i get myself out of adversity sometimes i just find myself just smoking them but it's
*  always these different mental mental games and me just doing something to executing and always
*  just doing it right so it's almost like you were fighting without having to fight yeah you were
*  getting the experience of fighting in your head by just visualizing it would you set a certain
*  amount of time that you would do it um no i would just i would just i would just go with the flow
*  you know i had um my wrestling coach in college tom minkle he was always he was always on uh like
*  i was i was like i get nervous i get nervous i don't know what to do with the nervousness and
*  he says well he says you're nervous because you're thinking too much about about about it he said
*  just just think about executing don't think about the outcome just think about executing your
*  technique and just only think about executing your technique and how it feels to complete the
*  perfect execution of the technique when you hit the pad and it hits that and it sounds that you
*  know they hear that pop you know how does that feel you know become attached to how you feel
*  when you execute something and then that's what you start to base your fight off of you know how
*  you feel when you execute versus all the things that can happen if something goes wrong
*  hmm yeah it's it's really interesting to see the different strategies that people employ in order
*  to like focus the mind you know so many different fighters have different ways of doing it some
*  fighters like to meditate some fighters like to shadow box their way through scenarios almost like
*  they they they're thinking about how the fight's going to go down while they're like slow motion
*  doing things you know i would i would get in a mirror sometimes i'll yell in the mirror i'll like
*  yell out the fear like come on like i would i would i would just you know i would i would get
*  into it because a lot of times i would get so nervous that i would be like oh my god i just
*  don't want to freeze out there i just don't want to freeze you know so i would like that's that's
*  part of the reason why i started twisting my nipples like i go out there and i'll twist my
*  nipples before the fight and that was just to kind of do something stupid and silly right but then it
*  would allow me to just kind of relax because i'm like well i'm not gonna embarrass myself any worse
*  than that that's funny i always i remember always wanting to ask you about that yeah why do you guys
*  do that i was just doing just like you know i'm not embarrassed myself worse than that so did george
*  used to do that shit too george would do it yeah george george would do it because you know he
*  i don't know i think he he didn't like the way his nipples look when he first came out the shirt
*  yeah
*  that's funny some people don't like puffy nipples man pull out of and yank out of the shit
*  yeah nipples on guys are weird things anyway i know you know it looks even worse yeah well some dudes
*  have like big areolas yeah they're real embarrassed they don't want to take their shirt off you don't
*  want to take your shirt off with a big areola well girl it doesn't matter at all but a guy
*  with a big areola is like whoa what's happening here what's going on there the titty just hanging
*  out like that weird it's pornographic it's pornographic that's what it is that's for dudes
*  when they get fat that's a bummer man when they develop man tits i know that's a bummer and when
*  they don't care they can slap you with them and stuff like that too that's terrible that's terrible
*  that's terrible oh my gosh i'm just glad i didn't have nothing like that i did get big big to have
*  some booby weight but not that dang big what do you do most of the time now like what is your days
*  what do you occupy your days with um you know i know you're doing a lot of analyst work
*  yeah so i still do uh you know i still do the analyst work but i also you know
*  try to do as much as i can with onyx and i still do my training and things like that but
*  you know i also um also work with cbs a little bit uh you know doing analyst analyst stuff for
*  them but you know i'm still i'm still in that space just trying to figure out that next thing
*  that that that i align with you know and that's why i'm so excited to work with unlimited sciences
