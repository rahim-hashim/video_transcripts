*  Hi Ruff Ruff. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=14.0s)]
*  I'm so excited to be here with you today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=19.0s)]
*  This is our first podcast coming out as our true selves. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=20.0s)]
*  We're furries! [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=23.0s)]
*  Yeah, we've been holding it in forever. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=25.0s)]
*  This is my true identity. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=27.0s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=29.0s)]
*  It just eats me alive to not tell how we met at a furry con. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=31.0s)]
*  Well, we didn't know that we met there. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=35.0s)]
*  Remember? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=40.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, I didn't know who you were for a long time. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=41.0s)]
*  Yeah, we didn't know. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=43.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh my god, you're Meow Meow? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=44.0s)]
*  Dude, it blew my mind. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=46.0s)]
*  I mean, to me, that is proof we're in a simulation. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=49.0s)]
*  Because what are the odds? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=52.0s)]
*  They're not good. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=54.0s)]
*  What are the odds, man? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=56.0s)]
*  The odds are also not good that I'm going to keep this fucking helmet on. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=58.0s)]
*  Oh my god, I'm sweating. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=61.0s)]
*  This is not good for me. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=63.0s)]
*  I'm not keeping this on. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=64.0s)]
*  I can barely breathe. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=65.0s)]
*  How do they do it? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=67.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=68.0s)]
*  They fuck with these things on. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=69.0s)]
*  How do you fuck with this on? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=70.0s)]
*  They're heroes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=72.0s)]
*  Total respect. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=73.0s)]
*  Total respect for furries now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=75.0s)]
*  Respect for the furry community. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=77.0s)]
*  Look, I've got the feet on and everything. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=79.0s)]
*  It's like Beakrum fucking. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=81.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=83.0s)]
*  It's very hot in here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=84.0s)]
*  If you can fuck with this on, you're an American hero. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=85.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=88.0s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=89.0s)]
*  David Coggins needs to put on one of these things and fuck for an hour. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=91.0s)]
*  He should. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=95.0s)]
*  Yeah, you think you're so cool running for 1,000 miles? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=96.0s)]
*  How about fuck for four and a half minutes with this on? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=99.0s)]
*  I can't fuck for four and a half minutes without it on. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=103.0s)]
*  This is like sprinting uphill. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=106.0s)]
*  This is really brutal. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=108.0s)]
*  And just thinking about padding around a Ramada in one of these things. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=111.0s)]
*  But I get it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=116.0s)]
*  Orlando outside during the summer. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=118.0s)]
*  I get it when I put it on. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=120.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=122.0s)]
*  I know why they do it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=123.0s)]
*  I don't know why all of them do it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=124.0s)]
*  Wait, why? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=126.0s)]
*  Why do you think they do it? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=127.0s)]
*  I think they do it because it offers you an anonymity that is impossible any other way. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=128.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=134.0s)]
*  And it turns you into your image, the visual that people get of you, is this adorable, cute mascot. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=135.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=144.0s)]
*  Everybody loves a mascot. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=145.0s)]
*  The mascot is literally there to pump everybody up and yay! [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=146.0s)]
*  And they don't talk and everybody loves them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=149.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=151.0s)]
*  And people at Disneyland, same thing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=152.0s)]
*  Wait, they don't talk? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=154.0s)]
*  No! [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=155.0s)]
*  They don't talk. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=156.0s)]
*  Like if you meet Goofy, Goofy doesn't say jack shit to you. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=157.0s)]
*  We went to Goofy's kitchen. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=162.0s)]
*  Goofy doesn't talk. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=163.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I can't do it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=164.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=167.0s)]
*  It's so hard to breathe. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=169.0s)]
*  It's so hard to breathe. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=171.0s)]
*  Horrible. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=173.0s)]
*  How about those fucking people that work at Disneyland? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=174.0s)]
*  They wear these things and they walk around in the heat in the summer? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=176.0s)]
*  Respect to them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=179.0s)]
*  Dude, those Disneyland, like the people who do this at Disneyland, they party. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=181.0s)]
*  I bet they. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=186.0s)]
*  I heard it's like insane when they get off work. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=187.0s)]
*  Like they fucking party. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=189.0s)]
*  First of all, it's not even their fault. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=191.0s)]
*  Their brains have been cooked all day. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=192.0s)]
*  Do you know what kind of effect that must have on their cognitive function? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=194.0s)]
*  Dude, like while we're bitching because they made us wear masks on planes, they're going around in a hot box. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=197.0s)]
*  I bet they made them wear a mask under their stupid mask. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=203.0s)]
*  Guarantee it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=206.0s)]
*  I bet they did. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=207.0s)]
*  Guarantee it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=209.0s)]
*  I bet they did. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=210.0s)]
*  Those fucking dorks. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=211.0s)]
*  You had a mask up in your Goofy outfit. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=212.0s)]
*  I got good outfits though. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=216.0s)]
*  These are dope. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=218.0s)]
*  Dude, these are incredible and it's kind of sad that... [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=219.0s)]
*  We can't. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=222.0s)]
*  We're pussies. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=223.0s)]
*  Of all the costumes we've worn, I think this is the least time we've spent. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=224.0s)]
*  Even the hoods. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=232.0s)]
*  But I was almost like hyperventilating in there. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=234.0s)]
*  Dude, I was panicking. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=236.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, you can see this awful wall. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=238.0s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=246.0s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=248.0s)]
*  Don't you get it though? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=249.0s)]
*  If you were a very tortured, socially awkward person, your life has just been a mess, but you are for whatever reason attracted sexually to the idea of it, or maybe not even sexually, maybe just attracted to the idea of it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=251.0s)]
*  But then you do it and you get to be not just innocuous, not just like someone that gets picked on, not that, but instead attractive. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=266.0s)]
*  You're this adorable thing. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=277.0s)]
*  You're adorable. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=278.0s)]
*  Like, hey. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=279.0s)]
*  And people want, they come up to you with a different energy. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=280.0s)]
*  Dude, I've seen some really hot furry porn. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=282.0s)]
*  Like, I've seen some incredible furry porn. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=285.0s)]
*  What's the worst furry porn? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=288.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen something like, God, you guys aren't even trying? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=289.0s)]
*  Those are still shots, usually, like weird Polaroids and stuff. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=291.0s)]
*  And generally those are like solo furries who are banging a stuffed animal. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=296.0s)]
*  Like, you know. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=302.0s)]
*  That sucks. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=303.0s)]
*  That sucks. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=306.0s)]
*  That's not cool. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=307.0s)]
*  That's not cool. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=308.0s)]
*  What do they do? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=309.0s)]
*  Like put a flashlight in a stuffed animal? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=310.0s)]
*  No, they're not that advanced. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=311.0s)]
*  They just rip a hole in the fourth in the fucking thing's butt and just like leave their crusted jizz on it as some mark of achievement or something. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=313.0s)]
*  Really bad. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=322.0s)]
*  Really bad. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=323.0s)]
*  Human beings are so weird in so many ways. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=324.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=329.0s)]
*  In so many ways. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=330.0s)]
*  But it's so funny. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=331.0s)]
*  It's like media, like Norman Rockwell paintings. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=333.0s)]
*  There's just like image of us that we are when we're at our best. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=337.0s)]
*  The family dinner table in a 1980s movie. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=342.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=344.0s)]
*  That's us when we're at our best. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=345.0s)]
*  Everyone's getting along. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=347.0s)]
*  How's school going? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=348.0s)]
*  Junior? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=349.0s)]
*  Junior's doing great. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=350.0s)]
*  But the reality is like there's no license to get a person. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=351.0s)]
*  You don't have a license to become pregnant. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=355.0s)]
*  You don't have to go through any qualification process. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=359.0s)]
*  It's literally the most important thing for the future of the human race. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=362.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=367.0s)]
*  That people who have children and raise those children are capable of doing it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=368.0s)]
*  You're capable of raising a well adjusted person. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=375.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=379.0s)]
*  Like any person growing up as a human being today, baby to grown up. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=380.0s)]
*  Like you're born today and you got to become a grown up in this fucking wacky world. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=385.0s)]
*  Good luck being normal. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=391.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=394.0s)]
*  This is having kids right now and like just having like a vague understanding of Kurzweil's predictions for the singularity. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=395.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=405.0s)]
*  And just like considering like, you know, with my kid, I will tell him like with the car, I'm like, you know, probably when you're old enough to drive. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=406.0s)]
*  They won't have steering wheels anymore. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=414.0s)]
*  You're probably not going to be driving the way I do because definitely don't you think like by if they can just prove see this this meatheads like me that I'd be like, fuck that bro. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=416.0s)]
*  I want to drive my own fucking car. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=427.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=429.0s)]
*  But if they can eliminate all deaths, you're going to have to take cars like that to attract. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=430.0s)]
*  You're going to have to do. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=436.0s)]
*  You're going to have to take the cars that I enjoy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=437.0s)]
*  You're going to take them to attract and drive around. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=439.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=441.0s)]
*  They're going to be rides. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=442.0s)]
*  It's not going to be your transportation. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=443.0s)]
*  You don't think in 10 years that it's going to be. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=445.0s)]
*  It's very possible. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=448.0s)]
*  Very possible. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=449.0s)]
*  It'll be it'll be a civil like a rule fight. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=450.0s)]
*  Like there'll be some dispute about whether or not people accept that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=454.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=459.0s)]
*  It's going to be a freedom issue with a lot of folks. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=460.0s)]
*  It is a freedom issue. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=462.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=463.0s)]
*  Well, it certainly is if you have a totalitarian government because there's only one way that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=464.0s)]
*  a car can drive itself autonomously. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=469.0s)]
*  It has to be connected to like insane technology that allows all sorts of things like like [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=472.0s)]
*  what a Tesla does. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=479.0s)]
*  Like you get updates online on your Tesla. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=480.0s)]
*  They just send you an update. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=483.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=484.0s)]
*  They fix things. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=485.0s)]
*  They make things better. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=486.0s)]
*  They make the auto driving feature better. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=487.0s)]
*  If that's the case, like if somebody just decides to shut your car off, you're not allowed [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=490.0s)]
*  to drive, Duncan. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=495.0s)]
*  We don't like your views on COVID vaccines. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=496.0s)]
*  No. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=498.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=499.0s)]
*  Sorry, your tweets. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=500.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=501.0s)]
*  I don't like the way you think about the world and life and love. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=502.0s)]
*  You're confusing people. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=504.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=505.0s)]
*  You didn't jog today. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=506.0s)]
*  You don't think exactly the way I want you to think. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=507.0s)]
*  So we're going to steer you and everybody who's paying attention in the same direction. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=509.0s)]
*  And the everybody's paying attention part is huge because there's more self-policing [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=514.0s)]
*  than there is policing. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=518.0s)]
*  There's more people that get scared of not going along with narratives than there are [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=519.0s)]
*  people enforcing them. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=523.0s)]
*  You know what that's called? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=524.0s)]
*  Cops in the head. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=525.0s)]
*  That's a name for it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=526.0s)]
*  Cops in the head. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=528.0s)]
*  It's like this is when I was in college. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=529.0s)]
*  I don't remember who came up with it, but basically they're studying neighborhoods [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=531.0s)]
*  that had huge police presences, you know, like bad areas, like hyper low income areas [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=537.0s)]
*  that like just like that, you could do the math. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=546.0s)]
*  And like, so basically the cops realized like they didn't have to patrol anymore after a [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=551.0s)]
*  certain amount of time because people assimilate the police state inside of them. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=556.0s)]
*  And just like you're saying, now you're policing yourself. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=562.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=565.0s)]
*  And that is the ultimate when you think about like trying to save money, when you think [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=566.0s)]
*  about controlling populations or when you think about like, you know, the huge problem [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=570.0s)]
*  of of like empire is like once you spread out too far, it's incredibly expensive to [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=574.0s)]
*  keep everything supplied and everything in control and to keep your like commanders doing [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=581.0s)]
*  what you say. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=587.0s)]
*  And so, you know, the best thing for an empire is for people to not even know that they're [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=588.0s)]
*  there, but to be like following the general prescription of the emperor. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=593.0s)]
*  You know, you know, that's the ultimate empire. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=598.0s)]
*  You know, don't put up statues of yourself. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=601.0s)]
*  Don't like put your fucking face on the coin. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=604.0s)]
*  What you want to do is get your philosophy into the brain of the people that you have. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=607.0s)]
*  I think the problem today is that there's there's so many more interesting narratives [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=612.0s)]
*  than the official narrative. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=618.0s)]
*  There's it used to be that you had a president that would stand up and talk to people and [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=620.0s)]
*  you know, he would give these speeches that everyone would listen to. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=627.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=630.0s)]
*  And that's Eisenhower at the end of his terms when he's saying he's warning America about [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=631.0s)]
*  the military industrial complex. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=637.0s)]
*  So there's a machine he's warning us, you know, that there's a machine that wants to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=639.0s)]
*  go to war. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=643.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=644.0s)]
*  And you have to be very careful that he's warning us about that. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=645.0s)]
*  And this is like you could tell the next president to not ever say that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=648.0s)]
*  And everybody else sort of steps in line. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=654.0s)]
*  So you tell the next president, don't talk about that. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=656.0s)]
*  You talk about the conflicts overseas. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=659.0s)]
*  You talk about the desire to spread democracy. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=661.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=664.0s)]
*  And you talk about these people that are a threat to everyone because they have weapons [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=665.0s)]
*  of mass destruction. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=668.0s)]
*  Like you got to follow a very, very, very specific narrative. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=669.0s)]
*  And that's all we had forever. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=673.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=675.0s)]
*  Forever. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=676.0s)]
*  And so there was all these people that would have cocktail parties and they would meet [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=677.0s)]
*  at coffee shops and then go, do you know what's really going on? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=679.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=682.0s)]
*  Because this is what I think. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=683.0s)]
*  I think the CIA is giving people LSD. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=684.0s)]
*  Like what? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=687.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=688.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=689.0s)]
*  You know those meetings where people in South Central were like, I think the government's [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=690.0s)]
*  bringing drugs in here. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=695.0s)]
*  And everybody's like, no fucking way. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=696.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=698.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=699.0s)]
*  They wouldn't do that. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=700.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=701.0s)]
*  They wouldn't do that. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=702.0s)]
*  But if you were, I mean, look, let's pretend you're a really good guy and you're a government [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=703.0s)]
*  agent. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=708.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=709.0s)]
*  You're the best. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=710.0s)]
*  You want nothing but freedom in America and spread democracy around the globe. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=711.0s)]
*  Congress won't approve funding some rebels. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=714.0s)]
*  And there's only one way. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=719.0s)]
*  You've got to get this guy out of office. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=721.0s)]
*  This guy's not playing ball. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=723.0s)]
*  He's not with the agenda. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=724.0s)]
*  He's a terrible dictator. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=725.0s)]
*  You've got to get rid of him. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=727.0s)]
*  And we need to fund this. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=729.0s)]
*  We need to fund these rebels. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=730.0s)]
*  So we're just going to sell some drugs. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=731.0s)]
*  So crazy. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=733.0s)]
*  But if you think about the fact that if you're in the DEA or if you're in the CIA or the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=734.0s)]
*  FBI or any major intel organization, they know the futility of the amount of drugs that [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=741.0s)]
*  are being brought into this country. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=749.0s)]
*  And there's a reason why. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=751.0s)]
*  Because there's a demand in this country. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=752.0s)]
*  You're not going to change it. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=754.0s)]
*  You're not going to change it. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=755.0s)]
*  And you see all these fucking scumbags making billions. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=756.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=759.0s)]
*  And you're like, well, why don't I make some fucking money? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=760.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=762.0s)]
*  Why don't we make some fucking money and do some good with it? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=763.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=766.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=767.0s)]
*  That's the Oliver North story. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=768.0s)]
*  Dude, here's the perfect business model. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=769.0s)]
*  You create a situation where you are selling drugs to people and then arresting them and [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=772.0s)]
*  taking your drugs back, plus all their stuff, and then reselling the drugs, rinse and repeat. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=779.0s)]
*  And you know who to arrest because you're selling them to them. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=787.0s)]
*  You're selling it to the mutants. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=789.0s)]
*  Call your friend. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=790.0s)]
*  And you just keep, it's basically like throwing out fishing nets, man. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=792.0s)]
*  Just throw out the nets, let them sell the drugs long enough to get a shit ton of money, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=797.0s)]
*  some nice cars, pull the nets back in. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=802.0s)]
*  You got the drugs. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=804.0s)]
*  You got the cars. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=805.0s)]
*  You got the money. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=806.0s)]
*  It's an incredible, and also the, you know, I'm sometimes suspicious regarding like the [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=807.0s)]
*  idea that they incinerate the drugs that they confiscate. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=814.0s)]
*  Why would they? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=819.0s)]
*  Someone come along and go, we got that. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=820.0s)]
*  We'll take care of it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=822.0s)]
*  We'll incinerate it. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=823.0s)]
*  Take it to the incinerator. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=824.0s)]
*  There's some fucking guys who just got out of the Naval Academy. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=825.0s)]
*  You know, like we got it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=828.0s)]
*  Yeah, we got it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=829.0s)]
*  No problem. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=830.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=831.0s)]
*  And they fucking squirt that off to some special boat. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=832.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=834.0s)]
*  And there's a precedent for this. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=835.0s)]
*  I mean, this isn't conspiracy. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=836.0s)]
*  Like that was proven. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=838.0s)]
*  Like this shit is, remember that CIA plane that crashed with all the cocaine in it? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=839.0s)]
*  Yeah, tons. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=843.0s)]
*  A lot of fucking shit. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=844.0s)]
*  Tons of cocaine. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=845.0s)]
*  It was overweight. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=846.0s)]
*  That's why it crashed. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=848.0s)]
*  Because it had so much cocaine. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=849.0s)]
*  Greed took them down. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=851.0s)]
*  I think it had something crazy, like a thousand pounds of coke. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=852.0s)]
*  That is so much coke. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=856.0s)]
*  I can't even imagine how much coke that is. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=857.0s)]
*  How much was it? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=859.0s)]
*  How many pounds was it? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=860.0s)]
*  3.3 tons. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=862.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=863.0s)]
*  3.3. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=864.0s)]
*  How much does an elephant weigh? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=865.0s)]
*  How many elephants worth of coke is that? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=867.0s)]
*  Dude, that's crazy. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=872.0s)]
*  That's CIA coke too. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=874.0s)]
*  You know, that's not bad coke. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=875.0s)]
*  That's like something incredible in there. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=877.0s)]
*  Oh my god, it's pure. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=880.0s)]
*  It's pure. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=881.0s)]
*  It's a rock flake. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=882.0s)]
*  It's the stuff that Eric Clapton used to get. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=883.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ, it just makes your entire body go numb. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=885.0s)]
*  I don't like coke though. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=889.0s)]
*  Look at all the coke that he had. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=891.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=894.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=895.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=896.0s)]
*  That is fucking crazy. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=898.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=901.0s)]
*  I can't get this fucking through. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=902.0s)]
*  Yeah, it happened to me in the five seconds I had on too. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=904.0s)]
*  Bunch of little hairs. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=906.0s)]
*  Holy shit man. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=907.0s)]
*  You want a napkin or something? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=909.0s)]
*  No, I'm alright. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=911.0s)]
*  How many bags of that do you think it consumed at like an average Coachella? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=912.0s)]
*  How many bags of that did Joey Diaz do during his prime? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=916.0s)]
*  That's what I want to know. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=919.0s)]
*  That might be like Joey Diaz's cocaine career right there. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=922.0s)]
*  Oh man, that'd be so cool if there was a way to look at all the drugs you've done. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=930.0s)]
*  Like if you could have them laid out in front of you over the course of a lifetime. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=935.0s)]
*  Oh my god, you'd be terrified. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=939.0s)]
*  It would be a room. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=940.0s)]
*  It would be exciting. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=941.0s)]
*  The amount of weed? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=942.0s)]
*  Oh dude. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=943.0s)]
*  The volume? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=944.0s)]
*  Just the sheer volume? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=945.0s)]
*  Booze. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=946.0s)]
*  Just think, all of it. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=947.0s)]
*  Just fucking piles of ketamine. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=949.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=952.0s)]
*  And if you do a chart to the size of your room versus the bad decisions you've made in your life, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=953.0s)]
*  I bet you would find some correlations. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=959.0s)]
*  Yes, that's for sure. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=961.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=963.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=964.0s)]
*  Absolutely man. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=965.0s)]
*  Yeah, you do have to, I mean there's just no way around it. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=966.0s)]
*  This is why I think karma is a wonderful and perfect way to articulate this, which is just [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=969.0s)]
*  like where you're at, everything around you, that's your karma. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=975.0s)]
*  Like this is your karma. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=980.0s)]
*  And then I love that because it keeps me from like going victim, you know? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=982.0s)]
*  When you look around at everything, you're like whatever it is, good. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=986.0s)]
*  You did that for yourself. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=991.0s)]
*  You did that to yourself. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=993.0s)]
*  And you just have to deal with it. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=994.0s)]
*  But not necessarily. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=997.0s)]
*  Babies get shot in drive-bys. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=999.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, okay, yes. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1001.0s)]
*  The baby thing, I mean there's some like theoretical, there's two ways to look at it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1003.0s)]
*  One, Occam's razor. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1008.0s)]
*  It's the same problem like theists face in trying to explain why awful things happen to babies. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1010.0s)]
*  You know what I think? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1016.0s)]
*  What? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1017.0s)]
*  I think karma is an element. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1018.0s)]
*  It's an element of existence. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1019.0s)]
*  But it's not a rule. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1022.0s)]
*  It's like the evil people live to be 100 and get away with it. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1024.0s)]
*  Well, for karma to really work, you need reincarnation. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1028.0s)]
*  That's where the math goes into the unquantifiable. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1031.0s)]
*  So for karma to really work, I mean it could work in a very simple mechanistic way with just one life. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1033.0s)]
*  But the idea is that there's different types of karma. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1040.0s)]
*  So there's the karma that's happening right now. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1045.0s)]
*  This is like flowering karma. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1048.0s)]
*  But there's karma like seeds of shit that you did a while ago. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1051.0s)]
*  Like when all of a sudden like someone calls you up and is like, hey, I'm your son. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1056.0s)]
*  You're like, what? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1060.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, I'm your kid. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1061.0s)]
*  That's like that seed has been in you and then it grows into the present moment. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1063.0s)]
*  And then there's karma that's the same idea but from past lives. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1068.0s)]
*  So that's where it gets really fucking weird. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1073.0s)]
*  And I guess there's some like very blurry way you could connect that to epigenetics. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1076.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1082.0s)]
*  It's like epigenetics is sort of the way like you get reincarnation into biology. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1083.0s)]
*  Except it's obviously not reincarnation. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1090.0s)]
*  It's your ancestors. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1092.0s)]
*  But it's essentially the same concept except one is quantifiable, the other is mystical. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1093.0s)]
*  I wonder if epigenetics is if you're if you're imparting some of your mind, some of your thinking to a child. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1099.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1111.0s)]
*  Would I wonder what effect it would have at the age you were when you had the child? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1112.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1119.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, like your Al Pacino's kid is going to be amazing. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1123.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1128.0s)]
*  He's 82. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1129.0s)]
*  82. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1130.0s)]
*  Shooting live rounds. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1131.0s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1132.0s)]
*  Into a 29 year old hottie. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1133.0s)]
*  And people are fucking mad at him. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1135.0s)]
*  What are they mad at? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1137.0s)]
*  They're mad because they think if you're that old. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1139.0s)]
*  You're not going to be able to care for that child. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1142.0s)]
*  Well, that's one that's the to me if you that's the most logical if you are going to be such an asshole that you want to that you're criticizing Al Pacino for procreating. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1143.0s)]
*  Don't you want more Pacino's? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1155.0s)]
*  He's a great fucking actor. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1156.0s)]
*  But but the other one is just like that's that age gap is insurmountable. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1161.0s)]
*  And I don't think it was his idea. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1166.0s)]
*  No. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1169.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think he he didn't he have a paternity test exclusive. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1170.0s)]
*  This is a real special coming at this time. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1176.0s)]
*  Al Pacino 83 break silence to celebrate 29 year old girlfriend's pregnancy after claims he demanded paternity test because she hoodwinked him. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1178.0s)]
*  Yeah, there is the actor revealed his girlfriend. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1186.0s)]
*  Noor Alfala was we're expecting last week. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1189.0s)]
*  Initial reports claimed that Al was not pleased over the baby. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1193.0s)]
*  But how do we know? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1197.0s)]
*  You know, it's like people say things like that because look right now, which he has now confirmed underneath. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1198.0s)]
*  It says has voiced his delight. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1204.0s)]
*  Sources told Daily Mail that wasn't true, which is now confirmed. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1206.0s)]
*  So that means it wasn't true. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1211.0s)]
*  Not true. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1213.0s)]
*  He was they didn't hoodwink him. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1214.0s)]
*  Yeah, see the way they phrase that. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1215.0s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1218.0s)]
*  Sources told Daily Mail that wasn't true, which he has now confirmed. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1219.0s)]
*  But look at the headline. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1222.0s)]
*  Look at the headline. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1224.0s)]
*  Fucking asshole. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1225.0s)]
*  This is so crazy. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1226.0s)]
*  They're basically saying this is not true. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1227.0s)]
*  So he's delighted to have a baby with his girlfriend. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1229.0s)]
*  And so people made up this story and we read it. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1232.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is the headline. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1235.0s)]
*  Why not just could be like Al Pacino chopped his kid into bits and then underneath say he didn't chop his kid into bits. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1237.0s)]
*  He's walking around. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1243.0s)]
*  He's smiling. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1244.0s)]
*  He looks great. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1245.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1246.0s)]
*  Listen, man, them anti-aging doctors get him on the happy sauce. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1247.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1251.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1252.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1253.0s)]
*  He's wearing comfortable shoes. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1254.0s)]
*  I would fucking cool. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1256.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1257.0s)]
*  I would wear those old men shoes. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1258.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1260.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1261.0s)]
*  Looks fine. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1262.0s)]
*  He looks great. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1263.0s)]
*  Going for walks. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1264.0s)]
*  How old is he? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1265.0s)]
*  83. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1266.0s)]
*  Who's that with him? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1267.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1269.0s)]
*  No, that's that other actor guy. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1270.0s)]
*  Isn't it? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1272.0s)]
*  No. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1273.0s)]
*  He looks like Andy Garcia a little bit. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1274.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1276.0s)]
*  That's what I was going to say. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1277.0s)]
*  You sure? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1278.0s)]
*  No. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1279.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1280.0s)]
*  It's probably his friend. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1281.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1282.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1283.0s)]
*  Dude, things to do in Denver when you're dead. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1284.0s)]
*  Underrated movie. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1285.0s)]
*  I don't think I ever saw that. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1286.0s)]
*  It was like their version. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1289.0s)]
*  It was like when Pulp Fiction had just come out and everybody wanted everything to be [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1290.0s)]
*  fucking cool. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1294.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1295.0s)]
*  And things became cool. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1296.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1297.0s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1298.0s)]
*  It was cool. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1299.0s)]
*  That's got to be cool for Tarantino to watch his shit echo out, to watch it shape culture. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1300.0s)]
*  That's so badass that you can do that. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1307.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1309.0s)]
*  He's very important. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1310.0s)]
*  He's very important because he's grandfathered in. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1311.0s)]
*  His movies are fucking bananas. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1313.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1315.0s)]
*  Once upon a time in Hollywood was fucking crazy. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1316.0s)]
*  And he's grandfathered in in a way like you know what a Tarantino movie is. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1319.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1323.0s)]
*  Have you seen Kill Bill? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1324.0s)]
*  Have you seen Inglorious Basterds? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1325.0s)]
*  Have you seen these movies? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1326.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1327.0s)]
*  Then shut the fuck up because you know what you're in for. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1328.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1330.0s)]
*  Whereas I think if you were a young director and that was like your first film, people [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1331.0s)]
*  would go, you know, the violence was so unnecessary. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1335.0s)]
*  It was so egregious. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1340.0s)]
*  It was so, you know, like the language, the way they talk. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1341.0s)]
*  People would find criticism in it, I think. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1345.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1348.0s)]
*  You see in interviews, he is like so frustrated with the like endless question he gets from [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1349.0s)]
*  the hack reporters who are like, violence. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1356.0s)]
*  What about the violence? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1359.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1360.0s)]
*  Like he just is done with that. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1361.0s)]
*  It must be, I mean, it's so annoying to get that same question over to make great movies. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1363.0s)]
*  What like when did journalism turn into scolding? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1369.0s)]
*  Because it wasn't all it wasn't the idea like you ask people questions. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1373.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1376.0s)]
*  And there isn't a moral twist to it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1377.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1379.0s)]
*  Or am I imagining it? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1380.0s)]
*  No, you're not imagining it. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1381.0s)]
*  Well, Barbara Walters used to do it a little bit. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1382.0s)]
*  You know, that was like she was kind of famous for being a tough interview. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1384.0s)]
*  She'd interview people and ask them like uncomfortable questions. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1387.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1390.0s)]
*  But it's like when it's got that, it's not even like they're asking you questions about [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1391.0s)]
*  shit you lied about. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1396.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1397.0s)]
*  They're making a moral judgment on you. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1398.0s)]
*  They're essentially saying, why are you a bad person? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1399.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1402.0s)]
*  Why are you making movies that show horrible things? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1403.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1405.0s)]
*  Like you're contributing to this horrible culture we have, which is not true. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1406.0s)]
*  That doesn't really work. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1410.0s)]
*  Like that correlation doesn't work because when you look at some countries like I think [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1411.0s)]
*  it's is it Japan that has a very high rate of they play a lot of violent video games, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1417.0s)]
*  but they have way less violence. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1424.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1425.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1426.0s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1427.0s)]
*  Did I read that? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1428.0s)]
*  Like they've tried to make correlations between violent video games and an actual violence. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1429.0s)]
*  That is so dumb. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1433.0s)]
*  And some people think that it might actually have the opposite effect, that there is a [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1434.0s)]
*  potential in some humans that they play those violent video games and they would get out [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1439.0s)]
*  any kind of wild, crazy instinct that they might have. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1444.0s)]
*  Like just I want you to imagine if epigenetics are real. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1448.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1452.0s)]
*  If you really there's a certain amount of us there in parting memories of being in war [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1453.0s)]
*  to other kids. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1461.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1462.0s)]
*  And this this is going into your baby and the mindset is going into your baby. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1463.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1468.0s)]
*  And it seems like that's an inescapable reality. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1469.0s)]
*  If there's a thing like a video game that lets them express that part of their brain [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1474.0s)]
*  without actually having a desire to do it. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1480.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1483.0s)]
*  No judgments. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1484.0s)]
*  But it almost makes sense that it would work to actually stop violence. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1485.0s)]
*  So the idea is like what is promoting violence? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1489.0s)]
*  And my my answer to that is like being a human poverty, you know, putting someone through [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1492.0s)]
*  a terrible life, forcing someone into bad situations. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1500.0s)]
*  That's that's what creates all of it. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1505.0s)]
*  And until we it's like very weird the way we address the problem of violence because [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1507.0s)]
*  we only look at it in terms of the action itself. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1514.0s)]
*  We don't want to go all the way back to the source. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1517.0s)]
*  We don't want to go back and try to fix the source. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1520.0s)]
*  Well, there's a big problem that happens when you start doing that is instead of being able [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1523.0s)]
*  to transform violent people into one dimensional sociopathic creatures. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1528.0s)]
*  Suddenly you like get back far enough and they're I don't know watching their mom and [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1536.0s)]
*  dad OD on heroin. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1541.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1542.0s)]
*  Or they're you know, whatever it is. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1543.0s)]
*  And again, not to say we don't need prisons and justice and all that. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1545.0s)]
*  But when you realize, oh, yeah, you're just looking at like a misplaced defense mechanism [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1548.0s)]
*  that this human had to learn because of whatever they fucking came out of. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1554.0s)]
*  Now, I'm not saying it's all sociopaths had horrific experiences. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1559.0s)]
*  I just looking at my own shitty defense mechanisms and then like going in therapy and connecting [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1564.0s)]
*  them to the past. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1569.0s)]
*  It's easy to see where like the aspects of my personality that are not conducive to harmony [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1570.0s)]
*  came from. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1576.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1577.0s)]
*  It's just that, you know, you're the kids are fucking so tough. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1578.0s)]
*  They have to adapt. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1581.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1582.0s)]
*  They kids adapt and they develop these weird defense mechanisms and then add to that the [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1583.0s)]
*  epigenetic component. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1588.0s)]
*  And then that what the United States has been at war 93 percent of its history. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1589.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1593.0s)]
*  So now you're just looking at like some like insane number of people saying that are transmitting [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1594.0s)]
*  memories of being at war. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1600.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1601.0s)]
*  And their children. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1602.0s)]
*  And, you know, that was my theory about why history was so barbaric. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1603.0s)]
*  But if you go far back enough, the pyramids. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1609.0s)]
*  So what happened between then and then and like, say, the Mongols? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1613.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1619.0s)]
*  What was the transition? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1620.0s)]
*  Why did people get so barbaric? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1622.0s)]
*  I think they're the people that survived the impact. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1625.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1628.0s)]
*  I think when the younger dry ice impact happened, if it happened 11,800 years ago, they believe. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1629.0s)]
*  I think the people that survived that were fucking monsters because they had to be. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1636.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1641.0s)]
*  I bet there was I bet it was a total breakdown of any civilization. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1642.0s)]
*  That's why civilization doesn't really pop up again for six thousand years. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1646.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1651.0s)]
*  I think for thousands of years we were monsters. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1652.0s)]
*  Dude, it's so funny that we on our planet are all of these megastructures that we just [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1656.0s)]
*  are like, I don't really know. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1665.0s)]
*  It's just that always blows my mind that like all over the planet. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1667.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1670.0s)]
*  Signs. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1671.0s)]
*  Do you see that one I posted on Instagram? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1672.0s)]
*  No. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1674.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1675.0s)]
*  This is fucking insane. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1676.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1677.0s)]
*  Um, shit. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1678.0s)]
*  What? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1679.0s)]
*  Where did I leave my phone? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1680.0s)]
*  You've got there's a phone right there. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1683.0s)]
*  Where? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1684.0s)]
*  Oh, it was hidden by my mic. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1685.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1687.0s)]
*  I'm going to send it to Jamie right now because you got it. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1688.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1691.0s)]
*  So check this out. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1692.0s)]
*  Give me some volume on this. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1694.0s)]
*  Central Java's lush Kedu plains in pursuit of this mythical peak near the little settlement [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1697.0s)]
*  of Barra. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1702.0s)]
*  They chopped and burned the strangling vegetation for six weeks and removed tons of volcanic [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1703.0s)]
*  ash. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1707.0s)]
*  What they discovered were marvelous figures cut in stone, thousands of them hidden beneath [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1708.0s)]
*  the volcanic jungle. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1712.0s)]
*  Believe to have been built in the eighth and ninth century, the Baroba Dear temple is an [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1713.0s)]
*  uncontested marvel whose intricate architecture continues to confound scholars. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1718.0s)]
*  Despite being one of the most important sites on Java, there is no written record of who [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1722.0s)]
*  erected it or what its intended purpose was. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1726.0s)]
*  Because there are no inscriptions or dates on the monument, historians must make educated [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1729.0s)]
*  guesses as to when it was most likely created. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1733.0s)]
*  The dating estimates are based purely off of architectural comparisons found elsewhere [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1736.0s)]
*  in Indonesia. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1740.0s)]
*  Given the magnitude of the construction, it appears remarkable that no ruler or dynasty [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1741.0s)]
*  took credit for it. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1745.0s)]
*  Baroba Dear is the world's biggest Buddhist temple and yet nobody knows who built it. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1747.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1751.0s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1753.0s)]
*  Yeah, Jamie, I'm sending you another one right now. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1754.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a bunch of these things. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1758.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of things like that. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1760.0s)]
*  They did just like, I don't know. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1762.0s)]
*  So who made this? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1764.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1765.0s)]
*  What are your thoughts on mud flood? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1766.0s)]
*  What's mud flood? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1768.0s)]
*  Mud flood theory. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1769.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1770.0s)]
*  I think that goes along with the Younger Dryas Impact Theory. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1771.0s)]
*  Yeah, but mud... [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1774.0s)]
*  Check this out though real quick. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1775.0s)]
*  I want you to watch this because this is fucking Benhanna's. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1777.0s)]
*  Same account. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1780.0s)]
*  We've set out to empty ponds that residents said were bottomless. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1781.0s)]
*  The Long You Caves, located in the village of Xin, Beichuan in Zhejiang province, China, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1783.0s)]
*  are a massive and majestic ancient underground world. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1787.0s)]
*  The Long You Caves, also known as the Shaonan High Stone Chambers, are thought to date back [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1790.0s)]
*  to at least 2,000 years and represent one of the largest underground excavations of ancient [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1794.0s)]
*  times, as well as an ongoing mystery that has confounded scientists from every discipline [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1798.0s)]
*  that has researched them. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1802.0s)]
*  Scientists from archaeology, architecture, engineering, and geology around the world [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1804.0s)]
*  have no understanding who or why the Long You Caves were carved into the earth. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1808.0s)]
*  Currently, 24 hand-carved caves encompassing a staggering 30,000 square meters have been [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1812.0s)]
*  found so far. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1817.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1818.0s)]
*  Each grotto is carved into solid siltstone and descends roughly 30 meters down, with [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1819.0s)]
*  stone rooms, bridges, gutters, and ponds. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1823.0s)]
*  The Long You Caves are supported by pillars that are evenly dispersed throughout the caves, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1826.0s)]
*  and the walls, ceiling, and stone columns are uniformly decorated with chisel marks [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1830.0s)]
*  in a pattern of parallel lines and ornate designs. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1834.0s)]
*  Despite their magnitude and the work required to build them, no indication of their construction, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1837.0s)]
*  or even their existence, has been discovered in archival sources. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1841.0s)]
*  Despite the fact that the whole excavation involved about a million cubic meters of stone, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1845.0s)]
*  there is no archaeological evidence explaining where that amount of stone went, nor is there [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1849.0s)]
*  evidence of the work being done. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1853.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1854.0s)]
*  Furthermore, there isn't a single historical source that mentions them, which is extremely [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1855.0s)]
*  remarkable given the scope of the undertaking. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1859.0s)]
*  Despite decades of analysis, the Long You Caves' mystery remains essentially unsolved. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1862.0s)]
*  What the fuck, dude? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1868.0s)]
*  You know, when people bash Hancock or try to dismiss it or debunk it, it's so frustrating [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1869.0s)]
*  to me because, like, first of all, nobody builds something that big underground just [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1880.0s)]
*  for fun. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1892.0s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1893.0s)]
*  There's a, like, I think we burrowed in. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1894.0s)]
*  We had to, like, whatever happened, or maybe something happened and then we were so scared [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1897.0s)]
*  it would happen again, we created, that's like an ancient survival shelter. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1903.0s)]
*  Well, they have them in Turkey as well. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1907.0s)]
*  There's these giant, is that where it was? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1909.0s)]
*  Where Randall told us about? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1912.0s)]
*  Dude, those are crazy. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1914.0s)]
*  Those are crazy with, like, air ducts and just insane. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1915.0s)]
*  And it's like, you don't do that unless you have to. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1919.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1922.0s)]
*  You don't burrow like a human ant high, ant nest. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1923.0s)]
*  Yeah, these things. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1926.0s)]
*  Like, the amount of resources it took to do what these people did, these are huge chambers [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1927.0s)]
*  carved into stone. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1934.0s)]
*  They think that the sky was like fucking raining lightning at one point. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1937.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1943.0s)]
*  Pole shift. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1944.0s)]
*  I mean, to me, the really eerie thing about all of this is the information gap. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1946.0s)]
*  It's that we have this massive, like, the hard drive has been, like, fragmented from, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1953.0s)]
*  like, we just don't know. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1961.0s)]
*  Thank God they made everything out of stone. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1963.0s)]
*  The thing about it is, whatever their technology was that existed to make the pyramids, it was different. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1966.0s)]
*  We make everything out of metal and glass, and that shit's not going to be here in 10,000 years. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1974.0s)]
*  It's just not going to be here. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1979.0s)]
*  It'll all get destroyed by just Mother Nature. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1981.0s)]
*  It'll just eventually get, like, I think they've done, like, analysis of, like, how much of a city will be [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1983.0s)]
*  around after 500 years of just vacancy. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1989.0s)]
*  How much? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1992.0s)]
*  And after 1,000 years. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1993.0s)]
*  Well, Detroit is a great example. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1994.0s)]
*  You see what happens in Detroit? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1996.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1997.0s)]
*  Houses are just getting taken over by trees. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=1998.0s)]
*  Trees go through the roof. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2000.0s)]
*  They grow through the floor. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2002.0s)]
*  They're literally devouring the homes. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2004.0s)]
*  The homes that are abandoned are getting eaten by trees. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2006.0s)]
*  So cool. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2009.0s)]
*  It's very cool. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2010.0s)]
*  But it shows you, it didn't take, I mean, nature has a long lifespan. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2011.0s)]
*  It doesn't give a fuck if it takes 100 years to reclaim a house or to take a house back. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2015.0s)]
*  Just get the roots of the tree to start busting through. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2020.0s)]
*  Everything's rained on. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2023.0s)]
*  The wood's soggy. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2024.0s)]
*  It just breaks apart. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2025.0s)]
*  It eats everything. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2026.0s)]
*  It eats everything. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2027.0s)]
*  Assimilates everything. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2028.0s)]
*  You know, there's like this, humans have this interesting, like, temporal blindness. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2029.0s)]
*  Like, the way that we, the way time passes for us produces the illusion of solidity. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2037.0s)]
*  And so that makes, that confuses people because they think that there's permanence here. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2043.0s)]
*  When if we could just see, if we lived longer and we could see time faster, we would feel like we were in some kind of like ocean of like undulating matter with these voids in it that we hang out in, like little bubbles in the ocean. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2048.0s)]
*  That's what we build our houses. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2064.0s)]
*  We wouldn't look at this place as solid. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2065.0s)]
*  We wouldn't think of it as like permanent. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2068.0s)]
*  This is why everyone was so like fucked up by the pandemic. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2070.0s)]
*  It's because, you know, you watch enough TV, you buy into the permanence of civilization. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2074.0s)]
*  Suddenly civilization like has a little, little rumble, like a little rat, like a house that needs some kind of serious repair. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2080.0s)]
*  It shifts on its, it shifts a little bit. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2088.0s)]
*  And everyone was like reminded, yeah, this, this doesn't last any more than any of that shit lasted. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2091.0s)]
*  And I think that's very disturbing for people who've really anchored themselves in some notion of permanence here. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2097.0s)]
*  Yeah. Freaks people out. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2104.0s)]
*  Well, I think that was a great ad for psilocybin. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2106.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2109.0s)]
*  Psilocybin. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2111.0s)]
*  That's what that was. That was an awesome ad for psilocybin. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2113.0s)]
*  Ozempic now has psilocybin in it, which is incredible. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2116.0s)]
*  That's better. That's better. You realize why you're fat. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2118.0s)]
*  It'll show you everything. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2127.0s)]
*  It'll show you all the wires. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2129.0s)]
*  You need it. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2131.0s)]
*  Underneath the board. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2132.0s)]
*  Dude, the whole thing, like this, this is what one of the really funny things about humans. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2133.0s)]
*  We are capable of ignoring internal realities. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2138.0s)]
*  Like we can somehow distract ourselves from the obvious cause of our suffering and equate it with a million other things than just what it actually is. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2142.0s)]
*  Like, dude, I got so fat during the pandemic, fatter than I've ever been. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2154.0s)]
*  It wasn't a mystery to me. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2159.0s)]
*  I knew why I was fat. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2161.0s)]
*  But it is curious that there's a way that you can just kind of ignore that. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2163.0s)]
*  Or like when I was drinking too much, you can ignore that you're waking up with a low level flu every morning. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2170.0s)]
*  You can somehow ignore it. It's so interesting. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2178.0s)]
*  And it's common. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2180.0s)]
*  Most people do it, especially because it's so fun to party. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2182.0s)]
*  It's so fun. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2186.0s)]
*  When they're out there partying and getting lit, it's a good time. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2188.0s)]
*  It is outside of the way it makes you feel the next day. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2191.0s)]
*  I mean, what a wonderful high. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2194.0s)]
*  I think what sucks about alcohol as a drug is that it's a depressant. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2196.0s)]
*  And if you just do like one drink and practice mindfulness with that and watch, you realize like this sucks. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2203.0s)]
*  It goes away real quick. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2211.0s)]
*  It lasts, I don't know, 45 minutes, an hour. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2213.0s)]
*  Then you want to go back up. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2215.0s)]
*  But your liver can't process it enough. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2217.0s)]
*  And that's where the hangover comes from. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2219.0s)]
*  Well, it's also dehydration. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2221.0s)]
*  Dehydration. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2223.0s)]
*  And glutathione. You can mitigate some of that with glutathione. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2225.0s)]
*  I saw that on Twitter. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2227.0s)]
*  Yeah. Liposomal glutathione I think is the best. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2229.0s)]
*  That's some stuff you squirt under your tongue and you like hold there and it gets into your bloodstream better. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2232.0s)]
*  But IV is the best. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2237.0s)]
*  If you can get an IV glutathione, that's the best. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2239.0s)]
*  Dude, if you're drinking so much that you're getting IVs, you got to think about that. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2241.0s)]
*  Or if you want to continue having a good time, but you want to take care of your body, get an IV. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2247.0s)]
*  You know what? Listen. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2252.0s)]
*  I sound like a prude. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2254.0s)]
*  I don't care if people out there... [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2256.0s)]
*  No, you don't sound like a prude. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2258.0s)]
*  You sound like Duncan Trussell right now. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2259.0s)]
*  This is who you are right now. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2261.0s)]
*  This is where you are honestly in your life. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2262.0s)]
*  And at other points in your life, you've been different. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2264.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2266.0s)]
*  That's normal. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2267.0s)]
*  That's how all of us are. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2268.0s)]
*  Incarnation. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2269.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that's why when you see someone who makes a turn for the best, like you see good things happen to them and they get the sparkle in their eye and they're excited. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2270.0s)]
*  You get excited too. It's fun. It's great. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2278.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2280.0s)]
*  Because it isn't great if you're always like that. It's really great if you figure it out. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2281.0s)]
*  It's like if your life has been kind of fucked and then you went, what am I doing? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2287.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2292.0s)]
*  And then pieced it back together again. Then you're thankful every day. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2293.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2295.0s)]
*  Then you're appreciative every day. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2296.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2297.0s)]
*  It's like those negative things are actually can be positive. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2298.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2301.0s)]
*  Dude, this is another like this is the other thing. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2302.0s)]
*  Like we look we focus on half of what's really happening. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2305.0s)]
*  Like people focus on the light and what's good. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2311.0s)]
*  And when things are going right for them, completely ignoring the fact that like in general when shit's going bad, like that's the stuff that's made you interesting. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2315.0s)]
*  Like down the road. That's what the stories are told about. That's like what the jokes are written about. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2326.0s)]
*  Not the good times like the the bad times. That's the that's the fertilizer, man. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2331.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2336.0s)]
*  There's a saying no mud, no lotus. You ever heard that before? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2337.0s)]
*  No, I like that though. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2341.0s)]
*  And the two are completely connected like especially if you zoom out of time. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2342.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2346.0s)]
*  And you'll realize you're growing out of your worst moment, hopefully for the better. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2347.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2351.0s)]
*  Like your worst moment actually made you smarter. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2352.0s)]
*  It made you like appreciate life more. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2355.0s)]
*  It made you like less like, dude, once I got my ball cut off, that was a fucking game changer, dude, because like you just you just learn how to be in the present moment. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2358.0s)]
*  Like you can't get off. You like your illusion of immortality is destroyed. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2369.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2376.0s)]
*  And you need that. Like it's really not good if you think you're going to live forever. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2377.0s)]
*  I think that's one of the good things about jujitsu. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2380.0s)]
*  You almost get close to death. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2383.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. All the time. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2386.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and you're so exhausted that you it's easier to live in the moment. You're so less anxious. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2388.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, I know I'm fucking beating a dead horse, but I think people need physical struggle, not just even exercise. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2395.0s)]
*  I think you need exercise, but you need you need you need to exercise. It's rigorous. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2404.0s)]
*  You know, and if you can only do walks, that's cool. Do that. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2409.0s)]
*  It's definitely better than not doing that. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2412.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2413.0s)]
*  Walks are great. Look at Al Pacino. He looks great out there. I bet he's got a trainer. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2414.0s)]
*  Look, I. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2417.0s)]
*  The point is like it helps your anxiety. It helps. It helps what you think in a big way. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2418.0s)]
*  And I'm thinking about it right now because I hurt my back a couple of days ago. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2423.0s)]
*  Like, actually, it's about a week now. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2428.0s)]
*  Deadlifting. Shouldn't have done it. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2430.0s)]
*  That will fuck you up. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2432.0s)]
*  Stupid. Stupid. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2433.0s)]
*  And it's not bad, but it's annoying. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2435.0s)]
*  And it's waking me up to this like reality of what happens when you don't work out for a few days because I haven't really been able to work out. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2439.0s)]
*  And I just started doing some stuff. I found I can do some stuff. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2449.0s)]
*  I just got to be careful because I don't want to react. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2452.0s)]
*  You know, because I don't want to take longer than it. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2454.0s)]
*  So two days in a row, I didn't work out, which is really rare for me. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2457.0s)]
*  And then also I'm like, oh, feel good. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2461.0s)]
*  I feel like, ugh, I feel like shitty. I feel off. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2463.0s)]
*  You know, like even the sun's like pep me up. I go outside and stare at the sun. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2467.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful day. It's beautiful. Beautiful clouds in the sky. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2471.0s)]
*  I'm like, eh. And I'm like, oh, you little pussy. You have to work out. You can't work out. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2474.0s)]
*  Oh my God. So now this is how imagine that times like 20 years for some people of eating shitty too. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2479.0s)]
*  Not even eating good. And then not working out. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2486.0s)]
*  And that's most people. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2489.0s)]
*  And so your like normal reality is this like you're in a kind of decayed building. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2491.0s)]
*  You haven't been. It's like walking the dog. You know what I mean? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2498.0s)]
*  Like if you don't take your dog for walks, what happens to the dog? Gets nervous. Gets weird. Right? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2501.0s)]
*  Gets depressed. Your body is your dog. Right. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2506.0s)]
*  You know, so it's going to do the same thing. It just gets all freaked out. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2509.0s)]
*  My dog needs exercise. He loves it. He loves it. I pick up that fucking ball. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2513.0s)]
*  I have a ball thrower. It's like an atlatl looking thing with a ball in the end of it. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2518.0s)]
*  So you can really chuck it. He gets so pumped. It's a great dog, man. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2523.0s)]
*  I go, dude, I got the ball. He's like, no way. I go, it's right here. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2527.0s)]
*  He's like, no, we're going to chase the ball. I'm like, fuck. Yeah. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2531.0s)]
*  So I get him all hyped up first. I get all excited. I get excited. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2534.0s)]
*  I go, oh, here we go. Here we go. He loves it. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2538.0s)]
*  Dude, my fucking poodle loves to get the ball. Will not bring it back. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2541.0s)]
*  You got to train him to do that. Oh, I've tried. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2547.0s)]
*  Retrievers, they do it instantly. Yeah. They just send them. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2549.0s)]
*  Marshall did it from the time he was a little bitty, bitty puppy. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2552.0s)]
*  I'd throw something for him. He'd grab it and bring it right back. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2556.0s)]
*  He didn't want to let it go, but he wanted to bring it back. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2559.0s)]
*  But if you say, come on, drop it, drop it, drop it. Hey, come on, dude. Come on, dude. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2561.0s)]
*  He'll drop it. Drop it. But then he's looking at you like he's smiling. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2565.0s)]
*  He wants to play a little tug of war, so I'll play a little tug of war with him. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2568.0s)]
*  He's so playful. Dude, that is definitely the coolest dog I've ever met. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2571.0s)]
*  He's amazing. Like that is a mystical creature. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2576.0s)]
*  You feel like you're being visited by some kind of like magic dog. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2578.0s)]
*  Dude. So happy. He's so happy. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2582.0s)]
*  And when I watch TV, he just hops up and cuddles. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2584.0s)]
*  He just wants to cuddle with me when I watch TV. Yeah. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2588.0s)]
*  Like that's what he does. He used to be a wolf. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2591.0s)]
*  Yeah. So you know there's a photo on his Instagram, the most recent photo that we put up. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2594.0s)]
*  Like this is me watching TV and homeboy just like hops up to hang out with me. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2600.0s)]
*  That's what he does. So sweet. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2606.0s)]
*  He hops up and he cuddles with you. He wants to cuddle. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2608.0s)]
*  He's just all love. Everybody. You come over the house like you never met him before. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2612.0s)]
*  He's like, you're my favorite person. You see this? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2617.0s)]
*  This is going to be the aliens posing with us in about 50 years. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2620.0s)]
*  I hope I don't have to wear a collar. I'll be a good boy. I won't run into traffic. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2624.0s)]
*  You're going to have to prove yourself first. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2628.0s)]
*  I used to love to take him with no leash when I lived in California because I'd take him in the canyons and we'd run around. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2630.0s)]
*  But unfortunately, that's a little more problematic where I live. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2635.0s)]
*  But I think dogs, they need something, man. They need exercise. They need love. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2640.0s)]
*  They're like a little version of you in some strange way. Yep. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2647.0s)]
*  You know, and they're a reflection of the owner in some strange way. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2651.0s)]
*  Do you buy into the idea that dogs and their owners kind of start looking like each other? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2654.0s)]
*  People always say that. I don't think I look like Marshall. He doesn't look like me. But he's the sweetest. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2658.0s)]
*  He does when you have your rough, rough costume on. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2663.0s)]
*  I don't though. That's the original Marshall. That's a wolf. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2666.0s)]
*  That's what's crazy, that that used to be a wolf. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2669.0s)]
*  That someone took the most ferocious predatory beast of the forest that operates in packs and they communicate telepathically. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2672.0s)]
*  And they turn that thing into this adorable love's punch. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2682.0s)]
*  Dude, okay. When was the last time this connects? When was the last time you read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2686.0s)]
*  Oh, it's been a long time. Okay. I think I must have read it when I was in high school and just didn't pay attention. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2692.0s)]
*  It's completely different from the movie. Like 100% different. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2699.0s)]
*  Maybe I never read it. Ken Kesey, he was like... Ken Kesey wrote it? Yeah. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2705.0s)]
*  Oh, no way. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2710.0s)]
*  So it's so psychedelic. The book is so psychedelic. But, you know, like the idea is that the character of McMurphy, Jack Nicholson's character, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2711.0s)]
*  and again, this is my own analysis. I don't know what the actual like literary analysis of it is. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2723.0s)]
*  He represents an undomesticated human. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2727.0s)]
*  And the people in the ward are humans that couldn't function in what he calls society the Combine. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2732.0s)]
*  They couldn't function in the Combine. So they're being brought into the asylums to get like re-domesticated so they can function in the Combine. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2741.0s)]
*  And he represents like an undomesticated human who enters into like a conditioning center designed to melt people back down, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2749.0s)]
*  build them back up and send them out into the world and be good functioning domesticated humans. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2757.0s)]
*  It's so good. It's so subversive, dude. It's such a brilliant like it's so funny how different the movie is from it. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2764.0s)]
*  Like Nurse Ratched. And again, because the narrator is chief, that big Native American dude who's in the movie, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2772.0s)]
*  that's the narrator of the book. It's being told from his perspective. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2780.0s)]
*  So you don't know like how much of what he's reporting is real and how much is like he's in a mental asylum. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2785.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that's amazing. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2791.0s)]
*  I know, it's so good. But according to him, Nurse Ratched can control time. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2793.0s)]
*  She'll speed up time so that like a year goes by in a day or slow down time so that like a second lasts like 10 years. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2798.0s)]
*  And that's how that's just one of the many ways that there she's basically torturing the people in the ward. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2811.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2817.0s)]
*  Constantly giving them drugs, tying them to their beds and always this threat. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2818.0s)]
*  This like threat is hovering, which is if you fuck up too much, if you get too angry at Nurse Ratched, who is a monster, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2824.0s)]
*  essentially the way he describes it, it's the demure, just the antichrist, then you know what happens? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2833.0s)]
*  They're going to fucking give you a lobotomy. They're going to cut out your brain, turn you into a zombie. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2838.0s)]
*  And you know they really did that. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2844.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2846.0s)]
*  They really did that. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2847.0s)]
*  They really did that. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2848.0s)]
*  They really did that. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2849.0s)]
*  I had a professor in college who used to work at an asylum and was the weirdest dude ever. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2850.0s)]
*  It was an awful class on like psychiatry. And he was kind of talking glowingly about lobotomies. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2856.0s)]
*  And like someone asked him like, I mean, what happened to the person? And he goes, they became a very good patient. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2864.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2870.0s)]
*  Totally was fine with the fact that they were like sticking chopsticks in people's, like brain severing the brain. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2872.0s)]
*  Dude, it's with a hammer, wearing that weird outfit. Why are they dressed like that? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2880.0s)]
*  And you know, they did a lot of those. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2885.0s)]
*  He did it. This guy, this doctor is credited with the majority of them. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2887.0s)]
*  So are they holding this guy down while they're doing this or is he anesthetized? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2893.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2897.0s)]
*  I don't see any anesthesia. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2898.0s)]
*  I see a strap. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2899.0s)]
*  I see straps and I see people holding his arms. Jesus Christ. You know how fucking terrifying that must be to feel that rod going into your brain knowing they're going to turn you into a vegetable? [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2900.0s)]
*  Yeah. Electroshock? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2910.0s)]
*  Dude, do you remember that guy that was running for vice president who had to admit that he went through electroshock therapy? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2913.0s)]
*  No. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2922.0s)]
*  Yes. It was during the McGovern Nixon campaign. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2923.0s)]
*  Eagleton. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2930.0s)]
*  Eagleton. It was McGovern's campaign, right? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2931.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2934.0s)]
*  McGovern was like one of the last hopes. He was one of the last like truly rational, what you really want out of someone that you consider a liberal, someone who's a compassionate, strong person. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2935.0s)]
*  People thought that he could win. They thought that he could win. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2951.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2958.0s)]
*  And it says 72, over two weeks after the 1972 Democratic Convention, Eagleton admitted the truth of news reports that he had received electroshock therapy for clinical depression during the 1960s. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2959.0s)]
*  McGovern initially said he would back Eagleton 100%, a thousand percent rather. Anybody didn't. He eventually had to let him go. And then it was too late. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2972.0s)]
*  Wait, that's what took him out? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2981.0s)]
*  That's what took him out. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2983.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2984.0s)]
*  Yeah. Electroshock therapy for depression. Just for depression. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2985.0s)]
*  Don't people say it works? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2989.0s)]
*  You would be awarded if you had depression today. Today in this victimhood society. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2990.0s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2995.0s)]
*  If you said this vice president, he suffered from clinical depression, but he sought help, he would be a shining example. Look at him. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=2996.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3004.0s)]
*  He's like us. He was clinically depressed. He got over it. He's a hero. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3005.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3009.0s)]
*  And then people would be fine with it. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3010.0s)]
*  Yeah, back then. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3012.0s)]
*  Back then it was a giant sign of weakness. And they would shock your brain with... [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3013.0s)]
*  I think it works. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3019.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3020.0s)]
*  Doesn't it have good results? I would rather not. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3021.0s)]
*  It's like smelling salt. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3024.0s)]
*  Have you watched videos of it? Because it's not like they're vaulting you the whole time. They put these rods on your head and you convulse for a second. It's very disturbing to watch. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3025.0s)]
*  Maybe it's like a reset. Control-Alt-Delete for your brain. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3033.0s)]
*  Maybe it's like, yeah. Maybe it's doing something similar to what the psychedelics are doing. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3036.0s)]
*  Maybe it's bringing you to a near-death experience because your body thinks it's being electrocuted. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3041.0s)]
*  Maybe it releases all of those psychedelic chemicals that they think it releases when you're in near-death experiences. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3045.0s)]
*  Did you see that they think they found the mechanism for why psilocybin treats depression? They did some study on rat brains in a Petri dish. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3052.0s)]
*  And they were watching the way it interacts with psilocybin. It blocks. Yeah, this is wild. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3061.0s)]
*  Is this someone getting zapped? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3065.0s)]
*  Nice hat for shocking people. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3067.0s)]
*  You have to wear a hat. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3069.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you don't need to have popcorn bags. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3071.0s)]
*  Oh, her toe's locked up. Looks like she got knocked out. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3073.0s)]
*  That's the receipt. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3077.0s)]
*  Don't show a whole lot of it, but that's it. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3080.0s)]
*  There's old ones that really show the whole thing. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3082.0s)]
*  Dude. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3086.0s)]
*  I wanted to bring something up, but I kept forgetting. I didn't want to interrupt your rant. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3088.0s)]
*  I retweeted something the other day about this boy that was raised by wolves in India. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3093.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3098.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen that? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3099.0s)]
*  No. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3100.0s)]
*  See if you can find that from a few days ago. I retweeted it. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3101.0s)]
*  I want to know if it's true. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3107.0s)]
*  I'm like, I was too lazy to Google it. I was like, I'm just bringing up with a podcast. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3109.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3113.0s)]
*  Well, I just retweeted it. I take no responsibility for retweeting. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3114.0s)]
*  It's the best way to fact check is just tweet something. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3118.0s)]
*  Also, retweets for me are just like, hmm, I think this is interesting. Maybe you will too. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3120.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3124.0s)]
*  That's what I do it for. So this is it. The wolf child in 1889. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3125.0s)]
*  Wow, how do you say that word? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3130.0s)]
*  Belandeshar? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3133.0s)]
*  Belandeshar. Belandeshar region of the Indian forest. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3134.0s)]
*  There resided Dina Sanachar, a feral child of merely six years old. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3138.0s)]
*  Sanachar lived amidst a wolf pack adapting to their ways and partaking in their activities. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3143.0s)]
*  This remarkable case serves as a vivid demonstration of the impact of environmental factors on human behavior. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3149.0s)]
*  It exemplifies how the availability of resources, the upbringing environment, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3155.0s)]
*  and the ability to adapt to surroundings during childhood can shape an individual's physical and mental abilities, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3159.0s)]
*  ultimately ensuring survival. I mean, this is kind of what we've been talking about. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3165.0s)]
*  Yeah, totally, man. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3171.0s)]
*  Look at that kid. Look at his face. That's crazy. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3173.0s)]
*  I mean, this is probably why you should be very careful about who your friends are, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3176.0s)]
*  because like you, you know, maybe we look like our dogs, but definitely like in a group of friends, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3180.0s)]
*  you like warp, you will shift into like something that like harmonizes with all of them. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3187.0s)]
*  So how about girls who like become boyfriends with serial killers and they go and kill people together? [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3193.0s)]
*  They pick up girls and kill them together. So crazy. People have done that. Crazy. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3198.0s)]
*  Like that's a real thing that's happened more than once, where a guy will be a serial killer [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3203.0s)]
*  and he'll convert his girlfriend to becoming a serial killer and they kill people together. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3208.0s)]
*  What does that conversation start off like? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3213.0s)]
*  According to us, a lot of math. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3215.0s)]
*  The only thing that's not true about that story is that he wasn't the only kid. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3217.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3222.0s)]
*  He was at least one of two at that time, they found. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3223.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3225.0s)]
*  There might have been a couple more. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3226.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3227.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3228.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3229.0s)]
*  Raised by wolves. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3231.0s)]
*  You know, it's like he got trained by a wolf. It's the reverse situation. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3233.0s)]
*  Look at that. He took up the habit of smoking cigarettes. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3239.0s)]
*  Wouldn't you if you were surrounded by wolves for your whole childhood? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3242.0s)]
*  I can't be relaxed. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3246.0s)]
*  It says there's at least five other. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3248.0s)]
*  What the fuck? At least five other? Did he learn how to talk and everything? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3250.0s)]
*  No, it said he never learned how to speak. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3254.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3256.0s)]
*  This reminds me of that video we played a few times from Dark White Underbelly, that family. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3258.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3264.0s)]
*  The boy in Sleeman's story died within five, died a few months after being brought back to human society. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3265.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3271.0s)]
*  Couldn't deal with it. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3272.0s)]
*  He smoked out of the wolf's den. Where did he get cigarettes? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3276.0s)]
*  No, did he? Is that what they're saying? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3280.0s)]
*  It said he smoked out of the wolf den. That's kind of weird, right? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3282.0s)]
*  So he lived in the wolf den? They kept him there? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3284.0s)]
*  Look, where was it? Wait, the boy in Sleeman's story, like the boy who smoked out of the wolf's den, died a few months after being brought back to human society. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3289.0s)]
*  No, it says like was smoked out of the wolf den. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3298.0s)]
*  Oh, what? I'm picturing it. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3300.0s)]
*  Like, smoke him out. Like George Bush, we're going to smoke him out of their holes. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3302.0s)]
*  Okay, I got you. You wasn't like... [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3305.0s)]
*  Remember when Debbie said that? We're going to smoke him out of their holes. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3306.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Dude, did you see that weird shit with Lindsey Graham? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3309.0s)]
*  Like the way he's like, we're going to kill Russians. Like it's the creepiest shit you ever saw. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3312.0s)]
*  Did you see that? No, I didn't. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3318.0s)]
*  Dude, it's so spooky. Let me see it. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3320.0s)]
*  You'll have to... I don't know where I saw it, but it's like he's like with Zelensky and he's like... [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3323.0s)]
*  I just started getting a stomach ache. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3327.0s)]
*  Dude, it's... Just you saying that, I started getting a stomach ache. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3329.0s)]
*  The way he talks about murdering people is really unnerving. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3331.0s)]
*  You know where I saw it? I saw it on Tucker Carlson's first Twitter episode. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3339.0s)]
*  Did you see that? No. Tucker Carlson's new show on Twitter? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3343.0s)]
*  So what is the show? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3346.0s)]
*  It's just him doing a monologue, basically. It's like a monologue. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3347.0s)]
*  So it's like his old show. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3351.0s)]
*  It's like his old show, but now he's been un-muzzled. So it's like Freebase Carlson. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3353.0s)]
*  He's going hard. And you know, it's weird. These days, I think a sign that you're looking at a real journalist is you worry about them. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3360.0s)]
*  You're like, you gotta shut up, man. They're gonna get you, man. What are you doing? Are you safe? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3372.0s)]
*  Because it gives you that feeling. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3379.0s)]
*  And you know what's really interesting about it? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3382.0s)]
*  I get people on the left are furious with him and just like people on the right hate Rachel Maddow or whatever. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3385.0s)]
*  But he was mocked for talking about the UFO wreckage stuff. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3392.0s)]
*  People in the comments were like, he's talking about UFOs. Like he saw a crop circle and talked about it. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3398.0s)]
*  Let's hear it. Here it is. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3406.0s)]
*  Live free or die. And we will be. And the Russians are dying. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3409.0s)]
*  It's the best money we've ever spent. Thank you so much. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3413.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3417.0s)]
*  I expect in the coming days and weeks for the Ukrainian counter offensive to yield results. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3418.0s)]
*  And I'm here to tell you that the last chapter of the Battle of Baghmut is yet to be written. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3426.0s)]
*  I'm here to tell you that the Russian military is about to have holy hell unleashed upon them. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3436.0s)]
*  That kind of guy you don't want running anything. You don't want that guy. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3445.0s)]
*  You don't want that guy running a fucking Starbucks. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3450.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want. He's a that was creepy. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3452.0s)]
*  Just the way to talk that way about something with so much weight on it. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3456.0s)]
*  Yeah, we made the point that you're like talking like he's in a movie. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3462.0s)]
*  You're celebrating human, the human debt, like essentially the human sacrifice of conscripts. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3465.0s)]
*  Like you're celebrating human sacrifice and some of its human sacrifice that we've written off as being OK. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3470.0s)]
*  Russia gave him there's an arrest warrant out for him for those comments that he made from Russia. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3478.0s)]
*  He said my crime was speaking truth to power. God damn, I hate that phrase. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3482.0s)]
*  That phrase gets fucking thrown around by a lot of morons. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3488.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, I know it's a real phrase and when they mean it, I get it. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3492.0s)]
*  But my crime was speaking truth to power. That fucking freaks me out. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3497.0s)]
*  It freaks hawks are creepy, dude. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3502.0s)]
*  Like it's like somehow they've managed to get to a place where they can publicly celebrate human violent human like the fail. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3505.0s)]
*  Just essentially like if war is a failure of humanity. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3515.0s)]
*  Right. Like that's so people like him are celebrating the death. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3518.0s)]
*  You're not like it doesn't matter if you're doing the right thing. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3523.0s)]
*  You those are still people. It's also the way he's talking. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3528.0s)]
*  He loves it. It's just I don't want anyone who gets to make those choices to talk like that. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3531.0s)]
*  Says my crime was speaking truth to power, said Graham. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3537.0s)]
*  Russia has illegally invaded Ukraine. Putin has committed war crimes on an industrial level. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3540.0s)]
*  And I'm going to keep talking about it. Freedom allows you to say the things I said. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3545.0s)]
*  We live in a country where you can criticize your leaders. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3549.0s)]
*  Well, that's kind of true. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3552.0s)]
*  But it's just what what you said with the magnitude of the weight of your words. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3554.0s)]
*  It's on the line in the whole world's listening. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3560.0s)]
*  And that's what you said. Yeah. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3563.0s)]
*  The best money we ever spent. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3565.0s)]
*  Like that's a crazy thing to say. The whole thing is the Russians are dying. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3567.0s)]
*  We're going to. It's not a fucking football game, man. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3572.0s)]
*  Exactly. Like this isn't a sport. Exactly. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3575.0s)]
*  Like what you like just like you can can you can clearly from like the micro there times where you're going to have to use violence in a society. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3578.0s)]
*  There's times where someone's losing their mind, swinging a samurai sword in the middle of the street and or whatever. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3588.0s)]
*  And like cops have to take them out. There's obviously this is obvious. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3595.0s)]
*  But like to then like celebrate that you had to like kill a lunatic or something is so dark. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3600.0s)]
*  Like why not collect their scalps, Lindsey Graham? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3608.0s)]
*  If you're so into this shit, why don't we start scalping the fucking Russians? [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3612.0s)]
*  We'll just cut pieces of start wearing a necklace of Russian fingers. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3617.0s)]
*  You know, if you're so into murdering people and also ignoring the demographics of the people who are getting fucking slaughtered, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3623.0s)]
*  I mean, you can see videos of them being dragged out of their houses and taken to the middle of Ukraine to just get thrown into a fucking blender, dude. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3632.0s)]
*  And that's what he's tap dancing about. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3643.0s)]
*  He's it's crazy. It's crazy. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3646.0s)]
*  It's crazy. And that way of talking that he just did is like it's a standard politician's way of addressing a very complex issue. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3649.0s)]
*  They do it with like there was a there was a rah rah aspect to that. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3660.0s)]
*  We're going to unleash holy hell on them Russians. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3665.0s)]
*  Pep rally. Pep rally. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3668.0s)]
*  Pep rally for murdering people, dude. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3669.0s)]
*  Yeah, because it is a football thing. Like saying it like that. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3671.0s)]
*  That's like we're going to go fucking kick their ass. It's a team. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3674.0s)]
*  Right. And but for sure, there is no financial motivation in what Lindsey Graham is doing. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3677.0s)]
*  No one would do that. No, all that money is just a coincidence. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3683.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's so fucking dark, Matt. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3688.0s)]
*  Like you it's really so confusing to me because I guess I'm a naive idiot that people like that even exist. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3690.0s)]
*  Well, also that they exist on the left now. That's what's weird. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3699.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, you mean like because the right because the general like like Lindsey Graham, is he a Democrat or Republican? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3704.0s)]
*  Republican. He's a Republican. Right. He's a Republican. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3712.0s)]
*  So they're all united on this idea. Of course, he's a Republican. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3715.0s)]
*  But they're all united on this idea that they should continue. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3718.0s)]
*  There's no one, whether it's a Republican or a Democrat, like the Democrats are always antiwar. Always. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3723.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Always. Oh, yeah. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3730.0s)]
*  This is the first time where the Democrats are like wholesale buying the narrative. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3732.0s)]
*  And we have to stop Putin. We have to support Ukraine. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3739.0s)]
*  I mean, how many Democrat peaceful people that used to have syringes in their Twitter bio now have a Ukraine flag? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3742.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. You if you articulate just the general common sense reality that war is a war. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3749.0s)]
*  We don't want war. We don't want war. That we want. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3761.0s)]
*  We don't want anyone to die. I don't want Russians to die or Ukrainians to die. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3765.0s)]
*  We want to elevate our species to the point where somehow we can get along with each other without like resorting to incinerating people. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3769.0s)]
*  And because the message is coming from Trump, the people completely dismiss it. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3780.0s)]
*  But did you see that interview with him where he said, I would end the Ukraine war in a day. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3787.0s)]
*  Right. And he said, do you not want Ukraine to win? Do you want Russia to win? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3792.0s)]
*  He goes, no, I want people to stop dying. Yeah. Yeah. I saw that. Dude, it's perfect. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3798.0s)]
*  You're allowed to say that. Let's find that. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3805.0s)]
*  Because they're playing gotcha on a subject. They're doing gotcha interview real quick. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3808.0s)]
*  You don't have much time with them. So you've got to get a gotcha. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3816.0s)]
*  And they're doing this with a subject that literally has the fate of the world in front of it. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3819.0s)]
*  Right. Because if nuclear war breaks out because of all this and these people are just flippantly supporting this continued conflict [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3826.0s)]
*  with no talk at all about some sort of a compromise, some sort of a conversation, or just starting a conversation, just starting one. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3837.0s)]
*  Let's hear what he says. If I were president and I say this, I will end that war in one day. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3847.0s)]
*  It'll take 24 hours. I know Zelensky well. I know Putin well. I would get that ended in a period of you can break that deal. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3853.0s)]
*  100 percent. It would be easy. That deal would be easy. A lot of it has to do with the money. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3862.0s)]
*  A lot of it has to do with the military, you know, that we're giving. But I would get that deal done within 24 hours. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3867.0s)]
*  That war has to be stopped. That war is a disaster. Final thought. Are you going to win next year? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3874.0s)]
*  Cool, Sax. No, that's not a very good chance. That's not the same interview. There was another interview. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3881.0s)]
*  There was another interview. A woman was interviewing him, I believe, and she asked, I think it was a woman, asked if he wanted Russia to win. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3887.0s)]
*  It was some weird gotcha interview. He said, I want people to stop dying. Yeah, this is it. That's the CNN thing. Yes. Yeah. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3898.0s)]
*  Let me just put it nice away. If I'm president, I will have that war settled in one day. 24 hours. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3908.0s)]
*  How would you settle that war in one day? I'll meet with Putin. I'll meet with Zelensky. They both have weaknesses and they both have strengths. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3916.0s)]
*  And within 24 hours, that war will be settled. It'll be over. It'll be absolutely over. Do you want Ukraine to win this war? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3924.0s)]
*  I don't think in terms of winning and losing. I think in terms of getting it settled so we stop killing all these people and breaking down this country. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3930.0s)]
*  So I paraphrased it. I fucked it up. But that's essentially his answer. I think maybe even after that, he might have actually said, I want people to stop dying. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3939.0s)]
*  It's crazy that that's a controversial statement. And it's crazy that people can't, like because he's saying it, they invalidate it. Exactly. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3947.0s)]
*  It's so weird. Like the truth, the idea is there's the truth and it doesn't matter if it's coming out of a radio that has woven into it human skull fragments that manson own the radio. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3957.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter if the radio is spewing truth. That's truth. It's truth. And I always thought that was sort of the general consensus among people who were saying it's not good to blow each other up. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3977.0s)]
*  I get it. It's like, okay, well, then what about when invasions happen? What about when land grabs happen? When some new creepy imperialism happens or Hitler happens or whatever? What about that? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=3993.0s)]
*  But like, look at the fucking letter Gandhi wrote a letter to Hitler. Did you ever see that? Yeah. You know, like the idea is like you just try. It's like worth trying. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4007.0s)]
*  Get people to talk, hang out, sit down. Even if you can't fail worse than war. Right. So any attempt at like stopping a war without World War Three or violence or whatever, it's glorious. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4018.0s)]
*  Even if it fails, even if it makes you look like a weak, pathetic piece of shit, long term, you're going to look great. If you were a peacemaker in the world versus Lindsey Graham, Lindsey Graham's man, history does not look at them in a kind way. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4034.0s)]
*  No, they're the evil characters when you watch a YouTube video on 9-11. It's these people behind the scenes. It's these people that lie about weapons of mass destruction. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4052.0s)]
*  It's like there's like a type of person that you see that gets into office. And there's this like there's this shameless politician aspect of them that just gives me the creeps. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4065.0s)]
*  Dude, just gives me the creeps and anybody talks like that about war because it's so consequential. Everything's on the line. Humanity's on the line. Civilization's on the line. The future of your children's on the line. Everything's on the line. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4077.0s)]
*  Until like make it and boil it down to a rah rah football pep rally speech is crazy. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4091.0s)]
*  You know, an AI wizard out there who wants to do some kind of like something that will probably be very controversial needs to like put together a montage of the videos of all the drones blowing up Russians and replace the adults with kids so that you see the children version of them being blown up. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4100.0s)]
*  You know, because that's the weird thing about it. Once you get to a certain height, at that point, we celebrate you getting exploded. But you know, like if kids were doing this shit, like we would end it immediately regardless. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4124.0s)]
*  This is like I don't if my kids are squabbling in like one of them bites the other or something or like whatever, like it doesn't matter anymore about the fairness or whatever is happening. It's like we've got to you can't do that. Stop the violence. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4140.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah, man. It's that's the thing is like for to conduct a successful war. You really have to disconnect from the human reality of who is fighting the wars. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4154.0s)]
*  If you sounds per goes, this is named per goes in the guy who runs his own like battalion, the private contractor was like fighting back moot that that crazy guy. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4165.0s)]
*  I'm not I don't know where basically there's a video that popped up of like someone getting their head smashed in with a hammer. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4175.0s)]
*  It was that so it's like these people. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4183.0s)]
*  What is who is that? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4186.0s)]
*  It goes head smashed in. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4187.0s)]
*  He was somebody who didn't want to fight anymore. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4188.0s)]
*  That's what it was. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4190.0s)]
*  That's what it was. Yeah. And to send the signal out like this is what happens if you try to run away. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4191.0s)]
*  We'll just smash your head in. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4195.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4197.0s)]
*  So it's like the he was a fellow Russian. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4198.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, man. I mean, that's the idea is like stop. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4201.0s)]
*  Just know that the people who are out there thought it was a training mission, apparently. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4205.0s)]
*  And if they try to defect and get out of there, whatever, they're probably going to get killed. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4211.0s)]
*  So it's not like you're not a Russian guy that got killed or a Ukraine guy killed. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4217.0s)]
*  I thought I was a Russian dude. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4221.0s)]
*  You're saying and I'm reading about him. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4222.0s)]
*  Do you think he says he recruited prisoners? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4223.0s)]
*  Is there any chance he said he recruited? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4225.0s)]
*  This is the guy that got killed. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4229.0s)]
*  The progrosian is the guy who controlled the troops. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4230.0s)]
*  Is he the guy that got killed with the hammer? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4235.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4236.0s)]
*  No, no. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4237.0s)]
*  The guy that got killed with the hammer was just a soldier. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4238.0s)]
*  Soldier. What am I talking about? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4240.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4241.0s)]
*  Well, I want it's just too strong. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4242.0s)]
*  It's so you know what? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4243.0s)]
*  You know what? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4244.0s)]
*  I saw you go deeper than this time. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4245.0s)]
*  I didn't do it. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4246.0s)]
*  And so many of these episodes, I forget the potency of this. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4247.0s)]
*  What you have here. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4252.0s)]
*  It's so good. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4253.0s)]
*  But yeah, man. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4254.0s)]
*  So this guy ordered people out there. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4256.0s)]
*  And then when people said, hey, this isn't a fucking training run. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4259.0s)]
*  This is a real war. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4265.0s)]
*  Yeah. I don't want to fight in this war. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4267.0s)]
*  That's what I read. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4268.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4269.0s)]
*  And they killed that guy with a hammer. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4270.0s)]
*  The guy seemed like resigned to his fate. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4271.0s)]
*  Dude. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4273.0s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4274.0s)]
*  The thing is, when you so like the big critique of Russia that Lindsey Graham has is you get arrested if you say anything. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4275.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4283.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4284.0s)]
*  Meaning if we have prisoners who've been quote recruited fighting out there, then Russia is sending anti-Putin people into a meat grinder to die. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4285.0s)]
*  So you spoke out against Russia. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4298.0s)]
*  You've been in a Russian prison. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4299.0s)]
*  You get recruited. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4301.0s)]
*  And then they just send you into all of these weapons given to Ukraine by the Western world. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4302.0s)]
*  You're just dead. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4308.0s)]
*  It's a death sentence. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4309.0s)]
*  So that's the, you know, so when you break it down at that level, suddenly these aren't like these fucking Russians are like, let me go invade the place where my mother-in-law lives. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4310.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4320.0s)]
*  You know, it's like, it's not like that. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4321.0s)]
*  It's like many of them are having, they have to do it. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4323.0s)]
*  There's no way out unless you want to die. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4327.0s)]
*  So you have to choose like, which way do I want to die? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4330.0s)]
*  Want to get blown up by some fucking Ukrainian drone or do I want to get my head smashed in or just shut? [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4333.0s)]
*  On YouTube. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4339.0s)]
*  On YouTube. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4340.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4341.0s)]
*  It's really fucked up, man. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4342.0s)]
*  In all fairness, I think YouTube would take that down. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4347.0s)]
*  I think they changed it. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4350.0s)]
*  I think they're changing. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4351.0s)]
*  Aren't they? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4353.0s)]
*  Did they change it? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4354.0s)]
*  Aren't they? [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4355.0s)]
*  Did I dream that YouTube was like loosening up so we could watch those videos again on YouTube? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4356.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4360.0s)]
*  I could be wrong, but I feel like there was some shift in their censorship model was happening, but I could be wrong about that. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4361.0s)]
*  Well, it's not when it comes to RFK Jr. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4367.0s)]
*  They're deleting his old podcasts. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4370.0s)]
*  They deleted one from Theo Vaughn from a year ago and they had deleted one from Hot Box with Mike Tyson, which is more than a year ago too. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4373.0s)]
*  I did not know that. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4380.0s)]
*  They just did it. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4382.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4383.0s)]
*  They just started doing that. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4384.0s)]
*  Isn't that illegal if someone's running for president? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4385.0s)]
*  You can't do that, right? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4388.0s)]
*  I don't know what you could say that it's because of misinformation and this is because he talks about vaccines. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4390.0s)]
*  He was an environmental attorney before he was anything. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4398.0s)]
*  And, you know, his whole thing was trying to hold companies accountable for what they're doing by ruining the environment and lying about it. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4404.0s)]
*  And for them to take that guy and say, you can't do that with other stuff. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4415.0s)]
*  You can't talk about other stuff like how come no one wants to hear him out? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4422.0s)]
*  How come no one wants to hear him out with it? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4426.0s)]
*  That book, The Real Anthony Fauci, is fucking terrifying. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4428.0s)]
*  And if it's not true, why isn't he getting sued? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4434.0s)]
*  You know, if that book is true, if all the things that he's saying and he has references for everything, if it's all accurate, we should all read that book. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4437.0s)]
*  Everyone should read that book. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4446.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4448.0s)]
*  Because if it's true, it's terrifying. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4449.0s)]
*  I think censorship is something that's been captured by an industry that's forced you into becoming a source of income for them. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4451.0s)]
*  Dude, censorship is, has this component of condescension in it. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4461.0s)]
*  It is really like that to me is the the worst part is essentially you're saying you're too dumb to parse this information in a rational way. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4466.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4476.0s)]
*  You're saying, you know, you're trying to protect your brain and we have to protect you. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4477.0s)]
*  That is really like, like, first of all, if you do, like, that's bad parenting in general. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4480.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4488.0s)]
*  Like, the idea would be that you, like, teach your kid to confront false things, learn why they're not real. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4489.0s)]
*  And then instead of, like, trying to prevent your kid from seeing, like, everything, you know, I mean, I don't obviously, like, I'm not letting my kid watch Blade Runner or some shit like that. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4496.0s)]
*  But just that if you get too overprotective with your kids, like, try to hide death from them, for example, that sort of thing. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4506.0s)]
*  Like, you got to trust we can deal with it. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4513.0s)]
*  It's safe for us to encounter all forms of information. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4516.0s)]
*  Well, the problem is, when the time they're real little, you're lying to them. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4521.0s)]
*  Santa Claus is going to come to bring you all the toys. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4524.0s)]
*  He's going to come down the chimney. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4527.0s)]
*  He's going to magically appear. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4529.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4531.0s)]
*  Just teach your kid what the word egregore means, and you can do Santa Claus ethically. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4532.0s)]
*  What's egregore? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4537.0s)]
*  Egregore is, like, the name for, like, a thing that exists within the minds of a lot of people. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4538.0s)]
*  It's an egregore. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4544.0s)]
*  So, like, if enough people believe in something, does it have a material reality? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4545.0s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4550.0s)]
*  But within the psychic mind space, it's real. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4551.0s)]
*  It's there. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4555.0s)]
*  Right, like, Santa Claus is a thing. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4556.0s)]
*  Yeah, an egregore. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4557.0s)]
*  Santa Claus is an egregore. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4558.0s)]
*  There's no, obviously, there's no real Santa Claus, but there is a very vivid, living entity within the interconnected minds of everyone who believes in it. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4559.0s)]
*  That's an egregore. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4569.0s)]
*  The problem is, if you tell your kid that Santa's an egregore, and then your kid's going to tell all the kids at school, and then you're the asshole, that's the problem. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4570.0s)]
*  I'll be honest, Joe. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4578.0s)]
*  I have not told my kids Santa's an egregore. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4579.0s)]
*  I just thought of it. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4581.0s)]
*  I'm like, maybe I'll do egregore this Christmas. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4582.0s)]
*  But yeah, you're right. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4585.0s)]
*  It's like a battle. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4586.0s)]
*  Like, you get kids together, you know, and you talk to parents, like, have you done the Santa Claus talk? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4587.0s)]
*  No. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4594.0s)]
*  Like, how old are they? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4595.0s)]
*  They're five, five and six. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4596.0s)]
*  Like, if you get to that age where you're like, OK, when are you going to tell these kids? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4597.0s)]
*  When do you tell? [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4601.0s)]
*  When do you tell them? [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4602.0s)]
*  They don't like it when you tell them either. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4603.0s)]
*  They get very sad. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4604.0s)]
*  So is that like, is that what these people think about us? [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4605.0s)]
*  But it's weird that they grow up with a lie. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4608.0s)]
*  That's what I don't like. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4611.0s)]
*  You grow up with a lie. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4613.0s)]
*  It's a stupid lie. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4614.0s)]
*  And you convince a child that this lie that we all have mutually agreed upon, it's fucking kind of Santa Claus is kind of dangerous because it sets people up at a very early age for the reality that the possibility rather that everything you believe in is bullshit. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4615.0s)]
*  It's misinformation, Joe. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4634.0s)]
*  But everything you believe in is propaganda. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4635.0s)]
*  It's propaganda by your parents to get you to be good. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4638.0s)]
*  You better be good. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4642.0s)]
*  You better be nice. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4643.0s)]
*  Better than hell. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4644.0s)]
*  At least you're not doing the hell thing. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4645.0s)]
*  Santa Claus is coming to town. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4646.0s)]
*  He knows when you are sleeping. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4647.0s)]
*  He knows when you're awake. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4648.0s)]
*  He knows if you've been bad or good. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4649.0s)]
*  So be good for goodness sake. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4650.0s)]
*  He's breaking child predator laws by monitoring kids. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4651.0s)]
*  Santa Claus is like the ultimate [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4652.0s)]
*  It's a panopticon, man. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4673.0s)]
*  It's a fucking materialistic panopticon. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4675.0s)]
*  You're being constantly monitored by some mythical North Pole thing that's probably like, I guarantee, if we look at the way Santa is paying those fucking elves, I guarantee it's like they don't want to be there. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4677.0s)]
*  Elves don't want to be in the North Pole. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4690.0s)]
*  The whole thing's fucked up. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4692.0s)]
*  You add elf on the fucking shelf. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4693.0s)]
*  You know about elf on the shelf? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4695.0s)]
*  We had to do that. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4697.0s)]
*  Elf on the shelf. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4698.0s)]
*  Now you have like a little fucking plastic security camera that's watching your kids all the time. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4699.0s)]
*  If they touch it, it loses its magic. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4704.0s)]
*  Hilarious. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4707.0s)]
*  So you put into the kids this like neurotic thing. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4708.0s)]
*  It's like, think of how many kids have touched elf on the shelf and not told their parents and live with that guilt. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4710.0s)]
*  Like knowing they fucking depleted the elves magic. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4716.0s)]
*  It's not coming back. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4720.0s)]
*  This is sinister at one level. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4721.0s)]
*  You know, it is really fucking weird. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4724.0s)]
*  It's lies. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4727.0s)]
*  And it's lies that are unnecessary. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4728.0s)]
*  It's not lies about like something stupid. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4730.0s)]
*  It's lies about the like whether or not there's elves flying around your fucking house. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4735.0s)]
*  Like you're getting your kids to believe in nonsense like very early on. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4740.0s)]
*  Instead of just like reading fun books where they know it's pretend. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4744.0s)]
*  Where you can just pretend. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4749.0s)]
*  And also when you realize like the whole thing is just connected to getting the economy to get a little better once a year. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4751.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4758.0s)]
*  The whole thing is just to drive up the fucking economy by manipulating children into believing in a fucking Santa Claus. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4759.0s)]
*  That is wild. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4766.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4768.0s)]
*  You were saying something about psilocybin, the psilocybin study. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4769.0s)]
*  You about something about connecting to brain and memory. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4772.0s)]
*  You're saying what they recently discovered. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4777.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4779.0s)]
*  They did some study. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4780.0s)]
*  The article there was really funny because they're like, OK, we found the receptors that psilocybin is working on. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4781.0s)]
*  And the way it affects the receptors is a thousand times more potent than antidepressants. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4787.0s)]
*  And now that they know where these receptors are, theoretically they could invent a medicine that doesn't get people high. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4792.0s)]
*  It's so sad. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4800.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4801.0s)]
*  You're celebrating that? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4802.0s)]
*  Like why? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4803.0s)]
*  We already have the medicine. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4804.0s)]
*  The medicine works. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4806.0s)]
*  Why do we need to synthesize that? [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4807.0s)]
*  It grows out of the ground. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4809.0s)]
*  But they're like, now that we understand it, we can synthesize it and take away one of the best things about it. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4811.0s)]
*  Duncan, we figured it out and it's the best money ever spent. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4817.0s)]
*  Oh, God damn. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4820.0s)]
*  Same people. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4821.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4822.0s)]
*  Same people. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4823.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4824.0s)]
*  Instead of saying, hey, we should legislate. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4825.0s)]
*  We should change the laws. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4827.0s)]
*  We really need to rally about this. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4829.0s)]
*  This is an actual important medication for humanity. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4831.0s)]
*  It actually could make people nicer. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4835.0s)]
*  It might have made people people. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4837.0s)]
*  Just the problem is it's apparently too easy to grow those fucking mushrooms, man. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4839.0s)]
*  Yeah, they want to be here. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4845.0s)]
*  It's too easy. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4847.0s)]
*  So it's like you can't grow an antidepressant. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4848.0s)]
*  You can't fucking create a Lexapro aquarium. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4852.0s)]
*  That's exactly what the problem is. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4854.0s)]
*  And we're captive. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4856.0s)]
*  We're captive by this industry that uses you to make money on a regular basis and will oppose anything that gets in the way of that profit, even if that thing is overall net positive for humanity. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4858.0s)]
*  Horrible. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4872.0s)]
*  Which psilocybin is. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4873.0s)]
*  Horrible. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4874.0s)]
*  Dude, I just revisited the thalamide thing. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4875.0s)]
*  You ever look into that? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4877.0s)]
*  Thalidomide. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4878.0s)]
*  Thalidomide. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4879.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4880.0s)]
*  That shit. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4881.0s)]
*  Terrific. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4882.0s)]
*  It's kind of like the United States does the, what's the name of the incident they did in Vietnam that triggered the war, like the Gulf of Tompkins. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4883.0s)]
*  So they do that. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4892.0s)]
*  And then we get in this stupid war. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4894.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4896.0s)]
*  Then we get the yellow, the yellow cake, the yellow cake thing to justify the invasion of Iraq. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4897.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4904.0s)]
*  Comes out. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4905.0s)]
*  That wasn't real. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4906.0s)]
*  We just buy into that somehow now we got better. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4908.0s)]
*  Like now it all makes sense. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4913.0s)]
*  So the thalidomide, it's like, it's a perfect example of a pharmaceutical company pushing shit that they knew was hurting kids. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4914.0s)]
*  They wanted to sell it in the United States. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4925.0s)]
*  They knew it was fucking kids up. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4927.0s)]
*  They somehow warped the studies in a way. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4929.0s)]
*  They warped them so much. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4931.0s)]
*  It was one woman, I can't remember who, who was like, they were trying to get the right to sell it in the United States. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4933.0s)]
*  And she's looking at the study like, this is too good. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4939.0s)]
*  Like something is off here. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4943.0s)]
*  Like this doesn't make sense for any, like generally anything has like more side effects than this shit that they gave whoever she was. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4945.0s)]
*  I wish I could remember her name. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4954.0s)]
*  But the point is, man, like to imagine that stopped. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4955.0s)]
*  Imagine like that was the only time that's happened and that will never happen again with pharmaceutical companies is really crazy. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4959.0s)]
*  Well, it's really crazy that all it took was the pandemic for people to think that way. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4967.0s)]
*  But the problem is the way you think about it with the information that you have about thalidomide and with the information you have about the opioid crisis and the Sacklers. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4971.0s)]
*  The Sacklers. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4982.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4983.0s)]
*  They just, you know, they just got immunity for like, they gave up immunity for like six billion dollars. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4984.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4988.0s)]
*  They bribed. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4989.0s)]
*  Yeah, they bribed. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4990.0s)]
*  They bought their immunity. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4991.0s)]
*  I mean, they lied. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4992.0s)]
*  The companies they owned lied. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4993.0s)]
*  They got people addicted. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4995.0s)]
*  They lost lives. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4996.0s)]
*  So many lost lives. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4997.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4998.0s)]
*  So many lost lives. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=4999.0s)]
*  Vioxx, the Vioxx scandal. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5000.0s)]
*  They killed 60,000, 50, 60,000 people in America. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5002.0s)]
*  Same with thalidomide, by the way. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5007.0s)]
*  Apparently no one went to jail for that shit. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5008.0s)]
*  Like nobody went to jail. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5010.0s)]
*  But the thing is, that's how that business is. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5012.0s)]
*  That business has always been like that. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5015.0s)]
*  And we're one of two countries in the whole planet Earth that allows them to advertise. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5017.0s)]
*  Those commercials are so weird, Joe. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5021.0s)]
*  They're psyops. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5023.0s)]
*  Every commercial is a psyop. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5024.0s)]
*  Every commercial makes you think that you're going to be at that barbecue. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5026.0s)]
*  You're like, I don't have any friends, but if I take this, I'll be laughing and I'll be on that raft with everybody else going down the river, having a good old time. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5028.0s)]
*  That's what I need. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5037.0s)]
*  Oh, who's it back? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5038.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5040.0s)]
*  I can't get that song out of my head. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5041.0s)]
*  Really, all we needed was a little fucking electric pad on each ear. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5042.0s)]
*  I'm better now. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5046.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5050.0s)]
*  Or some psilocybin or exercise or all of the above. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5051.0s)]
*  Except for the electric shock. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5055.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5056.0s)]
*  They shouldn't be allowed to advertise and they should not be allowed to have any lobbyists affecting our government. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5057.0s)]
*  And the amount of money they're making right now, bro. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5065.0s)]
*  They want to keep making that money. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5067.0s)]
*  That's the thing about money. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5069.0s)]
*  When a corporation has growth, when they have massive growth, like these pharmaceutical drug corporations had when they were manufacturing a medication that everybody had to take, when they make that money and then it's over, they don't want to go back to 2018 levels. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5070.0s)]
*  Fuck that. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5086.0s)]
*  You can't. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5087.0s)]
*  We've got to figure out a way to sell more. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5088.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5090.0s)]
*  Or come up with some new thing. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5091.0s)]
*  And I think when you get in those corporations, when you're working in them, it's a filter bubble. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5093.0s)]
*  So like, you know, if you look at corporations as cults, you know, there's a cult-like aspect to corporations. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5098.0s)]
*  So you get into the cult and then over time you get indoctrinated into like resonating with whatever their particular version of reality, whatever their reality tunnel is. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5104.0s)]
*  And so I think in that reality tunnel, they truly believe that everything they're doing makes sense, that it's good to do, that it's all justified. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5115.0s)]
*  Because some of them when confronted, they seem authentically shocked. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5126.0s)]
*  Like they seem like, wait, we're trying to help. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5130.0s)]
*  Like they don't seem to have connected to how weird it is to have that massive a profit margin when it comes to giving people medicine to heal them. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5134.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like the idea being just generally you should not be profiting off of diabetics at the level you are with insulin. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5146.0s)]
*  You know, like generally. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5156.0s)]
*  Selected top diabetes drugs as expected sales in 2020 and 2024. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5158.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5163.0s)]
*  They make a lot of money on diabetes drugs. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5165.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5166.0s)]
*  Authentics included in that. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5167.0s)]
*  So with these diabetes drugs, they make a lot of money off this stuff. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5169.0s)]
*  And if people all got healthy, that would all go away. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5174.0s)]
*  Exactly. So then there's that weird, you know, if you want to sell umbrellas, you need a terrain. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5178.0s)]
*  So then, you know, weirdly, the moment you start making mega profit off of people's sickness, you have an like under the surface of everything, you need people to be sick to continue to take those great fucking vacations. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5182.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5198.0s)]
*  Like, and so so that's where it gets really creepy, right? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5199.0s)]
*  That's the creepy part, because you need them to be ill. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5202.0s)]
*  You want them to be ill. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5205.0s)]
*  And then, you know, I don't know if you looked up like I don't know the exact amount. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5206.0s)]
*  But apparently there's a huge percentage of money coming into networks from the pharmaceutical companies like that's holding them up, which is why, you know, I guess you could just understand how much money they're getting. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5212.0s)]
*  Just every time you see a pharmaceutical company commercial come on on anything you're watching, make note of that. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5223.0s)]
*  And then you can see how much that programming is being paid for by these companies. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5229.0s)]
*  Dude, that's really spooky, man, because then they become kind of the de facto government. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5237.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5243.0s)]
*  They become sort of like the communications mouth. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5244.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5249.0s)]
*  Of the country. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5250.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5251.0s)]
*  So that's essentially what news anchors are. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5252.0s)]
*  Do you see? [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5255.0s)]
*  Is it true? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5256.0s)]
*  The thing about Anderson Cooper that they're saying that he was given twelve million dollars to promote vaccines. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5257.0s)]
*  Somebody posted that on Twitter. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5264.0s)]
*  Twelve million. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5267.0s)]
*  What? [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5268.0s)]
*  That they gave him twelve million dollars to promote vaccines during the pandemic. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5269.0s)]
*  That's definitely reshaping everything. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5272.0s)]
*  His contract is for twelve million a year. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5275.0s)]
*  So that's just his contract with CNN. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5277.0s)]
*  So why are they saying it like that? [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5279.0s)]
*  Because they want people to repeat it. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5281.0s)]
*  I think it was like a fairly reputable source, right? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5282.0s)]
*  I mean, I just typed in Anderson Cooper twelve million. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5285.0s)]
*  There's articles from a couple years ago about that's what he reportedly earns. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5287.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5291.0s)]
*  But it says he won't leave his son in his inheritance because he comes from a very rich family. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5292.0s)]
*  Right. But was it twelve million on top of that that they asked him? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5296.0s)]
*  Did you find that? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5301.0s)]
*  To promote vaccines. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5302.0s)]
*  How would someone know that? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5304.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5305.0s)]
*  But maybe they do. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5306.0s)]
*  Maybe they don't. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5307.0s)]
*  But let's find out. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5308.0s)]
*  So it says Anderson Cooper was given twelve million dollars to promote vaccines. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5310.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5315.0s)]
*  There's a website called, it's not a reputable website, that says Pfizer pays millions to [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5316.0s)]
*  CNN for COVID jab promotion, which is like that's. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5320.0s)]
*  Well, they pay for ads. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5323.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5324.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5325.0s)]
*  So that's a slippery way of phrasing things. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5326.0s)]
*  Just like that other stupid fucking headline. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5329.0s)]
*  You can't really. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5331.0s)]
*  What was the other stupid headline again that drove us nuts? [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5332.0s)]
*  Oh, about Al Pacino. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5335.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5337.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5338.0s)]
*  You can't skim. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5339.0s)]
*  How gross is that? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5340.0s)]
*  But that stupid headline was crazy because that made it look like, oh my God, there's [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5341.0s)]
*  money grubbing whore. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5345.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5346.0s)]
*  And he's mad and he got a paternity test. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5347.0s)]
*  He's like, not so. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5349.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5350.0s)]
*  I love it that my loads work. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5351.0s)]
*  Not the time. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5353.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5356.0s)]
*  They, you know, I think that, you know, the issue is, regardless of whether like someone's [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5357.0s)]
*  getting someone a check or whether or not it's just is in your paycheck from the company [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5364.0s)]
*  that's getting checks. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5369.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5370.64s)]
*  From another place. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5371.64s)]
*  It's just like, it's adding this like extra. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5373.4s)]
*  It's like the people who put their money in the Cayman Islands or whatever. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5375.72s)]
*  It's like adding this extra layer to you getting money from those corporations. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5378.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5382.4s)]
*  It's also what they do at firing squads. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5383.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5384.8s)]
*  We only put. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5385.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5386.8s)]
*  There's only so many people have bullets. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5387.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5389.0s)]
*  If you want to ignore the reality that some of the journalism you're doing is like being [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5391.0s)]
*  warped a little bit by the network potentially. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5398.64s)]
*  I don't know if this happens. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5400.84s)]
*  I'm guessing it does to Matt. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5401.92s)]
*  It probably doesn't. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5404.48s)]
*  Dude. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5406.44s)]
*  Maybe doesn't. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5407.44s)]
*  Man, I've, you know, I'm a little stoned right now. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5408.44s)]
*  I get it. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5411.08s)]
*  But, you know, it creates this ability for you to sort of like cope with that cognitive [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5412.08s)]
*  dissonance. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5416.96s)]
*  You don't have to like go home and think, am I really a journalist? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5418.2s)]
*  I think this is what you might have seen. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5421.8s)]
*  Breaking. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5423.52s)]
*  Robert Kennedy Jr. claims that 80% of Anderson Cooper's $12 million salary comes from Pfizer. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5424.52s)]
*  I read an article that was saying that he was, I couldn't, can't find the interview [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5429.84s)]
*  yet, but in an interview he said that he, that 10 million of that 12 is coming directly [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5433.24s)]
*  from Pfizer and he's promoting it separately. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5437.06s)]
*  But I don't know where he got that information from. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5439.12s)]
*  Can you find what percentage of advertising dollars for seen incomes from pharmaceutical [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5442.0s)]
*  companies? [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5447.719999999999s)]
*  Not CNN specifically, but in that same article I was seeing with this, he makes the claim, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5448.719999999999s)]
*  which we've read before, is that 75% of advertising revenues in the mainstream media comes from [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5451.04s)]
*  that. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5456.0s)]
*  But I just found an article from 20, or last month, February, it says at least for TV [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5457.0s)]
*  that's down, but it's because they're changing the spending to digital buys. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5461.879999999999s)]
*  So you see they fired the CNN guy, the top guy again. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5465.16s)]
*  Who? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5469.0s)]
*  The guy has only been there for a year. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5470.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5471.719999999999s)]
*  My wife was telling me something. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5473.2s)]
*  Because he keeps imploding. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5474.2s)]
*  CNN's imploding. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5475.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5476.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5477.96s)]
*  They just can't seem to get the air back in the tire, can they? [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5478.96s)]
*  They've got a stink on them. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5482.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5483.96s)]
*  Yeah they do. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5484.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5485.96s)]
*  They kept Don Lemon in there too long. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5486.96s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5487.96s)]
*  They kept him in the box too long. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5488.96s)]
*  People didn't like him. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5490.76s)]
*  They felt like he was, you know. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5492.72s)]
*  Naked and afraid, Don Lemon, Tucker Carlson. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5494.96s)]
*  That's the show. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5497.24s)]
*  That's how he comes back. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5498.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5499.24s)]
*  I got my money on Tucker. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5500.24s)]
*  Yeah, well he's like, I don't know if Don Lemon's a fisherman, but I think Carlson's [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5501.24s)]
*  gonna, I bet Carlson will bring a fishing pole. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5506.320000000001s)]
*  You know that you can bring two things or something like that. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5509.2s)]
*  He'll probably bring his fishing pole. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5511.4800000000005s)]
*  What does Lemon bring? [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5513.280000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5514.280000000001s)]
*  Alone would be better. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5515.280000000001s)]
*  Alone is the best. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5516.280000000001s)]

*  I was hooked on that show. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5529.280000000001s)]
*  So fun to sit on your couch like eating and watching these people out there starving in [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5532.76s)]
*  the cold. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5538.400000000001s)]

*  And he was, it was a ringer if there was ever a ringer. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5542.68s)]
*  Because he's lived in Siberia with like the indigenous tribes. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5545.320000000001s)]
*  That's the unfair part of the show. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5550.4400000000005s)]
*  They're putting people like that against like people they found at a bar who are like, I [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5552.4800000000005s)]
*  want to be on TV. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5556.64s)]
*  Or it's just some girl who's hot and wants a lot of like, you know, money for her Instagram. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5557.64s)]
*  They're out in the wilderness for two days and they're like, I have to see my kids. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5563.04s)]
*  They're out. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5567.16s)]
*  But if you want to do a show like that, like you're not going to get that much attention [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5568.28s)]
*  for quitting. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5574.08s)]
*  And there's a lot of money if you win, right? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5576.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5577.719999999999s)]

*  The more episodes you get, the longer these people stay in there, the more episodes you [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5588.68s)]
*  get, right? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5593.04s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5594.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5595.04s)]
*  You want them. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5596.04s)]
*  And they're by themselves filming themselves. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5597.04s)]
*  And the more drama, man, the more views you're going to get. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5598.04s)]
*  So like, you know, they only stop to visit them to give them batteries and shit, right? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5600.76s)]
*  I just, I don't understand the filming process because like I was looking at some of the [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5604.5199999999995s)]
*  shots and it's like, how are they getting these shots? [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5608.32s)]
*  Like, are you, when you're, they set up cameras, they're supposed to, they have a tripod and [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5610.92s)]
*  they're supposed to set up their camera and then like film things. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5614.32s)]
*  So that they're doing certain things. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5617.28s)]
*  It's just all the survival shit to imagine before commencing with your survival activity. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5618.96s)]
*  You're like setting up a GoPro on a tripod. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5624.32s)]
*  Yeah, but hunters do that. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5626.76s)]
*  How does that work? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5627.76s)]
*  Hunters do that all the time. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5628.76s)]
*  Oh, they do? [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5629.76s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know that. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5630.76s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5631.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5632.76s)]
*  They actually have some, they have one that actually is an iPhone. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5633.76s)]
*  Like it's a magnetic thing for your iPhone that sits in your front stabilizer. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5637.8s)]
*  I'm sorry, I forget the name of it, but it's pretty cool. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5642.639999999999s)]
*  So like when you draw your bow back, you can actually press record on your iPhone and film [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5645.0s)]
*  the flight of the arrow with your iPhone. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5651.44s)]
*  That's so cool. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5653.92s)]
*  So you can film the animal coming in, you can film the flight of your arrow. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5654.92s)]
*  And it's actually good for like, for ethical reasons, because you can see whether or not [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5657.88s)]
*  you made a perfect shot. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5662.88s)]
*  And so if you made a perfect shot, just let the animal die and don't freak it out and [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5664.9s)]
*  chase it. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5668.92s)]
*  You see where it goes. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5669.92s)]
*  You could follow the trail because you're visually looking at the film, like you shot [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5671.52s)]
*  off to the right, there he goes. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5675.280000000001s)]
*  And they do that all the time. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5678.160000000001s)]
*  So if you wanted to set up like, people do that all the time in deer hunting, they set [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5679.92s)]
*  up cameras, they have like camera arms, they have on tree stands and shit. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5683.88s)]
*  Have you ever seen those? [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5687.200000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5688.200000000001s)]
*  This whole show is dedicated to whitetail hunting out of a tree stand. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5689.200000000001s)]
*  Like it's like, it is a religion in the Midwest. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5693.68s)]
*  Whitetail hunting? [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5697.040000000001s)]
*  Whitetail hunting is a religion. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5698.040000000001s)]
*  It's the number one hunted animal, big game animal in North America. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5699.92s)]
*  Whitetail deer. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5703.88s)]
*  Dude, people become obsessed with it. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5705.4400000000005s)]
*  They become obsessed to the point where they create habitat for the deer to live. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5709.8s)]
*  Like they buy enormous farms and set up food plots. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5713.04s)]
*  So they're feeding the deer essentially with food. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5716.52s)]
*  They have alfalfa like growing everywhere and the deer just are constantly in their [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5719.4400000000005s)]
*  area eating. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5723.56s)]
*  And then they hide in trees and wait until the wind is right. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5725.08s)]
*  So you don't want like a northeast wind that's like blowing the wrong way so your scent is [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5728.48s)]
*  going all over the field. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5732.639999999999s)]
*  You don't want that. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5734.04s)]
*  So you want to get the right tree stand with the right wind and you sneak in on these animals [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5735.04s)]
*  that have been growing, eating your fucking alfalfa for years and years and years, getting [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5740.44s)]
*  jacked and looking good. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5743.839999999999s)]
*  And all of a sudden one day he's out there eating and thwack! [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5745.44s)]
*  He feels an arrow goes through his rib cage. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5748.5199999999995s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5750.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5751.5599999999995s)]
*  But here's the other ethical dilemma. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5752.5599999999995s)]
*  What? [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5754.24s)]
*  They don't have any predators. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5755.24s)]
*  I mean there's occasional mountain lions. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5756.24s)]
*  There's occasional coyotes. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5758.92s)]
*  How are you keeping these populations down? [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5759.92s)]
*  Because the number of car accidents that people have with deer in like Iowa alone must be [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5760.92s)]
*  off the charts. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5766.639999999999s)]
*  We've done this before right? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5767.639999999999s)]
*  Where we looked at the number of car accidents per year. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5768.639999999999s)]
*  Isn't it like something bonkers? [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5771.24s)]
*  The number of car accidents per year in the United States, it's a crazy number. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5775.44s)]
*  You ever had a deer run in front of your car? [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5779.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5781.16s)]
*  Dude it's so scary. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5782.16s)]
*  It's like they're so fast. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5783.16s)]
*  Oh yeah and they fuck up. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5784.16s)]
*  They make bad choices. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5785.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5786.72s)]
*  Especially when you're around here and it's like November, December, January. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5788.240000000001s)]
*  Be careful because that's when they're horny and that's when they're trying to fuck and [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5794.6s)]
*  they will run right out into traffic. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5797.84s)]
*  And they chase does. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5799.52s)]
*  They're chasing does because they're trying to fuck them and the does don't want to fuck [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5801.400000000001s)]
*  them so the does will run right into traffic. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5803.76s)]
*  Dude. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5805.4800000000005s)]
*  It's a romantic movie. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5806.4800000000005s)]
*  How weird is it that like horniness has the exact same component through all species right? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5807.4800000000005s)]
*  Like a horny human will also run in front of a car. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5813.48s)]
*  Will also do stupid shit. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5817.919999999999s)]
*  It's so weird. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5820.28s)]
*  Like it really makes you dumb when you're horny. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5821.28s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5823.639999999999s)]
*  According to State Farm, between July 21 and June 22 they're down 5.5% from the previous [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5824.639999999999s)]
*  1.9 million animal collisions and 67% of those are deer. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5832.639999999999s)]
*  202 deaths. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5837.24s)]
*  So it's like over a million are deer almost. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5838.24s)]
*  Or like probably 1.1 or 2 million. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5839.919999999999s)]
*  Holy shit dude. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5842.599999999999s)]
*  202 people killed by deer. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5844.799999999999s)]
*  That is nuts. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5849.679999999999s)]
*  My friend Cam Haines in his hometown or near his hometown rather, some guy hit a deer with [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5852.08s)]
*  his car and it flew through the air and came through the window and killed the guy behind [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5859.139999999999s)]
*  him. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5863.599999999999s)]

*  Are you liable for that? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5868.36s)]
*  How could you be? [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5869.879999999999s)]
*  Ping pong to deer? [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5871.04s)]
*  I mean I'm sure you're in the conversation because you hit the deer first. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5872.04s)]
*  But you know if you're on the highway and you hit a deer, who's fucking fault is it? [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5877.4800000000005s)]

*  What state do you think is number one? [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5885.36s)]
*  For getting animals hit? [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5888.28s)]
*  Well you have to think of cars driving a lot through interstates. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5891.400000000001s)]
*  Kansas? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5897.4400000000005s)]

*  They must be infested in those hills up there. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5910.5599999999995s)]
*  And then Montana. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5912.719999999999s)]
*  Montana is number two? [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5913.719999999999s)]

*  I'm going to start taking yoga again. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5941.72s)]
*  I'm going to find a yoga class. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5943.36s)]
*  And then fucking deer through the face. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5945.4s)]
*  Look at that dude. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5949.8s)]
*  That's so fucked up. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5950.8s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5953.92s)]
*  A lot of times when they come through their guts come through too. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5954.96s)]
*  So it's not just a deer that comes through. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5958.68s)]
*  It's like you hit it and then it goes through your windshield and when it goes through your [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5961.34s)]
*  windshield you're just covered in gore. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5965.36s)]
*  Covered in gore. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5968.08s)]
*  And you know what okay so like if we found some statistic for how many nighttime hand [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5969.64s)]
*  jobs happen in Ohio when people are driving. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5975.24s)]
*  Where they get hit by a deer? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5979.04s)]
*  I'm telling you a few people are probably. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5980.32s)]
*  Why do you say hand jobs? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5982.4800000000005s)]
*  What about head? [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5983.4800000000005s)]
*  You know what? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5984.48s)]
*  You got me. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5987.48s)]
*  You kind of like. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5989.48s)]
*  That's more exciting anyway. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5990.48s)]
*  I've gotten more car hand jobs than car blow jobs. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5991.48s)]
*  Yeah I've only gotten a couple of car blow jobs in a lifetime. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5995.599999999999s)]
*  It's a dangerous operation. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5998.48s)]
*  I don't like it. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=5999.759999999999s)]
*  It's not for everybody. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6000.759999999999s)]
*  And it's definitely when you're done you're like what the fuck is wrong with me. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6001.759999999999s)]
*  Because like if you wreck they could accidentally clench their teeth. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6005.879999999999s)]
*  Well yeah also you could wreck. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6009.879999999999s)]
*  Like you're not paying attention you could hit someone. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6012.96s)]
*  Like you fucking selfish prick. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6014.96s)]
*  Like I just got to bite my dick. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6016.96s)]
*  Like oh my god. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6022.96s)]
*  Well look man it's just like. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6023.96s)]
*  It's just pay attention you're not supposed to look at your phone while you're driving. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6025.56s)]
*  You shouldn't be getting your dick sucked. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6027.76s)]
*  You should not be getting your dick sucked. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6029.360000000001s)]
*  Don't look at your phone and don't suck. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6030.76s)]
*  Get your dick sucked. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6032.76s)]
*  And don't suck anybody's dick either. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6033.76s)]
*  We're getting old. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6035.76s)]
*  I know what it's telling people. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6037.76s)]
*  Don't drink. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6039.76s)]
*  Don't drink and don't give car blow jobs. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6040.76s)]
*  What are we turned into. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6042.76s)]
*  What are we turned into. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6044.76s)]
*  Santa Claus is a Psy Up. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6045.76s)]
*  Yeah Santa Claus is fake. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6047.76s)]
*  UFO is probably real. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6049.76s)]
*  How about that. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6051.76s)]
*  How about that man. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6053.76s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6055.76s)]
*  That guy was talking when he was explaining that we've retrieved vehicles of non-human origin. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6056.76s)]
*  And pilots. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6062.76s)]
*  And pilots. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6064.76s)]
*  Dude. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6065.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6066.76s)]
*  Pilots. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6067.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6068.76s)]
*  Astounding. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6069.76s)]
*  Military whistleblower claims US has UFO retrieval program. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6070.76s)]
*  Air Force veteran David Grush claims the government is covering up UFOs. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6075.76s)]
*  Grush claims he has seen evidence of a secret crash retrieval program. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6079.76s)]
*  He alleges the US has even retrieved bodies from other species. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6083.76s)]
*  That lady looks like an alien. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6087.76s)]
*  A little bit like a hot older alien. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6089.76s)]
*  She wants to tell you that you're making big mistakes Duncan. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6091.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6094.76s)]
*  You're making mistakes. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6095.76s)]
*  You've come to Alpha Centiculi with me. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6096.76s)]
*  That would be wild if aliens look like her. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6098.76s)]
*  But if you have like a hot Sigourney Weaver in her prime alien that comes to visit you. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6100.76s)]
*  Please that would be the best. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6106.76s)]
*  Like Sigourney Weaver from Alien. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6108.76s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6110.76s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6111.76s)]
*  You know people don't talk about that when they talk about like female heroes of major blockbuster films. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6112.76s)]
*  Like that's the big one. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6120.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6124.76s)]
*  Sigourney Weaver in Alien. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6125.76s)]
*  That's the big one. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6127.76s)]
*  Because you believe every second of it. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6128.76s)]
*  It is completely inconsequential that she's a woman in that movie. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6131.76s)]
*  That's Aliens. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6135.76s)]
*  It starts getting sketchy. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6136.76s)]
*  I like Aliens. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6138.76s)]
*  Aliens is cool. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6139.76s)]
*  Here's the problem with Aliens. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6140.76s)]
*  Why are they so hard to kill in Alien but so easy to kill in Aliens? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6142.76s)]
*  They got better weapons. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6147.76s)]
*  And then the big mama can't deal with the fucking slow moving mechanical robots. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6148.76s)]
*  You're right. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6154.76s)]
*  Fuck out of here. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6155.76s)]
*  You're totally right. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6156.76s)]
*  Fuck out of here. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6157.76s)]
*  The first thing was like indestructible. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6158.76s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6161.76s)]
*  Clever. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6162.76s)]
*  There was no hope. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6163.76s)]
*  Clever. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6164.76s)]
*  It was like just the opposite of humanity. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6165.76s)]
*  It hid in the escape capsule. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6168.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6170.76s)]
*  Brilliant. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6171.76s)]
*  Remember she has to kill it and shoot it out into space? [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6172.76s)]
*  Bro. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6175.76s)]
*  Have you heard? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6176.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6177.76s)]
*  Here is a nerdy breakdown of Alien that I heard which is really interesting which is [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6178.76s)]
*  horror movies, I think this is like Robert McKee, he teaches about writing scripts. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6183.76s)]
*  Horror movies follow this very predictable pattern and there are all these things that [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6189.76s)]
*  are across the board in horror movies and one of them is you can't call your mom. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6196.76s)]
*  So what was the name of the ship in Alien? [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6202.76s)]
*  Mother. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6206.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6207.76s)]
*  There's all these recurring archetypical things that pop up in horror movies that freak people [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6209.76s)]
*  out. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6214.76s)]
*  Big one is you can't call mommy anymore. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6215.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6217.76s)]
*  So you kind of get that in there. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6218.76s)]
*  It's so creepy. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6220.76s)]
*  It's so creepy that we're at this time where all this UFO information is coming out but [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6225.76s)]
*  yet people are still very reluctant to buy into it or even give it attention. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6233.76s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6237.76s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6238.76s)]
*  People are like, can't be bothered. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6239.76s)]
*  Dude. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6241.76s)]
*  Can't be bothered. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6242.76s)]
*  Listen, because I'm obsessed with it, it's the reaction when you start telling someone, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6243.76s)]
*  there's now seemingly credible evidence that we have alien spaceships and to watch them [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6251.76s)]
*  and be like, yeah, okay. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6259.76s)]
*  It's so weird, dude. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6262.76s)]
*  And it's so weird that now it's getting picked up by the mainstream media but there was this [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6263.76s)]
*  insane pause. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6270.76s)]
*  And no one was taught. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6272.76s)]
*  It went nowhere. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6274.76s)]
*  And this should, isn't this, if this is true, the most astounding thing in human history? [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6276.76s)]
*  It's the most astounding thing. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6286.76s)]
*  It's the most astounding thing because it's the thing that everybody has always wondered, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6288.76s)]
*  are we alone? [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6292.76s)]
*  Not only are we not alone but some people know we're not alone and they're not sharing [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6294.76s)]
*  it with everybody else because they want to profit. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6299.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6302.76s)]
*  Because they want to back engineer these things because they want it for national security [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6303.76s)]
*  reasons, because they want to protect us from the possibility that China gets this technology [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6307.76s)]
*  or Russia gets this technology and then everybody has spaceships. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6312.76s)]
*  But you're not the decider. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6316.76s)]
*  You don't get to decide whether or not human beings go from cradle to the grave without [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6320.76s)]
*  information that you have that would literally change the way we think about the universe [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6325.76s)]
*  itself. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6331.76s)]
*  Like for you to hold on to that because you want to win, get the fuck out of here. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6332.76s)]
*  And if that's really, if some sort of defense contractors are actually involved in this, [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6338.76s)]
*  I mean they can't, look, I don't know anything about what I'm talking about. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6344.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6351.76s)]
*  But when you say the government, oh the government's back engineering UFOs, when you say the government's [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6352.76s)]
*  building secret hypersonic ships that defy visual, you can't take photos of them, you [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6358.76s)]
*  can't take videos of them, they fly through the sky at insane rates of speed, who's making [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6368.76s)]
*  that? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6373.76s)]
*  It's not them. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6374.76s)]
*  What do you mean the government? [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6375.76s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6376.76s)]
*  They don't have the capability to construct those things, you have to go to defense contractors. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6377.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6379.76s)]
*  You have to go to the people that make those things. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6380.76s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6381.76s)]
*  Like buddy, why you got to do it by yourself? [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6382.76s)]
*  Listen, I know you don't trust us because we're not the government, but listen, we work [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6384.76s)]
*  together here. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6389.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6390.76s)]
*  We're going to shut the fuck up too. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6391.76s)]
*  Everybody will shut the fuck up. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6392.76s)]
*  We're going to make this thing. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6393.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6394.76s)]
*  Come on, you're going to fuck it up and then China's going to win. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6395.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6396.76s)]
*  Like, yeah, you got a good point, got a good point guys. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6397.76s)]
*  Let's all get together. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6400.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6401.76s)]
*  Imagine if you make a spaceship from another planet. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6402.76s)]
*  I do not think that if you're actively trying to back engineer that thing, that you're not [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6405.76s)]
*  going to involve defense contractors. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6411.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6412.96s)]
*  You're not going to involve people that make jets. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6413.96s)]
*  You're not going to bring them in? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6419.16s)]
*  No, you have to. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6420.16s)]
*  Of course. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6421.16s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6422.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6423.16s)]
*  So then it becomes a thing with them. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6424.16s)]
*  Imagine them holding onto that. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6428.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6429.6s)]
*  That's their, this is their responsibility. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6430.6s)]
*  Like we have the information that would literally change mankind. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6432.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6434.4400000000005s)]
*  I have to lie to my mom. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6435.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, you're sitting there having a whiskey with the guys after work. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6436.4400000000005s)]
*  I got to lie to my mom. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6439.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6440.52s)]
*  My mom wants to believe that aliens are real. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6441.52s)]
*  I'm like, come on, mom, it's all bullshit. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6442.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, I'm looking at alien spacecrafts seven days a week. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6444.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6448.92s)]
*  Like, what are we doing, guys? [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6449.92s)]
*  And all the implications of that. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6451.04s)]
*  Like the spaceships are the tip of the fucking iceberg. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6452.92s)]
*  Like we don't know motivation. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6457.6s)]
*  Like, you know, assuming all of this stuff is real. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6461.2s)]
*  Now the question is, well, what are they, what do they fucking want? [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6465.08s)]
*  Well, there's all this talk of multiple species too. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6467.799999999999s)]
*  So when we say they, it's like, which ones are we talking about? [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6470.5199999999995s)]
*  Because if you want to go into the motherfucking rabbit hole, right, if you're going to go [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6474.32s)]
*  deep in the rabbit hole, they, there's multiple things. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6478.839999999999s)]
*  There's like the grays that everybody talks about. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6482.4s)]
*  And then there's another thing called the tall whites. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6485.839999999999s)]
*  People have described them. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6488.8s)]
*  They almost look like Scandinavian or something like that, like pale skin. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6490.200000000001s)]
*  Are these the Nords? [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6495.120000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6496.400000000001s)]
*  OK, yeah. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6497.04s)]
*  That's and they think that there's different like some alien life is probably, you know, [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6498.160000000001s)]
*  100,000 years ahead of us, 700,000 years ahead of us, a million years ahead of us. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6507.120000000001s)]
*  But some alien life is probably millions and millions of years ahead of us. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6512.4800000000005s)]
*  They probably don't want to fuck with us anymore. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6517.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6519.44s)]
*  But I bet the intermediate classes, the I bet they're like the watchdogs for the universe [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6519.839999999999s)]
*  to make sure that intelligence reaches that crescendo, that it reaches that that moment [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6525.36s)]
*  where you can join the intergalactic hive of minds, the moment where all the barbaric [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6530.839999999999s)]
*  instincts of our primate DNA are expunged. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6539.24s)]
*  We don't have any of that anymore. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6543.0s)]
*  And the civilization reaches some insane harmony with the very universe itself. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6544.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6549.6s)]
*  That's probably where it goes if you don't blow yourself up. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6551.12s)]
*  But I think any time there's a hiccup, we go way back to as barbaric as possible and [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6556.08s)]
*  it takes forever for things to relax. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6562.16s)]
*  And you're seeing a microcosm of that with covid. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6564.96s)]
*  It's what's accelerated all these different social movements. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6568.88s)]
*  It's what's accelerated all these different people that are what they would call activists. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6573.44s)]
*  It's accelerated all this. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6578.24s)]
*  It's just an insane pause in civilization. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6580.48s)]
*  And then then there's this sort of rapid desire to claim ground and to reformulate and [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6586.08s)]
*  re-change and reimagine and restructure. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6594.32s)]
*  And the government's going to try to get involved and social groups are going to try to get [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6597.5199999999995s)]
*  involved. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6600.96s)]
*  There's a money grab. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6601.28s)]
*  And then there's donations and you find out that some of the people that are involved [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6602.72s)]
*  in the organization are buying mansions. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6605.280000000001s)]
*  And like, don't worry about this mansion. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6607.12s)]
*  I'm out here doing good work. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6608.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6609.4400000000005s)]
*  And then there's so much of that. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6609.84s)]
*  But I think that's a microcosm of what probably happened when the fucking asteroid slammed [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6612.88s)]
*  into us. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6619.92s)]
*  I think when civilization got wiped out, I really believe that it was the worst of the [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6620.96s)]
*  worst. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6627.280000000001s)]
*  And that's why we have such horrible instincts. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6628.16s)]
*  I think we're just not far enough removed from that to get it like strung out of your [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6630.96s)]
*  DNA. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6637.36s)]
*  If you look at like Pinker's work, if you look at any of these people that are studying [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6638.88s)]
*  crime and violence over time, like if you just, I know about anecdotal experiences, [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6642.72s)]
*  I know about your own personal life, but you've got to set that aside for a moment and just [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6648.0s)]
*  look at overall. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6652.4s)]
*  It's getting lower and lower all the time. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6654.56s)]
*  It's always going lower. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6656.8s)]
*  Except for like weird blips and war, it's always going lower. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6658.4800000000005s)]
*  Less crime. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6663.52s)]
*  We're trying to figure it out. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6664.64s)]
*  But if something goes fucking psycho, like shaboom, if Putin says, fuck you, if Putin [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6665.6s)]
*  really does have cancer and just fucking America. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6671.84s)]
*  Classes. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6674.24s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6674.96s)]
*  And then we go back to the worst of the worst. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6675.84s)]
*  And it takes a long, long, long, long time to get to where we are now. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6679.4400000000005s)]
*  It takes 10,000 years. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6686.4s)]
*  It takes 10,000 years to get to the place that we've claimed right now. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6688.96s)]
*  And we can stop this in its tracks. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6693.28s)]
*  It is possible. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6696.48s)]
*  Like the forces that are moving this country in the wrong direction, this terrifying [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6698.32s)]
*  direction, they have power because we've voted them in. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6702.96s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6708.48s)]
*  And if you don't vote them in anymore and then the person you vote in has courage, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6709.599999999999s)]
*  things can change. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6714.32s)]
*  And if people demand it, things can change. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6715.5199999999995s)]
*  But they have to fucking demand it. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6718.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6719.84s)]
*  So then they have to pay attention. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6720.4s)]
*  And that's a problem. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6721.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6722.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6723.44s)]
*  Because you get headlines like that. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6723.92s)]
*  You get headlines like that fucking Al Pacino thing. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6725.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6728.719999999999s)]
*  They're just a lion. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6729.2s)]
*  They're just trying to get clicks. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6729.92s)]
*  That's why CNN is dangerous. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6731.36s)]
*  That's why CNN is dangerous. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6733.36s)]
*  Because CNN, with their biased reporting, the way they communicate things, people [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6734.96s)]
*  don't trust the news anymore. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6740.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6742.48s)]
*  That's what freaks people out now. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6743.04s)]
*  Okay. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6745.04s)]
*  They don't know who to trust anymore. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6745.599999999999s)]
*  So there's this chaos state where people are very uncertain about sources of information. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6747.2s)]
*  And you know what? [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6753.04s)]
*  I must say that is a good thing. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6754.0s)]
*  Like I think that the weird voodoo that has fallen upon so many people, believing that [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6756.4s)]
*  what's in your phone, what you're looking at, is a reflection of truth, is really, really [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6765.04s)]
*  bad. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6771.68s)]
*  The problem is that sometimes it is. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6773.120000000001s)]
*  Well yeah. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6775.120000000001s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6775.76s)]
*  The job is you have to discern one from the other. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6777.4400000000005s)]
*  The idea with educating people wasn't like teach them how to do fucking algebra. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6780.56s)]
*  It was like teach them how to be rational, separate truth from non-truth, because the [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6785.6s)]
*  moment people are incapable of doing that, then they become susceptible to con artistry [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6790.88s)]
*  at the highest level. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6795.76s)]
*  And the moment that happens, you get all the awful events that have happened throughout [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6796.72s)]
*  history. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6800.320000000001s)]
*  So the problem is, man, this replication of reality. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6801.84s)]
*  We're getting secondhand, no matter what it is, if you're watching TV or you're looking [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6807.2s)]
*  at your phone or whatever, you're getting secondhand digitized reality. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6811.44s)]
*  You've taken fundamental truth, which is nature, and you've converted into some kind of warped [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6815.44s)]
*  digital representation of it. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6822.4800000000005s)]
*  And so the more you are sort of harmonizing with that, the less you're harmonizing with [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6824.64s)]
*  just basic fundamental truth. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6829.92s)]
*  You go outside, you look at the trees, you hear the birds, you know what season it is. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6831.76s)]
*  That's real. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6838.4s)]
*  That's not misinformation. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6839.68s)]
*  That's just fundamentally true. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6840.96s)]
*  But we've become separated from that by many, many layers of bullshit. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6843.6s)]
*  And you're right. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6848.72s)]
*  And so now what do we have? [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6849.36s)]
*  We have people who are terrified. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6850.64s)]
*  Have you heard the term fear American? [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6853.84s)]
*  Fear American? [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6856.4s)]
*  No. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6857.04s)]
*  Yeah, like Americans go to other countries and they're all fucking freaked out. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6857.68s)]
*  And just completely anxiety ridden because of the connection to world events or a reality [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6862.16s)]
*  tunnel that's being presented to them by wizards who are getting gold from the alchemists. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6870.64s)]
*  That's basically what's happening is the Alchemy Guild is paying the media wizards and the media [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6879.04s)]
*  wizards are like casting a spell on everyone to believe this very specific reality tunnel [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6884.24s)]
*  that is not real. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6890.5599999999995s)]
*  And if it is temporary, the very best is temporarily real. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6892.32s)]
*  But it's warped. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6895.92s)]
*  It's just slightly distorted. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6897.5199999999995s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6899.28s)]
*  It's like something in there is true, but it's been distorted in this bizarre way by [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6900.0s)]
*  the media wizards. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6904.719999999999s)]
*  And now everyone has like lost track of the basic human ability that has to be cultivated [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6905.84s)]
*  to detect bullshit. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6913.2s)]
*  Like you need to grow that in yourself. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6914.639999999999s)]
*  You need to be able to look at anything and think, I don't think this is true. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6916.5599999999995s)]
*  Where did this come from? [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6920.24s)]
*  Every time something pops up, you're very good about it on your podcast, by the way. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6922.32s)]
*  You like point it out, like, wait, what did you say? [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6926.08s)]
*  And then you look it up. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6928.96s)]
*  And then if it's not true, you admit you were hoodwinked. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6930.16s)]
*  But that's not happening with most people. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6935.2s)]
*  They're just reading the fucking thing and they're not researching it. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6937.5199999999995s)]
*  And my God, that is how you get pickpocketed, man. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6940.72s)]
*  That's like the worst predicament to find yourself in. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6947.360000000001s)]
*  That's such a great way of pointing it out. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6950.64s)]
*  That's exactly what it's like. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6952.320000000001s)]
*  You're being mentally pickpocketed. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6953.6s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6955.12s)]
*  And you're being like warped and manipulated. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6955.84s)]
*  In social psychology, one of the weird problems of having a human brain is we remember information. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6959.2s)]
*  We don't remember the source. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6965.6s)]
*  So if I could just give you some bullshit information, you will forget I told it to you [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6967.280000000001s)]
*  in a hot tub when my eyes were dilated and I was just rambling about something. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6973.68s)]
*  You might accidentally remember that truth is truth because you forgot the source. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6979.280000000001s)]
*  And so your brain spits it out. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6984.88s)]
*  It's like, yeah, this is reality. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6986.240000000001s)]
*  You don't know that that got implanted into you by someone who wanted you to buy shit. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6987.76s)]
*  What a great rant. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=6996.64s)]
*  Sorry, man. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7001.04s)]
*  That was amazing. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7001.52s)]
*  Do you have snot coming out of my nose? [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7002.72s)]
*  Can you see? [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7004.4800000000005s)]
*  No, I don't see anything. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7004.96s)]
*  Okay, good. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7005.92s)]
*  Need a tissue? [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7006.4800000000005s)]
*  No, it's gone. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7007.52s)]
*  I just was getting erotic about it. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7008.320000000001s)]
*  You don't want to be rambling about fucking aliens and pharmaceutical companies with the nasty fucking- [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7009.6s)]
*  That just makes you more human, Duncan. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7015.04s)]
*  I hope I am. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7018.08s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like it's all like a real example of why we need regulation in that regard. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7019.92s)]
*  Like you need a government oversight that is completely objective, that's not influenced by money, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7029.5199999999995s)]
*  that decides what people can and can't say. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7036.56s)]
*  What are the odds? [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7039.44s)]
*  Like, let's just get crazy. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7040.24s)]
*  Like if CNN is the news, what are the odds that CNN would publish an honest [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7041.5199999999995s)]
*  investigative discovery into vaccine injuries? [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7048.0s)]
*  It would be amazing if they did. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7053.12s)]
*  I mean, if they- [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7054.8s)]
*  Could you imagine them being able to do that? [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7055.2s)]
*  I could see in a strategy meeting, as they're trying to like get the network back up to snuff, [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7058.16s)]
*  somebody being like, what if we do this? [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7065.28s)]
*  And then there's money involved. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7067.04s)]
*  And then I could see suddenly like maybe at some point- [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7068.24s)]
*  But the money involved is from the ads. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7071.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7074.0s)]
*  It would have to go subscription based or something. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7075.2s)]
*  You have to go back to CNN Plus. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7078.080000000001s)]
*  We're reviving CNN Plus to do real journalism. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7079.6s)]
*  I loved CNN Plus. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7082.160000000001s)]
*  Did you? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7083.360000000001s)]
*  No, I never fucking watched. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7083.76s)]
*  No one has ever said that. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7087.6s)]
*  You're like, Brian Stelter has the best book club. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7088.88s)]
*  CNN Plus definitely like, you know, like at least like the whatever Fox's subsidiary was. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7094.320000000001s)]
*  I think that's still available and works. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7101.280000000001s)]
*  They showed Roseanne Barr's stand-up comedy special on Fox Nation. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7103.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, on Fox Nation. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7106.88s)]
*  Is that what it is? Is it called Fox Nation? [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7108.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Fox Nation. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7109.68s)]
*  And I'll admit, man, I came close to press- [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7111.12s)]
*  Subscribing? [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7113.28s)]
*  Only because like I like to watch lifetime movies. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7114.08s)]
*  Do you ever watch lifetime movies? [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7118.24s)]
*  They don't have them on Fox Nation. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7120.24s)]
*  Please tell me that's not true. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7121.84s)]
*  No, they don't have lifetime movies. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7122.4800000000005s)]
*  But Fox Nation seemed like a lifetime movie because of like, [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7123.6s)]
*  they're like really veering towards like, conservative, hyper-moralistic sort of like- [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7127.04s)]
*  Christian values. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7134.16s)]
*  Christian values. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7134.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7135.92s)]
*  That's the antidote. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7137.04s)]
*  But turning the volume up too high on that creates inadvertent comedy. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7137.759999999999s)]
*  And so like I was like, fuck man, I want to watch that. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7142.32s)]
*  That's going to be really funny to watch. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7145.5199999999995s)]
*  That's a great thing to watch on mushrooms. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7147.84s)]
*  Watch that on mushrooms. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7150.639999999999s)]

*  Very. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7342.8s)]

*  The option is just start telling the truth. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7757.2s)]
*  But that's not going to happen with them. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7760.56s)]
*  So what they want to do is win and they want to stay in power. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7762.96s)]
*  And they can even justify that by saying that we are going to do the overall good. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7766.0s)]
*  We have great ideas about social justice. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7771.84s)]
*  We have great ideas about reshaping the economy and making things more fair. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7774.24s)]
*  And they've got some good points. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7779.12s)]
*  It's not like the liberals don't have things that I agree with. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7782.96s)]
*  I agree with most of what they say. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7786.16s)]
*  Most of the idea, like the civil ideas. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7789.68s)]
*  Like what? [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7792.16s)]
*  Most of the things about equality. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7793.92s)]
*  Most of the things about like the idea that there's like real income inequality in this country. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7796.0s)]
*  It's real. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7802.24s)]
*  And it's kind of creepy. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7803.76s)]
*  And there's a source. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7805.6s)]
*  And the source is opportunity. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7807.12s)]
*  And if we don't create opportunity for these people that live in these horrible places, [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7810.32s)]
*  then we don't give a fuck about them. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7814.88s)]
*  And then if we wonder why there's so much crime, [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7816.4800000000005s)]
*  we wonder why there's so much violence. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7818.4s)]
*  And then you have to wonder, is there an industry that's [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7820.08s)]
*  based around making sure that people stay criminals? [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7824.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, there is. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7826.879999999999s)]
*  It's the prison industrial complex. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7827.759999999999s)]
*  It's a real thing. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7829.599999999999s)]
*  They need prisoners. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7830.639999999999s)]
*  And then you find out that prison guards unions lobbied to keep marijuana illegal. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7831.599999999999s)]
*  You're like, what? [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7836.639999999999s)]
*  Because they want more people in their prison. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7837.5199999999995s)]
*  They want to lock people up so they can make money. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7840.08s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7844.16s)]
*  Vampirism. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7845.92s)]
*  So the liberals are right on a lot of these. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7846.64s)]
*  I just think they're wrong in the approach. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7848.4800000000005s)]
*  I think the approach is not to just exonerate people and let people out of jail [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7850.320000000001s)]
*  and let fucking chaos ensue and defund the police. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7853.6s)]
*  I think the approach is to start dumping money into the cities. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7856.08s)]
*  Start figuring out how to set up community centers. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7860.240000000001s)]
*  Start figuring out how to get people healthy food. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7862.72s)]
*  Start figuring out how to protect people from gang violence. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7864.88s)]
*  In fact, maybe have more police so that the police can prevent people [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7868.400000000001s)]
*  from getting shot and killed so they feel safe in their community. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7872.8s)]
*  But you have to get better police. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7875.76s)]
*  So you need more money for training, more money for funding, more money for salary. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7877.4400000000005s)]
*  And make them feel like a respected, appreciated part of the community [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7881.12s)]
*  and then have oversight over them. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7885.04s)]
*  Make sure that the people that have oversight over them are good people. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7886.72s)]
*  Good people exist. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7889.76s)]
*  They're out there. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7892.0s)]
*  We're mostly good. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7892.72s)]
*  Human beings, I think, are mostly good. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7894.08s)]
*  Fundamentally good. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7897.76s)]
*  But we get covered up by defense mechanisms. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7898.24s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7900.08s)]
*  That fundamental goodness is covered up and warped by defense mechanisms [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7900.72s)]
*  and confused motivations. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7904.4s)]
*  I mean, fuck. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7905.92s)]
*  That's the saddest part is it's like, when you say they want to win, [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7906.96s)]
*  their idea of winning isn't even winning. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7912.08s)]
*  It's just holding power. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7914.24s)]
*  That's not winning. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7915.679999999999s)]
*  That's winning. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7916.48s)]
*  They think it's winning. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7917.12s)]
*  And that's what human beings do. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7918.0s)]
*  We naturally play this game of winner and loser with almost everything. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7920.16s)]
*  That's why neighborhoods, like people try to keep... [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7924.799999999999s)]
*  That's the expression, keeping up with the Joneses. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7927.04s)]
*  They're trying to win. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7929.28s)]
*  You're like, hey, Mike got a Corvette. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7930.639999999999s)]
*  Fuck him. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7932.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7933.36s)]
*  I'm going to get a Ferrari. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7934.16s)]
*  Oh, Mike, how do you like my Ferrari, you piece of shit? [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7935.52s)]
*  It's like classic comedy sitcom tropes. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7939.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7942.0s)]
*  Yeah, that to me is like... [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7942.72s)]
*  You're right. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7944.56s)]
*  I think you're right. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7945.12s)]
*  People want to win, man. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7946.0s)]
*  People want to win. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7946.88s)]
*  And that's why it's dangerous to have cops pull people over. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7947.52s)]
*  There's something about that too. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7951.360000000001s)]
*  You definitely should pull people over because they're bad. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7953.04s)]
*  But cops, they want to fucking... [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7955.4400000000005s)]
*  They want to write tickets. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7957.4400000000005s)]
*  They want to catch people. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7958.88s)]
*  They want to bust people. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7960.400000000001s)]
*  They're supposed to bust people. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7961.76s)]
*  It's the profit motive is fucking everything up. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7962.88s)]
*  But it's also what is creating some of the coolest shit ever. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7965.68s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7969.52s)]
*  It's a double-edged sword. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7970.400000000001s)]
*  On one side, competition creates insane innovation based on market pressure. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7971.84s)]
*  It's incredible. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7977.4400000000005s)]
*  On the other side of it, you get people who shouldn't be millionaires. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7978.16s)]
*  You get people who somehow have overcome their desire to have the next Ferrari [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7983.84s)]
*  and realize, oh, the better thing to do is help. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7989.36s)]
*  I just want to help. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7991.84s)]
*  The idea was it's a public servant, not someone who's manipulating the fucking stock market [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7993.28s)]
*  or selling their shit. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=7999.52s)]
*  That's the problem, man. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8001.2s)]
*  It's really insidious. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8002.400000000001s)]
*  On one side, it's like, all right, so if we regulate it, [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8005.12s)]
*  well, now you've got the hardcore socialism starts happening. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8008.96s)]
*  Now you've got redistribution of wealth. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8012.64s)]
*  Now you're trying to reset the game in the middle of the game. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8014.400000000001s)]
*  And lots of people are like, no, fuck that. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8017.92s)]
*  We're not resetting the game. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8019.6s)]
*  But then on the other side, if you don't do anything about it, [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8021.84s)]
*  then the game takes over everything. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8024.88s)]
*  Government is now no longer a representative government at all. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8028.56s)]
*  It's just a weird bag of greedy miscreants who are all getting various checks from various, [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8033.84s)]
*  sometimes competitive industries and making laws based on that. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8041.76s)]
*  And that's not a government. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8046.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8049.4400000000005s)]
*  That's a casino or something. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8050.4s)]
*  Not just people who got to the high roller table. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8051.839999999999s)]
*  No, it's like people who are like, I'm done gambling. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8056.08s)]
*  I'm going to control the fucking casino. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8058.32s)]
*  Well, that's what people are terrified about with generational wealth. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8059.92s)]
*  That's why people are terrified of very, very wealthy families [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8063.679999999999s)]
*  that have transferred this money down to their children. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8067.36s)]
*  Like the children don't earn it. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8069.759999999999s)]
*  That's the king. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8072.32s)]
*  That's Joffrey. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8073.44s)]
*  Everybody knows what that is. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8076.24s)]
*  That's why Succession is such a good show because you can relate to it. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8077.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8080.639999999999s)]
*  Like what a what fucking bizarre reality do they exist in? [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8080.879999999999s)]
*  Dude, I don't know, but I wish I'd experienced it. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8084.96s)]
*  It looks fucking fun, baby. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8089.04s)]

*  Growing up poor, when I was a young boy, we were drinking like powdered milk [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8188.719999999999s)]
*  and living off welfare, food stamps. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8193.68s)]

*  class suburb so that we could go to a good high school. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8213.6s)]
*  So I saw what hard work and all the thinking that was involved in planning this out properly. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8216.800000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8224.960000000001s)]

*  a latchkey kid. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8239.36s)]

*  I could just like leave and go anywhere. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8243.44s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8245.44s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8246.720000000001s)]

*  Your children will be billionaires. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8270.08s)]

*  They won't. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8288.64s)]
*  There's like extra gears that you have that you're born with when you live in poverty. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8289.76s)]
*  I think that's what you look at all the great athletes, almost all of them, [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8295.44s)]
*  unless they grew up in households that were like very strong households where the father [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8299.2s)]
*  really encouraged athletics and was like really a great coach and the kid like grew up competing [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8302.88s)]

*  That's possible too. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8309.519999999999s)]

*  It's a lot of people. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8316.48s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8467.64s)]
*  Because it's just physics. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8468.039999999999s)]
*  But it can be in anything. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8470.039999999999s)]
*  It could be in disciplines. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8471.16s)]
*  It could be in games they play. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8472.44s)]
*  It could be in sports. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8473.88s)]
*  It can be on a lot of things. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8474.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8480.84s)]

*  And then you gotta be excited about that feeling that you get when you get better at stuff. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8482.84s)]
*  Yes. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8486.84s)]

*  That's it. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8491.0s)]
*  And you start connecting with that feeling as being actual success. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8491.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8495.960000000001s)]
*  That's actual success. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8496.36s)]
*  Whatever else the world gives you is fantastic. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8500.44s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8502.44s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8503.24s)]
*  But if you never had that feeling in a lifetime and you were sleeping on bags of fucking cash, [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8503.64s)]
*  it wouldn't mean anything. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8509.72s)]
*  It wouldn't mean anything. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8510.84s)]

*  That's the weirdness of all of a sudden becoming a part of this hyper wealthy elite. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8515.88s)]
*  And that's the weirdness of anybody's life in North America. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8522.84s)]
*  If you're in North America, first of all, you hit the fucking lottery. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8528.359999999999s)]
*  If you're in the United States, oh shit, you don't even have to get vaccinated. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8532.039999999999s)]
*  If you're in Canada, Canada used to be an awesome spot to live until the lockdowns. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8537.0s)]
*  And it was like, what is happening up there? [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8541.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8544.36s)]
*  What is happening up there? [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8544.76s)]
*  It's like of all the places you would expect to have some encroaching fascism happening. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8547.16s)]
*  Never. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8555.32s)]
*  Never Canada. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8555.88s)]
*  Never my list. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8556.92s)]
*  It's very odd. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8558.44s)]
*  They're doing it under the guise of social justice and it's so creepy. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8559.72s)]
*  But that is how you do it. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8563.64s)]
*  If you want to do fascism, that's how you do it. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8565.32s)]
*  You don't do fascism by saying, hey, I'm going to control the shit out of you motherfuckers. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8567.16s)]
*  You do it by saying, hey, you better watch out because this thing is coming [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8571.32s)]
*  and I'm the only one who can keep you from that thing coming. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8575.8s)]
*  Fill in whatever that thing is. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8578.599999999999s)]
*  Bro, when they lock people out of their bank accounts for protesting, [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8579.96s)]
*  when they had the freedom convoy, they lock people out of their bank accounts. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8582.76s)]
*  They lock people out of their bank accounts that donated. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8586.039999999999s)]
*  Not even that went there, that donated. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8588.92s)]
*  You can't agree with them. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8591.16s)]
*  You can't agree with them. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8592.12s)]

*  So spooky. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8594.6s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8595.400000000001s)]
*  So spooky. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8596.6s)]
*  That's so scary because it sends ripples of fear through everybody. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8597.16s)]
*  And it should. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8601.08s)]
*  It should. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8601.960000000001s)]
*  Just because you think you're doing it for the right reasons. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8602.68s)]
*  That is there's a reason why we are so protective of the Bill of Rights. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8604.68s)]
*  We're so protective of the Constitution. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8610.76s)]
*  If you don't have something like that where it's written down, [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8613.24s)]
*  they just keep pushing the rules. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8616.52s)]
*  Yes. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8619.08s)]
*  They keep changing. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8619.480000000001s)]
*  They're making all these crazy new woke rules in Canada. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8620.44s)]
*  You can't say shit about it. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8624.76s)]
*  There's censorship of everything on the internet that they don't like. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8625.880000000001s)]
*  They could pull things down. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8629.560000000001s)]
*  They can do all kinds of wild shit. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8630.76s)]
*  I don't know about the internet. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8632.36s)]

*  I know they've passed some new censorship legislation. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8636.44s)]
*  I don't think it's the internet. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8640.92s)]
*  I'm exaggerating. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8642.04s)]
*  But what it is is spooky because that guy is like not being honest about what he did during COVID. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8643.08s)]
*  He's saying they never forced anybody to get vaccinated. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8648.2s)]
*  They fucking kind of did. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8650.6s)]
*  You ruined their life if they didn't. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8652.039999999999s)]
*  Censorship bill. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8655.56s)]
*  The bill makes changes to Canada's Broadcasting Act. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8656.28s)]
*  The legislation requires streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8658.36s)]
*  to support Canadian media content like music and TV shows. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8662.76s)]
*  It also requires the platform promote Canadian content. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8668.52s)]
*  Is that it? [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8672.2s)]
*  It doesn't seem to. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8673.72s)]
*  It says regulate though. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8674.36s)]
*  Like what else is in the regulate? [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8676.36s)]
*  You could say that's the good positive spin on it. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8677.96s)]
*  It's a nationalistic effort. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8680.2s)]
*  They want to promote more Canadian content. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8681.8s)]
*  But I know they've had that in the past. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8684.92s)]
*  You know they had that for like radio and for television. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8686.92s)]
*  They had rules up there. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8690.36s)]
*  I remember that because somebody I knew was a DJ up there. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8692.2s)]
*  The bill makes changes to Canada's Broadcasting Act. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8696.68s)]
*  It also requires the platforms to promote Canadian content. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8700.279999999999s)]
*  Specifically the bill says online undertakings shall clearly promote [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8705.88s)]
*  and recommend Canadian programming in both official languages [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8709.8s)]
*  as well as indigenous languages. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8713.08s)]
*  The changes give the Canadian Radio, Television, and Telecommunications Commission, [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8715.16s)]
*  Canada's broadcast regulator, broad powers over digital media companies, [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8719.96s)]
*  including the ability to impose financial penalties for violations of the Act. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8724.76s)]
*  The government says the legislation is necessary to impose the same regulations [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8730.52s)]
*  and requirements in place for traditional broadcasters on online media platforms. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8734.6s)]
*  Right now broadcasters are required to spend at least 30% [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8740.36s)]
*  of their revenue on supporting Canadian content. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8743.72s)]
*  Online streaming has changed how we create, discover, and consume our culture. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8747.800000000001s)]
*  It's time we updated our system to reflect that, [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8752.039999999999s)]
*  a government news release on the bill says. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8755.0s)]
*  That's not good. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8757.8s)]
*  None of that is good. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8758.599999999999s)]
*  Are we or are we not moving to a global entertainment world for the English language? [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8763.32s)]
*  It seems like it's kind of moving in that direction. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8769.16s)]
*  Some of the best podcasts in the world like Trigonometry comes out of the UK. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8772.279999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff out of America that's very popular over there. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8776.439999999999s)]
*  Who gives a shit? [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8779.56s)]
*  If it's Canadian or if it's American, you're going to regulate the internet. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8781.08s)]
*  But to me the real creepy thing is the state is saying what Canadian culture is. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8787.0s)]
*  Culture isn't it supposed to be something that kind of spontaneously emerges from groups of people? [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8795.16s)]
*  But they're not exactly saying that. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8799.960000000001s)]
*  You could look at it in an altruistic way. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8803.0s)]
*  You could say this is promoting Canadian content [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8804.84s)]
*  and it'll encourage more art to be created in Canada. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8807.96s)]
*  You can't regulate that. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8812.599999999999s)]
*  You can't legislate that because you can't give those fuckheads power over creativity. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8813.8s)]
*  You just can't do it. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8817.72s)]
*  You'll ruin it all. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8820.199999999999s)]
*  You'll ruin the internet. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8821.4s)]
*  You'll ruin it all. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8822.439999999999s)]
*  The bill's journey through parliament has been difficult. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8824.92s)]
*  Rodriguez tabled the legislation in the House of Commons on February 2022. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8827.64s)]
*  Nearly a year later, the Senate sent C-11 back to the House of Commons with amendments. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8833.64s)]
*  The House accepted most of the amendments but rejected others. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8838.68s)]
*  So has it passed or not passed? [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8841.56s)]
*  One of the most contentious points of debate is whether C-11 would apply to user-generated content [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8844.68s)]
*  such as podcasts and online videos. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8849.56s)]
*  The government has insisted that the legislation is not intended to regulate [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8851.96s)]
*  independent content creators. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8855.64s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8857.16s)]
*  Not intended is a rough word. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8857.4s)]
*  Not intended is not a good way. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8858.519999999999s)]
*  I don't like that. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8859.96s)]
*  It's not intended but it could be used in that way. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8860.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8862.76s)]
*  They're just going to have more power to tell you what to do. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8863.56s)]
*  And if you're a Canadian person who is broadcasting a podcast out of Vancouver [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8866.039999999999s)]

*  you could run into trouble. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8880.279999999999s)]
*  You could run into trouble. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8881.88s)]
*  You can't have them have any power over the internet. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8883.32s)]
*  No. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8885.64s)]
*  You've got to say no. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8885.88s)]

*  Dude, this is- [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8887.0s)]

*  I'm checking. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8892.039999999999s)]
*  If you subscribe to whatever the particular modality of your government is in regards [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8893.16s)]

*  Damn. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8925.0s)]
*  The problem is- [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8925.24s)]
*  Fucking Canada. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8926.039999999999s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8938.359999999999s)]
*  Secret coups happen, and then all of a sudden, all these rights you gave away, [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8939.48s)]
*  you've given them to the people who you were fighting against. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8944.52s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8965.080000000002s)]

*  and that's what's happening. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8989.48s)]
*  And that's what just happened in Canada. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8990.44s)]
*  Yeah, just a very slow trajectory towards state control. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8991.960000000001s)]
*  It's the fucking internet. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8995.16s)]
*  You can't say that someone has to have 30% Canadian content on the internet. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=8996.68s)]
*  That's bonkers. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9001.32s)]
*  30% on Netflix. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9002.2s)]

*  That's a lot of- [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9005.56s)]
*  Do you know what they're requiring them to do? [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9006.28s)]
*  Maybe they have to spend 30% of their budget to promote it in Canada. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9011.08s)]
*  Fuck out of here. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9016.28s)]

*  You're lying. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9040.039999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9042.359999999999s)]
*  That's pretty much it. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9042.759999999998s)]
*  If you're fucking lying, you need to control [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9043.88s)]
*  people's ability to challenge whatever lie you're telling. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9046.599999999999s)]
*  And the more egregious the lie, theoretically, [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9049.56s)]
*  the more you have to shut any kind of counter-argument down. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9052.199999999999s)]
*  My favorite conspiracy is that he's Castro's kid. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9057.56s)]
*  He does look like him. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9062.039999999999s)]
*  He looks a lot like his dad, too, though. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9063.32s)]
*  I don't think he's Castro's kid. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9065.48s)]
*  The problem is his dad looks like Castro. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9066.199999999999s)]
*  Dude, look- [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9068.44s)]
*  He looks a lot like Castro, though. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9069.72s)]
*  I mean, maybe that's just something that starts- [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9071.64s)]
*  What if that's what happens? [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9073.4s)]
*  Like the more fascist you become, the more your face turns- [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9074.6s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren did. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9076.84s)]
*  It ruined her career. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9078.039999999999s)]
*  You should do it, too. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9079.24s)]
*  Take a DNA test, bro. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9080.92s)]
*  If I was Justin Trudeau, I would do that just to shame all the people who said I was Castro. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9082.68s)]
*  What if it turns out he's 72% Cuban? [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9088.44s)]
*  You won't tell anybody. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9092.039999999999s)]
*  He's probably taking that test. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9093.88s)]
*  He's probably taking that test and called his mom. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9095.96s)]
*  What the fuck? [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9097.8s)]
*  Mom, you know, son, it was a lonely weekend. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9098.76s)]
*  Castro's a wonderful man. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9102.039999999999s)]
*  Kind of cooler, though, right? [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9104.44s)]
*  I like the fucking- [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9106.92s)]
*  Unless you're living under his grip. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9108.039999999999s)]
*  Dude, of course. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9109.88s)]
*  But if you're going to go fascist, put on a costume. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9110.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9114.44s)]
*  I like Castro's. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9114.76s)]
*  I'm wearing fucking camouflage. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9115.64s)]
*  You are not going to mistake me for anything other than an authoritarian leader. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9117.32s)]
*  He dresses exactly the way they- [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9123.64s)]
*  Dresses a military leader. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9125.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9126.6s)]
*  But to me, when fascism becomes insidious, when it learns to disguise itself as the opposite [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9127.08s)]
*  of what it is, oh, dude, that is so spooky. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9136.68s)]
*  That's where it gets really scary. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9140.44s)]
*  They're wolf in sheep's clothing. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9141.960000000001s)]
*  Did you ever see the video where they're asking Trudeau how his family is using recyclables [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9144.6s)]
*  and what are they doing to stop this? [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9151.8s)]
*  Did not see that. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9153.88s)]
*  He's talking about his family drinking water. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9155.16s)]
*  They've switched to bottles of water that are made out of paper, those box bottles of water. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9158.599999999999s)]

*  Forget all the speeches. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9169.72s)]

*  See if you can find that. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9176.039999999999s)]
*  He's having a conversation about box water being- [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9177.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9181.880000000001s)]
*  Put it back from the beginning. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9184.36s)]
*  We have recently switched to drinking water bottles out of water, out of when we have [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9187.24s)]
*  water bottles out of plastic, sorry, away from plastic towards paper. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9193.32s)]
*  It's hard to watch, but hard to look away. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9199.8s)]
*  The prime minister- [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9202.6s)]
*  What the fuck? [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9204.12s)]
*  That's their exceptional leader. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9205.48s)]
*  That's when you catch him answering a question. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9208.039999999999s)]
*  Drink box water bottles sort of things. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9212.28s)]
*  Drink box water bottles. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9215.64s)]
*  Sort of things. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9217.24s)]
*  That's what he's done. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9218.68s)]
*  That's the big contribution. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9219.32s)]
*  I'm sure there's more. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9220.28s)]
*  I'm sure he's done more. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9221.32s)]
*  I'm sure he switched to solar. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9222.2s)]
*  I'm sure he eats organic, whatever. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9223.24s)]
*  But the point is, that's the guy. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9225.32s)]
*  That's the guy that's telling you we have to be able to regulate podcasts. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9227.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9231.24s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9232.2s)]
*  We don't regulate podcasts. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9233.48s)]
*  Someone could play this very clip like you and I are doing from the great state of Texas. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9234.52s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9240.2s)]
*  Where a person could talk shit about someone who should be talked shit about in that regard. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9240.92s)]
*  If you want this to run in Canada, you're going to have to put a Canadian flag up or something. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9245.4s)]
*  I don't think that's going to be the issue. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9250.28s)]
*  I think it's going to be the issue of this 30% thing. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9252.04s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9254.84s)]
*  It's not broadcasting just in Canada. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9258.2s)]
*  30% Canadian guests. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9260.6s)]
*  Spotify Canada only. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9261.8s)]
*  That Spotify Canada only has to stuff itself with 30% Canadian content. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9263.4s)]
*  Maybe they have enough Canadian content already. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9268.92s)]
*  A lot of great stuff comes from Canada. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9271.24s)]
*  I'm sure a lot of great podcasts come from Canada. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9272.84s)]
*  Maybe they already have. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9274.759999999998s)]
*  What's the percentage of podcasts right now that come from Canada? [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9277.24s)]
*  See if we can find that. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9281.0s)]
*  Let's just go to Spotify. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9281.96s)]
*  To say Google what percentage of podcasts come from Canada on Spotify. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9283.72s)]
*  I wonder if it applies to porn. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9292.76s)]
*  Porn sites will have to have 30% Canadian porn. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9295.32s)]
*  Yeah, they have to. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9298.76s)]
*  Rules are rule, bro. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9300.2s)]
*  The government is going to force people to make more Canadian porn. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9301.88s)]
*  That's the problem with shit like that. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9304.6s)]
*  Is it like it gets so absurd when you start unpackaging it and realize all the weird things. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9305.96s)]
*  P.S. who determines what is Canadian content? [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9312.92s)]
*  Let's say it was shot in the United States. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9315.880000000001s)]
*  Harlan Williams is a star. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9318.12s)]

*  This is not. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9325.0s)]
*  What if Americans go to Canada, shoot something. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9325.480000000001s)]
*  Is that Canadian content? [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9328.2s)]
*  How about they just do 30% of their program is Tom Green. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9329.480000000001s)]
*  We're good. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9332.68s)]

*  I know it's a weird Google, but I think. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9356.68s)]
*  That is a weird Google. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9358.28s)]

*  There's a lot of Spotify live on the air. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9362.52s)]
*  What percentage of Canadians listen to podcasts, which is not what I asked. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9364.92s)]
*  Oh. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9368.76s)]
*  That's what I typed in, but that's what Google thinks I'm looking for. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9369.880000000001s)]
*  Because it's a weird question. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9372.84s)]
*  How about what percentage of podcasts are created in Canada? [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9374.6s)]
*  Try that. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9378.6s)]
*  In Canada. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9383.720000000001s)]
*  Maybe create is not the right word. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9385.160000000002s)]
*  It's the same problem. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9386.12s)]
*  It's not. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9387.160000000002s)]

*  So maybe there's a chart out there of podcasts by country. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9389.800000000001s)]
*  That's what I have, but that list, we're number one. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9397.400000000001s)]
*  It's just listing the most popular, the most popular candidate podcast in Canada. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9400.84s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9405.800000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9406.12s)]
*  Not that are just coming from there. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9406.44s)]
*  And within that, you'd have to talk to someone in Canada who's tracking all that information [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9407.800000000001s)]
*  and everyone has to be honest about where they're uploading. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9411.560000000001s)]
*  First of all, shout out to Canada for making me number one. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9414.76s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9417.640000000001s)]
*  I was looking for a Canadian named podcast, but these all just seem like normal. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9418.84s)]
*  Yeah, those are normal on Caller Daddy, Huberman Lab number three. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9423.240000000002s)]
*  Jordan Peterson. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9426.68s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9428.92s)]
*  Pretty similar to the list. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9429.24s)]
*  Damn. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9431.16s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9435.480000000001s)]
*  That must feel good. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9435.960000000001s)]
*  It's fucking weird. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9437.480000000001s)]
*  Tell you that. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9438.44s)]
*  But want some coffee? [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9439.720000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9441.400000000001s)]
*  Thank you, friend. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9443.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9444.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9444.6s)]
*  I try not to. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9445.960000000001s)]
*  The other thing about it is the more you fixate on this. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9447.0s)]
*  Cheers, sir. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9451.800000000001s)]
*  Cheers, my brother. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9452.6s)]
*  Congratulations. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9453.480000000001s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9454.6s)]
*  2,000. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9455.24s)]
*  2,000 episodes. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9456.28s)]
*  The more you fixate on the state, the state is an egregore. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9459.0s)]
*  So the more people that fixate on the thing, the more powerful it grows. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9463.960000000001s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9467.640000000001s)]
*  The more it gets, it likes. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9468.36s)]
*  You know, like people when you realize they are enjoying negative attention? [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9471.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9475.32s)]
*  That's the state. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9476.36s)]
*  It doesn't care what flavor the attention is. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9477.24s)]
*  It just wants attention. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9480.92s)]
*  And the more it gets, the more powerful it gets, the more people believe in it. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9482.6s)]
*  And that's all it can... [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9486.36s)]
*  If you believe it's going to hurt you or if you believe it's going to help you, [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9487.880000000001s)]
*  you're still supporting it. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9491.560000000001s)]
*  You're still bringing it into increasing levels of power. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9493.0s)]
*  So that's the other problem. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9496.68s)]
*  It's like everyone gets all fixated on the government. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9497.560000000001s)]
*  Like that, the news has... [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9500.28s)]
*  Many news stations have just turned into an endless conversation about the government. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9502.6s)]
*  Endless conversation. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9507.800000000001s)]
*  Nothing about like human interaction at the basic neighborhood level. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9509.0s)]
*  Just about like, I don't know how many people are running the show, but not that many. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9514.76s)]
*  And it gives the impression that the state is God. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9519.4s)]
*  Even if it's reacting to like, we got to stop this. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9524.28s)]
*  You're still worshiping it, but with fear instead of like praise. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9527.880000000001s)]
*  You're still making it something incredibly powerful, which I'm not saying it's not. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9531.56s)]
*  But how much of that power is just coming from a general belief in the egregore [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9536.28s)]
*  of whatever the fucking government is. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9541.800000000001s)]
*  Boy, I sure hope I'm using the word egregore right? [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9543.56s)]
*  Because I said it. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9545.64s)]
*  No! [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9546.519999999999s)]
*  Don't Google it! [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9547.4s)]
*  Get it right. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9548.279999999999s)]
*  Get it right. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9548.92s)]
*  Oh, thank you, Jesus. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9549.42s)]
*  You usually get them right. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9550.84s)]
*  But Terrence McKenna had a great quote about that. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9552.279999999999s)]
*  He said, we're doing the man's work for the man. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9554.6s)]
*  That's it. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9558.199999999999s)]
*  That's a lot of it. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9558.92s)]
*  Because they were like, how are you able to do these seminars [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9559.8s)]
*  where you're talking about things that are completely illegal. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9563.96s)]
*  You're talking about these experiences with great detail. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9566.68s)]
*  You're traveling all over the world. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9569.48s)]
*  And he said, first of all, I think to paraphrase him, [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9571.4s)]
*  one of the things was you have to keep it small. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9574.68s)]
*  If you notice, he does these things. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9576.84s)]
*  There's 100 people there, 200 people, a few hundred people. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9578.6s)]
*  It's very small. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9582.12s)]
*  Informal gatherings of people that are like-minded. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9583.880000000001s)]
*  And you keep your circle tight. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9587.56s)]
*  You don't tune in, drop out, all that shit where you're telling everybody to quit school [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9590.12s)]
*  and do ass like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9594.28s)]
*  And that's Ken Kesey. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9596.92s)]

*  Out of their minds. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9604.6s)]
*  And they were reformulating what society would be. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9605.16s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9608.12s)]
*  They're not wrong. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9609.16s)]

*  They weren't wrong. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9612.52s)]
*  We want to think, oh, what they did was wrong. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9613.560000000001s)]
*  No, you live and you die. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9615.24s)]
*  OK? [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9616.52s)]
*  You live and you die. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9617.24s)]
*  And along the way, you have experiences. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9618.52s)]
*  And you are free to go the Mary Prankster route in my world. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9621.16s)]
*  Sure. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9624.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9624.2s)]
*  In my world, you can go ham. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9624.44s)]

*  Don't fuck people over. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9628.6s)]
*  You should all be like the same ethical and moral consideration should apply to all civilizations. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9629.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9635.56s)]
*  But the idea that these people can't just drop out and fucking sell grilled cheese sandwiches [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9636.039999999999s)]
*  at a Grateful Dead concert, like says who? [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9641.24s)]

*  Yeah, they should be able to do whatever they want. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9647.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9648.519999999999s)]
*  And I think one of the things that I feel has come out of the internet is there's more [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9648.84s)]
*  of an understanding of the idea that there's not just one way to live your life. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9653.96s)]
*  There's not just one life. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9658.039999999999s)]
*  This idea of like everyone has to get up at the same time and drive to some place to sit [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9659.8s)]
*  in a room with a fucking computer in front of them, entering information or dealing with [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9666.519999999999s)]
*  whatever the fuck they're doing. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9672.359999999999s)]
*  And they're like, this is the only way to live. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9673.32s)]
*  No, this is a life that we've somehow or another oddly structured. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9675.4s)]
*  And you can participate in it if you like. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9679.72s)]
*  But if you don't, there's other ways to live life. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9682.439999999999s)]
*  And that's real. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9685.8s)]
*  And I'm not saying you should get in a fucking school bus and everybody does acid. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9686.68s)]
*  I am. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9690.2s)]
*  But if you want to, I feel like you should be able to if you're informed, [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9690.92s)]
*  if you really know what you're getting into, if you really understand it. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9696.2s)]
*  What we're scared of is young people getting sucked into cults because that's a great way [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9699.4s)]
*  to get control over people. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9704.76s)]
*  You tell them all to come with you. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9706.36s)]
*  You all do acid in the field and then you don't do acid and you tell these people that [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9708.44s)]
*  you're a god and you know, you fucking freak them out. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9712.12s)]
*  That's the fucking guy that owned the One World Theater. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9715.32s)]
*  Right. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9718.52s)]
*  That's what he was doing. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9719.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9720.28s)]
*  But I don't think he was using acid. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9720.6s)]
*  He was using hypnosis and just gullibility. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9721.880000000001s)]
*  He could have. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9725.48s)]
*  But it was a lot of gullibility. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9726.36s)]
*  It was a lot of like really idealistic young people that just wanted to learn from a real guru. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9727.880000000001s)]
*  We're scared of that because I think there's a natural part of the human brain that was [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9733.800000000001s)]
*  exposed during COVID that also works to get people into cults that human beings like look [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9738.28s)]
*  towards a light to follow. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9744.36s)]
*  We look towards a guiding light. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9746.2s)]
*  We look towards a savior and we want to be right. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9747.800000000001s)]
*  We want to be correct. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9749.800000000001s)]
*  My savior is the real savior. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9751.24s)]
*  My Buddha is the real Buddha. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9752.68s)]

*  I'm sure. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9757.16s)]
*  I don't doubt you're a Buddha. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9758.04s)]
*  I'm joking. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9759.08s)]
*  I'm not saying that for real. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9759.640000000001s)]
*  I know I'm sorry. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9761.08s)]
*  Sorry I interrupted your rant with a shit joke. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9762.6s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9765.24s)]
*  It's a good joke. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9765.480000000001s)]
*  But I think that it's really, really important that we understand that this structure, the [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9766.44s)]
*  way this is all set up, it's all set up by people that didn't have happy lives. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9772.92s)]
*  They didn't enjoy it. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9777.4s)]
*  These people that are telling you you have to do a certain thing and go in a certain way, [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9778.84s)]
*  look at them. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9782.12s)]
*  They look like Lindsey Graham. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9782.52s)]
*  So many of them look so unhealthy and so sad and so just confused as to what this is all about. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9784.28s)]
*  Very few of them have had psychedelic experiences. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9792.44s)]
*  Very few. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9795.960000000001s)]
*  Because if they did, they wouldn't be so sure. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9797.32s)]
*  They wouldn't be able to just keep saying the things the way they're saying them. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9800.36s)]
*  They wouldn't be able to talk the way they're talking. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9804.2s)]
*  They would just be sickened by it all. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9805.880000000001s)]
*  Dude, I don't know. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9808.12s)]
*  I think that's a pretty big assumption. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9809.16s)]
*  I think that assumption, which we've all had, who have benefited from psychedelics, [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9810.52s)]
*  that you get fucking Lindsey Graham, a nice whopping 500 microgram dose of LSD, [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9814.76s)]
*  he's going to come out the other side of that a new Lindsey Graham. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9821.320000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9825.640000000001s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9826.76s)]
*  I'm talking about a camp. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9827.560000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about taking these motherfuckers to a camp in the jungle [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9829.8s)]
*  and dosing them up for a year. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9833.32s)]
*  Fascist rehabilitation camp. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9835.880000000001s)]
*  Fascist rehabilitation camp. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9837.24s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9838.76s)]
*  I'm not talking about one, hey man, I had one bad experience. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9839.56s)]
*  I'll tell you right, I'm right back to the whiskey and I'm ready to kill Russians. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9843.8s)]
*  I got you. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9846.92s)]
*  That's the best money I ever spent. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9847.64s)]
*  You can go right back to that. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9849.4s)]
*  Remember that joke I used to say about DMT? [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9851.16s)]
*  It's like pressing control, alt, delete for your brain. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9853.64s)]
*  When your brain reboots, your desktop is completely empty except for one folder [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9856.12s)]
*  and that folder is labeled my old bullshit. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9860.36s)]
*  You can either decide to open up that folder and go into it [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9863.640000000001s)]
*  and just fall back into your same patterns or you can go, okay, [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9867.400000000001s)]
*  let's look at this thing for what it really is. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9873.08s)]
*  Instead of being caught in these patterns of momentum, [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9875.720000000001s)]
*  of the past and of bizarre group think. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9879.560000000001s)]
*  Proclivities. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9883.480000000001s)]
*  I'm just listening to this audiobook. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9884.92s)]
*  I'm always trying to listen to some audiobook on spirituality. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9887.320000000002s)]
*  It's Pima Chodron's book, newest book about dying. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9890.6s)]
*  Something like How We Live Is How We Die. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9895.400000000001s)]
*  It's a very good book. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9897.400000000001s)]
*  But in this book, they're sort of talking about [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9898.6s)]
*  what happens when you die before your next life. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9902.84s)]
*  Obviously, you're going to have to subscribe to the model for reincarnation for this, [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9906.36s)]
*  but it's really interesting which is what you're talking about, these proclivities. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9910.04s)]
*  Or it's called samsara. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9914.76s)]
*  It's a loop. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9916.28s)]
*  The cycle of suffering. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9916.92s)]
*  The way that you know those people are like, [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9919.640000000001s)]
*  why do I always this always happens to be in a relationship [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9921.400000000001s)]
*  or the thing in your life that keeps repeating. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9924.68s)]
*  This is happening because of your proclivities. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9928.12s)]
*  It's happening because of your attraction to this type of person [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9930.36s)]
*  or this type of situation or this type of job. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9933.320000000002s)]
*  If you look at proclivities, they happen fast. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9936.36s)]
*  Like in any given moment when you're making these decisions, [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9938.68s)]
*  it's not like you're spending a lot of time generally thinking about them. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9941.96s)]
*  It's just spontaneous. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9945.48s)]
*  Like the next word out of your mouth. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9946.839999999998s)]
*  You're not down there like, what do I say next? [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9948.359999999999s)]
*  It's just coming. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9950.919999999998s)]
*  So these are your proclivities. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9951.8s)]
*  And then when you die, those proclivities are what inform your next birth. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9953.4s)]
*  So if you have not gotten past your spontaneous decisions that cause [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9959.32s)]
*  lack of harmony in your life, [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9967.4s)]
*  and then that will be the momentum that carries you into your next birth, [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9969.56s)]
*  which is why in Buddhism, like they you'll hear shit like meditation is [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9974.12s)]
*  like preparing for death or practice of death. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9978.28s)]
*  It's like you're trying to make it so that when you die, [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9980.36s)]
*  and if you die, nothing happens and you're dead forever. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9984.92s)]
*  Congratulations. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9987.0s)]
*  Fuck. Yeah, you're out. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9988.04s)]
*  You did it. You're great. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9989.08s)]
*  But if you die and you keep going and that model is correct, [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9990.36s)]
*  then you don't want to be reactive in between life because you will freak out, [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=9995.96s)]
*  number one, that you're dead and you still have consciousness. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10001.08s)]
*  That's very disturbing for some people who thought that you die forever. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10004.039999999999s)]
*  Now you're like, oh, fuck, I'm still here. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10008.119999999999s)]
*  And then you don't like not having a body anymore. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10010.439999999999s)]
*  You want to get back in a body in the same way. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10013.08s)]
*  So you fucking just you see you just dive into the next life as quick as you can, [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10016.039999999999s)]
*  instead of like having a little bit of like consideration in between, [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10021.08s)]
*  you know, and not just that. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10025.32s)]
*  You're essentially your projections, the proclivities. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10026.6s)]
*  They they become holograms. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10029.56s)]
*  Basically, so in that sense, do you believe in old souls? [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10031.800000000001s)]
*  I believe in momentum. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10036.84s)]
*  I believe that we have one right now. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10038.68s)]
*  Where am I right now is I think that consciousness or awareness, [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10041.08s)]
*  awareness or what's called non conditioned awareness before the overlay. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10045.720000000001s)]
*  I think we all share that consciousness. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10051.56s)]
*  And we're like little ripples in that consciousness. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10053.88s)]
*  And that's our that's our karma ripples in this consciousness that we all share. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10057.88s)]
*  So I think every soul is is out. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10063.0s)]
*  It transcends time like it's all outside of time space. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10067.48s)]
*  But I guess there could be the potential that certain people's like addiction to rippling that [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10072.84s)]
*  to being within the emptiness and having a body and a self and an identity [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10080.839999999998s)]
*  probably keeps them coming back here over and over and over again. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10086.119999999999s)]
*  That's what I would say. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10089.72s)]
*  Again, this is a cause this is a cosmology that is unquantifiable. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10091.08s)]
*  And I don't think it matters necessarily if it's real or not, at least for me. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10096.199999999999s)]
*  I use it as a tool to help give me the motivation to be less of an asshole. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10100.92s)]
*  And also when you're dying and whatever the next life may be for you or nothing, [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10107.64s)]
*  who gives a fuck? [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10112.84s)]
*  It's like you reincarnate in a lifetime. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10113.72s)]
*  Like you have many incarnations in any given human lifetime. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10116.52s)]
*  You will go through so many different phases. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10119.64s)]
*  And the more you gain control of your ability to not react, [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10122.36s)]
*  the more you will inform what you're growing into. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10126.36s)]
*  The more it is a mindful or intentional personal evolution [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10129.0s)]
*  versus a kind of chaotic mutation based on just you instantly doing everything [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10134.12s)]
*  your brain tells you to do exactly in the moment. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10140.68s)]
*  I think that's very accurate. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10145.640000000001s)]
*  That very much resonates with me. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10148.76s)]
*  When you're saying that, I'm like, I see what you're saying. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10151.720000000001s)]
*  Because you kind of are like reincarnated as you develop and grow as a human being. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10154.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10160.2s)]
*  And you have to be. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10161.160000000002s)]
*  Maybe that was like the analogy from the Bible. [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10162.599999999999s)]
*  Maybe that was what that was about. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10164.679999999998s)]
*  What? [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10167.64s)]
*  Like the reincarnation. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10168.199999999999s)]
*  Who knows what the fuck they really meant when they wrote those things. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10170.359999999999s)]
*  It's so hard to tell. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10173.48s)]
*  I think unless you could go back and read, [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10175.8s)]
*  like have you ever read anything that's translated [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10178.199999999999s)]
*  like someone tweets something in Russian? [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10180.759999999998s)]
*  Like there's a lot of MMA fighters. [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10182.679999999998s)]
*  They'll tweet something in Russian and I'll translate it. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10183.96s)]
*  It's a little broken. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10186.919999999998s)]
*  Garbled. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10187.88s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't make total sense because the structure of the language is so different [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10188.439999999999s)]
*  than ours. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10191.88s)]
*  That's the Bible, man. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10193.08s)]
*  If you could translate, first of all, if you could go back to the oldest version they have, [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10195.4s)]
*  which I think the oldest version is the Dead Sea Scrolls. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10201.08s)]
*  That's the oldest version of the stories that wound up in the Bible. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10204.439999999999s)]
*  It's not necessarily the Bible. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10208.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, some stuff in the Dead Sea Scrolls didn't make the cut. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10211.4s)]
*  Like it didn't get in there. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10215.16s)]
*  But a lot of the stories are kind of similar. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10216.519999999999s)]
*  But there's a lot of wild shit in there. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10220.039999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10222.92s)]
*  A lot of wild shit in the Dead Sea Scrolls. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10223.4s)]
*  I know. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10225.96s)]
*  I mean there's a lot of wild shit in the standard Bible they put in hotel room drawers. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10226.439999999999s)]
*  But just imagine that that's the origin, right? [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10230.92s)]
*  So that's these animal skins that they found in clay pots in Qumran. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10233.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10239.56s)]
*  And they do DNA tests on the animal skins to make sure that they align the pieces [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10240.199999999999s)]
*  because it's all fragmented and broken apart. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10246.279999999999s)]
*  I had no idea they did that. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10248.279999999999s)]
*  So they have to figure out how to do, yeah, you have to have the same animal. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10248.76s)]
*  So it's like, okay, well, this is the same animal skin because we ran a DNA test on it. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10252.52s)]
*  And so then they get all the, it took forever. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10256.68s)]
*  It took forever for them to do this. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10259.960000000001s)]
*  That's why that John Marco Allegro book is so fascinating. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10262.84s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10267.72s)]
*  The sacred mushroom and the cross. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10268.28s)]
*  Yes. [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10269.880000000001s)]
*  That's why that book is fascinating because that guy studied the Dead Sea Scrolls for 14 years. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10270.28s)]
*  And he was an ordained minister who became agnostic when he started studying theology. [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10276.44s)]
*  He was like, hmm, hold on, let me reserve judgment. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10281.16s)]
*  And he was a straight scholar. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10285.32s)]
*  And it was his determination after all these years of studying the Dead Sea Scrolls, [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10287.32s)]
*  the entire Christian religion was a misunderstanding that what we think of it as today, [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10292.52s)]
*  what it really was, was about the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms and fertility rituals. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10297.480000000001s)]
*  And that it was all baked into the stories and that the stories, like even like the apple, [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10303.32s)]
*  like the forbidden apple, I mean, they're talking about the Amidate and Muscaria mushroom [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10309.720000000001s)]
*  that looked like an apple. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10313.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10314.68s)]
*  This is red. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10314.84s)]
*  And apparently even the translation of it in some, some people translated it to red [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10315.640000000001s)]
*  instead of like that apple, the term that it's actually means red. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10321.16s)]
*  That's what they're trying to say. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10326.12s)]
*  They're not even trying to say apple. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10327.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10328.6s)]
*  We've just converted it to an apple because that's the best, you know, that story, [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10329.08s)]
*  the way that story comes together, that you don't listen to God, you eat the apple and then, oh, [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10333.96s)]
*  fuck, now you ruined everything. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10337.8s)]
*  And that's kind of what he's saying about the whole idea of these psychedelic mushrooms, [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10340.28s)]
*  that they're hiding these things from their conquerors. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10347.96s)]
*  They're hiding these things from the Romans. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10351.32s)]
*  So they, I mean, imagine if you had access to God and you had a marauding, intrusive army [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10353.8s)]
*  that's about to come into, but you want to document all this stuff. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10361.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10363.72s)]
*  You have to kind of fucking document it in parables. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10363.88s)]
*  Yeah, hide it. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10366.44s)]
*  You have to hide it in stories. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10367.32s)]
*  Draw fish in the sand to let people know you're a Christian, which is so cool. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10369.0s)]
*  The underground Christianity is so cool. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10374.68s)]
*  And the stories of the Christian saints getting fucking butchered and ignited and then like [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10377.32s)]
*  crying, not because they're being immolated, but for the people immolating them. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10385.0s)]

*  greedy, angry, shadowy life. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10424.92s)]
*  Like in any second, there is a way to enter the kingdom of heaven, which is apparently here, [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10427.8s)]

*  what the demiurge is, it is the hypnotic zeitgeist that is being presented to us [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10445.8s)]
*  by hierarchical power structures that presents a universe of suffering and sorrow and hell [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10452.199999999999s)]

*  No one will fix this. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10465.960000000001s)]
*  Some version of that. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10467.4s)]
*  And what you do is you hypnotize people and now they worship you because they're [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10468.2s)]
*  connecting to fear. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10473.32s)]
*  And so this is like the story of like, you know, you embody that force, call it whatever you want. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10474.6s)]
*  Satan, you embody that force. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10480.36s)]
*  Hitler embodied Satan. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10483.4s)]
*  Yeah, just follow me. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10484.68s)]

*  You could actually watch it on YouTube. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10491.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10493.0s)]
*  He was in front of this gigantic throng of people. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10493.4s)]
*  I mean, he is the guy that's leading the Holocaust. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10496.039999999999s)]

*  They're shooting testosterone into him. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10505.56s)]
*  He's out of his fucking mind. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10507.4s)]
*  Blasted. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10508.76s)]

*  Now, if you're a regular person and you see someone talking with this kind of power. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10521.48s)]
*  Bro, you've seen him tweaking out at the Olympics. [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10535.56s)]

*  See if you can find that. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10543.48s)]
*  Hitler tweaking. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10545.24s)]
*  But see that that speech is fascinating because you're seeing it from there. [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10546.92s)]
*  There's some speeches where you see the size of the crowd that he was rallying for. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10550.12s)]
*  There he is tweaking. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10555.480000000001s)]
*  Not fun. [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10556.6s)]
*  Now, if you wanted to bring Satan into the material world, [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10557.480000000001s)]
*  you would do it through a guy like Hitler. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10562.68s)]
*  That's essentially Satan in the material world. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10564.36s)]
*  He essentially was Satan. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10566.76s)]
*  He was like a pawn of Satan. [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10569.880000000001s)]
*  If Satan is a real thing, well, what is evil? [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10571.560000000001s)]

*  And body evil. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10577.560000000001s)]
*  The Holocaust was evil. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10578.76s)]
*  What he did was evil. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10579.880000000001s)]
*  So how do you know that's not Satan? [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10581.16s)]
*  That's literally like satanic ideas embedded in a human being. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10584.68s)]
*  That's real. [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10590.68s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10591.24s)]
*  And you can call it evil. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10592.2s)]
*  You can call it corrupted by money. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10593.48s)]
*  You can call it corrupted by power. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10595.4s)]
*  You can come up with a bunch of names for it. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10597.32s)]
*  It's just evil. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10599.64s)]
*  He's still moving really fast. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10601.24s)]
*  I thought they sped it up because the other guy is moving really fast too. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10604.36s)]
*  Well, I think cameras were kind of goofy back then, right? [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10607.32s)]
*  But he's just tweaking hard. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10609.88s)]
*  No if, ands, or buts. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10611.32s)]

*  but nobody's there. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10616.52s)]
*  Looks like he's fucking. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10617.56s)]
*  You see his hand messing his legs. [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10618.36s)]
*  Oh, dude, he's about to pass out. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10619.56s)]
*  Bro, that guy looks... [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10621.8s)]

*  Like, take some CVD. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10628.68s)]
*  Someone on a podcast had the story, [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10630.52s)]
*  it might have been Dan Carlin, [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10632.6s)]
*  but there was a story about when Hitler... [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10633.88s)]
*  Maybe it wasn't, I'm not sure. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10636.2s)]
*  Hitler went to visit Mussolini, [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10637.560000000001s)]
*  and apparently he had just got back from a campaign, [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10639.560000000001s)]
*  and he was exhausted, [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10642.44s)]

*  and they shot him up with cocaine. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10646.12s)]
*  And Mussolini was going to try to get out of the war, [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10647.800000000001s)]

*  On coke. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10664.36s)]
*  You're both on coke, probably. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10665.66s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10673.34s)]
*  You know the story of Diogenes? [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10673.66s)]
*  I don't know how to pronounce it. [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10676.220000000001s)]
*  There's this story, [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10677.58s)]
*  this is some great philosopher, [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10678.54s)]
*  and Caesar hears about this great philosopher. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10680.7s)]
*  Apparently he was an ascetic, [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10683.18s)]
*  he's living by a river, [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10684.380000000001s)]
*  he's eating out of like a dog bowl, [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10687.980000000001s)]
*  but he's revered as this brilliant, brilliant mind. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10691.26s)]
*  And so Caesar goes to visit him with his like, you know, [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10695.42s)]
*  I don't know, chariot, you know, the imperial regalia, [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10699.74s)]
*  because he wants to co-opt the philosopher. [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10704.54s)]
*  That's what the state wants to do, [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10707.66s)]
*  is to create a connection between the philosopher and the state. [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10708.94s)]
*  So he goes there and he says to him, [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10712.380000000001s)]
*  I'll give you anything you want, just what is it? [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10715.82s)]
*  And he goes, can you move a few steps to the right? [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10719.42s)]
*  You're blocking the sun. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10722.86s)]
*  The ultimate takedown of that bullshit! [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10727.42s)]
*  You're just a fucking person. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10730.3s)]
*  That's all you are. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10732.78s)]
*  Whatever it is you've convinced other people to think you are, [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10734.22s)]
*  you're just like me, there's really no difference, [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10737.9s)]
*  and you just are doing everything you can [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10740.94s)]
*  to steal the limelight from nature, from God, [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10744.54s)]
*  from the light. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10749.26s)]
*  And it's so obvious. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10751.02s)]
*  There's nothing there. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10752.94s)]
*  It's smoke and mirrors. [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10753.9s)]
*  Wizard of Oz, it's when he comes out from behind the fucking curtain. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10755.02s)]
*  There's nothing there. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10758.14s)]
*  There's especially nothing compared to when you take the mushrooms [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10759.66s)]
*  that apparently inspire the Bible, [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10763.58s)]
*  and you get the direct transmission. [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10766.14s)]
*  And the direct transmission really doesn't give a shit about people like that. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10768.380000000001s)]
*  It's almost oblivious in a weird way. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10772.78s)]
*  But here's the question. [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10775.58s)]
*  Do you think that in order for significant cultural change, [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10777.019999999999s)]
*  sometimes people like that have to exist to elicit outrage? [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10780.46s)]
*  And that that's what wakes people up. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10784.46s)]
*  That's what leads people to understand that you just can't just let these feeble minds [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10786.14s)]
*  run civilization. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10792.14s)]
*  You just can't. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10793.66s)]
*  You can't. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10794.939999999999s)]
*  And you got to get involved because if you don't get involved, they stay in power. [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10795.58s)]
*  And the same fucking system corrupts your children, their children, [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10799.179999999998s)]
*  everyone's children in the future. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10802.38s)]
*  Everyone's a prisoner of this fucking stupid thing. [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10803.66s)]
*  And it's not worth it. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10806.539999999999s)]
*  It's not worth it even for the people that are perpetuating it [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10808.06s)]
*  because you're not going to live forever. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10810.22s)]
*  You're going to live and you're going to die. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10811.42s)]
*  And everybody's on the same fucking path. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10812.779999999999s)]
*  We got to make it better for everybody. [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10815.74s)]
*  And the only way to make it for better for everybody, [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10817.099999999999s)]
*  the only way to make it better for everybody is you got to remove money [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10819.099999999999s)]
*  and influence from any of these decisions. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10823.74s)]
*  We've got you can't you can't let people make money [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10826.619999999999s)]
*  because you've made decisions to kill folks. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10830.779999999999s)]
*  You can't let people make money because you've made decisions to imprison people. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10832.7s)]
*  Right. [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10836.62s)]
*  You can't. [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10836.86s)]
*  And any of that. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10837.26s)]
*  You can't reward it. [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10838.140000000001s)]
*  But you know, I think there's a precursor step. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10839.58s)]
*  I mean, the first step is mushrooms. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10842.220000000001s)]
*  Even before you take the mush, stop being an idolater. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10845.18s)]
*  Like in the fucking Bible, I always was confused. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10848.7s)]
*  Like what's this worshipping false idol shit? [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10851.5s)]
*  Because it just seemed odd. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10853.42s)]
*  I was like, why the fuck does God give a shit about that? [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10854.62s)]
*  It created the universe. [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10858.62s)]
*  So what? [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10859.5s)]
*  They're like throwing flowers at a cow. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10859.9s)]
*  Who fucking cares? [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10862.779999999999s)]
*  But now my old age, I get it because it's not it's not it's obviously it's representing. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10864.06s)]
*  Don't let anybody trick you into thinking that they're God. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10870.539999999999s)]
*  Don't let anybody trick you into thinking that they are some whatever the fuck it is. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10875.66s)]
*  Don't let don't let a middleman tell you that he's got a direct line to the divine [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10881.1s)]
*  that you don't have because whatever that may be, [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10887.02s)]
*  whether it's literally God, whether it's some access to some world of scientific information [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10889.58s)]
*  that you're too dumb to understand, whatever it may be, don't fall prey. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10894.86s)]
*  Don't succumb to that level of manipulation. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10899.66s)]
*  And the best way to do that is to look for the truth. [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10902.539999999999s)]
*  For me, that's God. [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10906.539999999999s)]
*  That's aligning with what I would think of as a transcendent, benevolent, ever expanding [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10907.42s)]
*  consciousness. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10914.62s)]
*  And then this is where the mushrooms come in. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10915.34s)]
*  And that at that point, once you get a taste of that, then the those tricks don't work [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10917.26s)]
*  anymore. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10923.74s)]
*  They don't work as well. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10924.06s)]
*  They could still work, but it doesn't work as well. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10925.02s)]
*  It's like you're not going to it's like you're if someone's giving you a steak. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10927.66s)]
*  And then like then so they're like, hey, do you want to go eat delicious steak with me [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10933.26s)]
*  here? [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10938.7s)]
*  Or do you should we just go to Sizzler? [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10939.02s)]
*  What are you going to say? [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10941.42s)]
*  What are you going to say? [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10943.18s)]
*  So that's the idea. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10944.06s)]
*  It's like those people are Sizzler. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10945.1s)]
*  It's not it doesn't you you you. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10947.02s)]
*  Number one, you don't care as much that you might die because you've connected with [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10949.26s)]
*  something that seems to transcend death. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10954.380000000001s)]
*  And so then once you've done that, what power do they fucking have? [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10957.58s)]
*  Now you're not afraid to die. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10960.86s)]
*  Now they're burning you alive and you're praying for them while you die. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10962.140000000001s)]
*  What? [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10965.74s)]
*  What a mind fuck. [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10967.02s)]
*  What a mind fuck. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10968.380000000001s)]
*  Watching someone you're emulating cry and pray for you because they they they they [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10969.5s)]
*  see how lost you are. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10975.1s)]
*  Oh, that person is not sleeping anymore. [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10977.34s)]
*  Like you're not sleeping after that. [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10980.300000000001s)]
*  You you it's so powerful, but you got to anchor yourself in something other than the world [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10982.460000000001s)]
*  or the world will drag your ass all over the place. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10988.060000000001s)]
*  Well, the world that we live in is the world of the animal. [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10990.460000000001s)]
*  We are animals and we're so connected to this biological existence that has fueled our [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10993.26s)]
*  evolution. [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=10999.74s)]
*  That's what we were a long time ago and we still have that DNA, that DNA of the survival [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11000.380000000001s)]
*  animal that is being threatened, that's encroached upon by the competition of survival [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11006.14s)]

*  You watch the way chimpanzees do it. [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11018.939999999999s)]

*  And there's got to be an understanding of that. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11025.34s)]
*  If we're going to we've got to understand that we're susceptible to like someone [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11030.22s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11274.7s)]
*  Because it literally creates everything. [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11275.02s)]
*  So whatever that is. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11276.78s)]
*  At one level it is that. [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11278.7s)]

*  Absolute reality. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11289.1s)]

*  Unit of consciousness. [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11299.1s)]
*  You are now part of the whole. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11300.94s)]
*  That's absolute reality. [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11303.42s)]
*  Relative reality is the chaos. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11305.58s)]
*  One does not negate the other. [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11309.26s)]
*  The two are working together in this beautiful dance that they do with each other. [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11311.42s)]
*  And so if you get lost in one or the other, you're going to embarrass yourself. [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11316.22s)]
*  This is the thing. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11322.22s)]
*  It's like if you get too caught up in absolute reality, then you're not paying your credit card bills. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11322.859999999999s)]
*  This is when Jesus said, offer unto Caesar what is Caesar's. [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11329.26s)]

*  Doesn't it also mirror the free will argument? [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11338.22s)]
*  The free will versus determinism. [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11340.699999999999s)]
*  Determinism states that you have no free will. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11343.5s)]
*  But clearly you do. [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11345.9s)]
*  You know you make choices. [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11347.34s)]
*  Absolutely. [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11348.62s)]
*  We all make choices. [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11349.1s)]
*  The idea that these choices are only made because of the contents of your existence. [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11349.9s)]
*  Kind of true, but also you can learn and make better choices next time. [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11354.94s)]
*  There's something going on. [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11360.539999999999s)]
*  So both things I think are going on. [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11361.74s)]
*  Simultaneously. [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11363.42s)]
*  But people want to be very dogmatic about it. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11364.22s)]
*  They will argue to the death that it's only determinism. [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11367.1s)]
*  And people will argue to the death that free will is what really shapes the world. [[03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11370.539999999999s)]
*  Determinism is nonsense. [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11375.66s)]
*  And there's been plenty of examples of people that came from horrific backgrounds, grew to become exemplary people. [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11376.86s)]
*  Yeah, the continuum runs from this kind of like, I don't know, eternalism and nihilism. [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11382.22s)]
*  That's the continuum. [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11389.82s)]
*  So, you know, when you get imbalanced in one or the other, there's like, it has a real effect on your life. [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11390.7s)]
*  The idea is, you know, for example, like, does God change? [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11400.46s)]
*  Maybe the personality of God changes. [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11406.06s)]
*  Maybe the idea that we aren't part of God. [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11407.98s)]
*  That if God is the totality of all things and the sum total of all lives that have ever lived outside and inside of time, you're part of God. [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11413.9s)]
*  You're part of the evolution of God. [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11422.22s)]
*  You're part of the outgrowth or outflow of the divine consciousness. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11424.14s)]
*  Like, that is who and what you are. [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11428.22s)]
*  And so you change. [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11431.66s)]
*  So God changes. [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11433.66s)]
*  In fact, it appears that God loves change because things are constantly changing within that creation. [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11434.619999999999s)]
*  If you want to use that model. [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11440.46s)]
*  Yeah, nothing is in a static state. [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11442.06s)]
*  Right. [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11444.14s)]
*  Yeah, which is why it drives me crazy when people talk about controlling the climate. [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11444.619999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, listen, we should definitely stop polluting. [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11450.46s)]
*  We should definitely stop releasing CO2 from emissions. [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11452.939999999999s)]
*  We should definitely stop doing all those things. [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11456.7s)]
*  We should definitely figure out a way to do something to stop the harm that industrial agriculture is doing to the earth. [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11458.54s)]
*  Absolutely. [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11465.02s)]
*  We definitely should figure that out. [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11465.66s)]
*  Also, this shit that's going to happen, you've got no say in ice ages, super volcanoes, asteroid impacts. [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11466.86s)]

*  I'll tell you that. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11503.019999999999s)]
*  It'll shake everything off and start again every fucking billion years if it wants to. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11503.58s)]
*  It's, I think it's very scary at first if you really acknowledge the reality of how finite you are [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11509.74s)]
*  and how the planet that you're on is uncontrollable and that we, maybe we can make some shifts. [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11520.380000000001s)]
*  Obviously, clearly carbonation, everything you said. [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11527.900000000001s)]
*  Obviously. [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11530.380000000001s)]
*  First of all, obviously. [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11531.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11532.460000000001s)]
*  Obviously. [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11533.02s)]

*  We all want that. [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11537.42s)]
*  Stop pretending some part of your species is like, somebody dump some oil in that fucking ocean out there. [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11538.54s)]
*  I want some. [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11546.38s)]
*  It's very condescending and I think it's non-productive if your goal is to get everyone on board, [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11548.54s)]
*  telling half of the people or whoever that they're fucking idiots is not going to get them to your rallies. [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11555.1s)]
*  There needs to be a little more compassion towards those people. [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11561.58s)]
*  But yeah, man, to deal with the real truth, which is like, no one's going to remember you in about 200 years. [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11565.1s)]
*  No one will think about you. [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11574.300000000001s)]

*  And hug as many people so they miss you. [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11595.42s)]
*  But that's about it, buddy. [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11598.060000000001s)]
*  We're all on some weird infinite journey. [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11599.74s)]
*  And I think some people have gotten a little confused into thinking that what they don't [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11602.060000000001s)]
*  understand that their attempt to like, quote, save the planet, which again, please do, [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11609.42s)]
*  is actually an attempt to keep themselves from dying. [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11615.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's 100%. [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11617.980000000001s)]
*  That's what it is. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11619.18s)]
*  It's also a righteous ideology to attach yourself to that elevates your social standing. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11619.98s)]
*  That's a problem with all environmental movements. [[03:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11624.779999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of people that run them that are douchebags. [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11627.1s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that run them that are beautiful, amazing people that really [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11629.26s)]
*  do just want to change the world. [[03:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11632.46s)]
*  And then there's people that attach themselves to movements. [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11633.98s)]
*  Because if you attach yourself to a righteous movement, you must be a righteous person. [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11637.18s)]
*  And so it exonerates them of all their shitty personality traits because they can say, hey, [[03:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11640.86s)]
*  man, I'm fucking doing this for the Earth. [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11644.699999999999s)]
*  And they have all this shitty fucking energy that's attached to a cause that you probably [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11647.74s)]
*  support. [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11652.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11652.86s)]
*  They're like, hey, man, how about fuck you? [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11653.34s)]
*  And then you don't even like the environment anymore. [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11655.66s)]
*  Now you want to use plastic straws. [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11657.5s)]
*  Fuck the turtles. [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11658.78s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11659.74s)]
*  I just don't see how a strategy that has built into it, condescending aggression, [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11660.300000000001s)]
*  is going to create the massive changes that you are prescribing. [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11667.18s)]
*  Yes. [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11673.02s)]
*  How the fuck is it even going to work? [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11673.58s)]
*  How is it possible? [[03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11675.02s)]
*  You are ignoring the entire human biome and the psychology of that biome and thinking, [[03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11675.82s)]
*  what are you going to do? [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11680.22s)]
*  Shame people into not using plastic? [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11681.02s)]
*  Are you going to humiliate people? [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11684.38s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11685.82s)]
*  Yeah, what are you going to do? [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11686.699999999999s)]
*  How does that work? [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11687.58s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11688.38s)]
*  It's never going to work. [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11689.42s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't work. [[03:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11690.94s)]
*  I saw fucking a meme online that was amazing. [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11691.5s)]
*  It was a paper straw in a plastic package. [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11695.02s)]
*  It's amazing looking at that, like how ridiculous that is. [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11701.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11704.46s)]
*  How is that not in the Babylon Bee or something? [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11704.86s)]
*  Is this real? [[03:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11707.34s)]
*  They really have a paper straw that's wrapped in a plastic package. [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11708.140000000001s)]
*  Fucking crazy. [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11711.58s)]
*  That's so nuts. [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11712.54s)]
*  Did it really all come out of that one sea turtle that got a straw up his nose, [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11714.62s)]
*  that horrible video that we all watched? [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11717.74s)]
*  That was the worst. [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11718.62s)]
*  That was horrible. [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11719.66s)]
*  Yeah, it came because of that sea turtle. [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11721.1s)]
*  I bet there was coke in that straw. [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11722.54s)]
*  Some kind of like Atlantean coke. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11726.94s)]
*  I think Joey Diaz actually said that. [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11729.26s)]
*  That's funny. [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11731.1s)]
*  A paper straw in plastic wrapper, the green movement in a single picture. [[03:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11732.46s)]
*  I think I might have stolen that from Joey. [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11735.74s)]
*  Joey, sorry. [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11737.34s)]
*  That's still a very funny joke. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11738.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out where I heard that. [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11740.14s)]
*  I think it's Joey. [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11742.06s)]
*  It's like, okay, let's think about the language of it, right? [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11743.98s)]
*  Okay, things are getting hot. [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11746.94s)]
*  We got to cool them down. [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11748.619999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11749.66s)]
*  Cool yourself down first because the idea is you are part of the planet. [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11750.38s)]
*  And the energy that you are invoking every day is hot, angry, fiery energy. [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11755.58s)]
*  It affects everyone around you and then it affects them as they affect other people. [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11762.78s)]
*  So since you're part of the planet, [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11765.9s)]
*  aside from doing all the things that make sense regarding carbon emissions or whatever it is [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11768.220000000001s)]
*  that you think is going to fix things, you have to do something a lot harder than recycling. [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11772.300000000001s)]
*  You have to calm down and get real peaceful [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11778.86s)]
*  because I think that's what you want in the world. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11783.74s)]
*  That's what everybody wants in the world. [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11786.14s)]
*  But it's just hard when you don't have it in yourself. [[03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11787.5s)]
*  So if you don't have it in yourself, you have to take control of your own biology [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11789.58s)]
*  and your own mind and help yourself first. [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11793.1s)]
*  Once you help yourself and you put that energy out there, [[03:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11795.98s)]
*  you could affect the people around you. [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11799.82s)]
*  They can affect the people around them. [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11801.42s)]
*  That's why some neighborhoods are better than, you know, not just because of economics, [[03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11802.86s)]
*  but also because some areas are like filled with nicer people. [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11807.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11809.5s)]
*  You know, it's like you get a good neighborhood. [[03:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11809.98s)]
*  You got a good neighborhood. [[03:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11811.58s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11812.38s)]
*  You got a great neighbor. [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11812.94s)]
*  Like, hey, buddy, what's up? [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11813.74s)]
*  Like, you're cool with them? [[03:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11814.94s)]
*  It's the best. [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11815.74s)]

*  It's wonderful. [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11818.060000000001s)]
*  You know, I had the best fucking neighbor in California. [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11819.02s)]
*  He's the nicest guy and his fucking house caught on fire. [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11821.82s)]
*  And my friend, Bud, actually had his house fire put out [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11826.78s)]
*  because he was friends with the firemen and he stayed in while they evacuated. [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11830.94s)]
*  I was so happy that they saved this guy's house. [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11834.380000000001s)]
*  That's so cool. [[03:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11836.62s)]
*  Such a good dude. [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11837.58s)]
*  It's so nice when you do like like people and you see them. [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11839.42s)]
*  There's a guy in my neighborhood and every time I drive by, he waves at me. [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11841.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11846.38s)]
*  He's this old fella and he's always like tending to his garden. [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=11846.699999999999s)]

*  And it's like they have, you go into the town, [[03:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12230.46s)]
*  they have a replica of it that's at the beginning of the town. [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12233.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12236.46s)]
*  It's like as you're entering into the town, they have a fucking UFO. [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12236.699999999999s)]
*  Everyone who was alive back then has a story of seeing these things flying through the air. [[03:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12239.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12244.779999999999s)]
*  The people that made contact with these creatures, [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12245.02s)]
*  one of them died of a horrible bacterial infection. [[03:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12247.98s)]
*  There's record of them transporting it to three different hospitals. [[03:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12251.66s)]

*  Wild shit. [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12257.82s)]
*  They did an autopsy on it, supposedly. [[03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12258.54s)]
*  The Air Force supposedly flew into Vargenia, Brazil and came back with the wreckage. [[03:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12260.380000000001s)]

*  No, the United States Air Force. [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12269.660000000002s)]
*  Why did they give away their UFO? [[03:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12270.78s)]
*  Because they probably had to. [[03:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12273.26s)]
*  There's probably, look, governments give countries aid. [[03:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12274.78s)]

*  If there's one country that really does have both possession of crashed UFOs and has a whole division, [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12286.539999999999s)]
*  a secret division, where they find crashed UFOs and retrieve them. [[03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12294.779999999999s)]
*  This is what this guy David Grush is saying. [[03:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12301.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12303.5s)]
*  He's saying they do have that. [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12303.82s)]
*  They are in possession of that. [[03:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12305.1s)]
*  They're lying to Congress. [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12306.38s)]
*  They're not showing Congress this. [[03:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12307.74s)]
*  They're not showing the American people this. [[03:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12309.82s)]
*  If they did, if we knew, how much of, I mean, [[03:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12312.06s)]
*  this is the Ronald Reagan speech to the United Nations. [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12314.7s)]
*  Did you ever hear that speech? [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12317.34s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12318.380000000001s)]
*  It's an amazing speech. [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12318.94s)]
*  Because it made all the people, the UFO dorks go, yes, it's real. [[03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12320.94s)]
*  But there was nothing forever. [[03:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12325.66s)]
*  Nothing. [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12327.34s)]
*  You have to be a UFO fanatic from like 1980 to like 2017. [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12327.820000000002s)]
*  You had to be a moron. [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12335.42s)]
*  Come on. [[03:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12338.62s)]
*  I was a moron. [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12339.66s)]
*  Look, I was one of those guys. [[03:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12340.7s)]
*  But you had, there was not much. [[03:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12342.300000000001s)]
*  You weren't getting much. [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12344.06s)]
*  You occasionally get a book. [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12345.1s)]
*  I remember. [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12347.1s)]
*  I mean, Roswell, you had Roswell. [[03:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12348.22s)]
*  You did have Roswell, but you also had some weird stuff. [[03:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12350.859999999999s)]
*  And one of the weird things we had was the abduction phenomenon. [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12353.9s)]
*  That was very weird. [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12359.34s)]
*  The guy from Harvard, John Mack, who did all those hypnotic regression sessions with people [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12362.06s)]
*  that claimed to have been abducted, and they were eerily similar. [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12368.14s)]
*  Eerily similar. [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12372.14s)]
*  But apparently, people have questioned his methodology, [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12373.74s)]
*  and people have questioned the leading nature of whether or not he led people into these thoughts. [[03:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12377.26s)]
*  By questioning and asking them, what have you experienced? [[03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12384.54s)]
*  Have you been countering UFOs as an alien? [[03:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12389.34s)]
*  I don't know what he asked. [[03:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12391.66s)]
*  You know what it's called? [[03:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12392.94s)]
*  Swamp gassing. [[03:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12393.74s)]
*  You know what that term, swamp gassing? [[03:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12394.94s)]
*  No, it's not. [[03:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12397.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12398.62s)]
*  You attribute, yeah. [[03:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12399.26s)]
*  So people are having legitimate experiences all around the fucking planet, [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12401.179999999998s)]
*  and then people are like, they're all crazy, or they were all tricked into saying something. [[03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12404.14s)]
*  What are the criticisms of John Mack? [[03:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12410.22s)]
*  See if you can find Google criticisms of John Mack abduction hypnotherapy. [[03:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12411.5s)]
*  Man, I gotta use a pass. [[03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12417.019999999999s)]
*  This is the problem with these things. [[03:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12418.939999999999s)]
*  Like, we have a zipper on the back. [[03:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12420.779999999999s)]
*  Oh, no. [[03:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12423.66s)]
*  Yeah, I gotta unzip you here before you can pee. [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12424.3s)]
*  Will you unzip me, Park Park? [[03:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12426.46s)]
*  Should we end this? [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12427.82s)]
*  We're at like four hours. [[03:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12428.539999999999s)]
*  Four hours? [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12430.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's been four hours. [[03:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12431.42s)]
*  Dude, we can't end it on the middle of a UFO thing. [[03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12432.619999999999s)]
*  We gotta finish out the, I will hold. [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12435.66s)]
*  Okay. [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12437.66s)]
*  I will piss in my fucking furry outfit. [[03:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12438.3s)]
*  Well, we don't have to. [[03:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12441.9s)]
*  We could just end. [[03:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12443.58s)]
*  No, let's, no, I mean, I like to. [[03:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12444.3s)]
*  That's something, I don't want, that's something Meow Meow does. [[03:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12447.019999999999s)]
*  What do you got? [[03:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12450.3s)]
*  The John Mack thing. [[03:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12450.939999999999s)]

*  Oh, the John Mack thing. [[03:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12452.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[03:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12453.099999999999s)]
*  How are you doing? [[03:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12456.22s)]
*  You all right over there with your pee-pee? [[03:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12456.939999999999s)]

*  It's hard to concentrate. [[03:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12459.34s)]
*  Meow Meow likes to pee on himself. [[03:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12460.380000000001s)]
*  No Meow Meow, don't do it in my studio. [[03:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12462.86s)]
*  Ari's already done that. [[03:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12464.62s)]
*  Ari's pissing here half a dozen times. [[03:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12466.06s)]
*  In the old one, he used to like piss in kombucha bottles. [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12468.7s)]
*  Yeah, so he interviewed all those children in Zimbabwe that had a mass sighting. [[03:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12473.42s)]
*  And that one's very compelling. [[03:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12476.94s)]
*  Very, very, very compelling. [[03:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12479.02s)]
*  Because all these kids have the same story. [[03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12480.94s)]
*  And he talks to them independently and they all have the same story. [[03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12482.78s)]
*  Look, look, man, if these fucking whistleblowers are telling the truth, [[03:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12486.3s)]
*  we have been visited. [[03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12489.66s)]
*  And these kids are telling the truth, [[03:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12491.18s)]
*  which makes way more sense than they're all just lying and they all have the same story. [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12492.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12496.54s)]
*  Doesn't make sense. [[03:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12496.94s)]
*  It's going to be so fun to go back through every single, [[03:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12498.06s)]
*  like one of these events that we have like rolled our eyes at [[03:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12501.82s)]
*  from the perspective that we have UFOs. [[03:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12506.460000000001s)]
*  Can you play some of this, Jamie? [[03:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12509.02s)]
*  Yeah, when I remember reading about this, though, I just want to add this in. [[03:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12510.06s)]
*  I read that this is be antithetical to what he's saying or what we're hearing right now. [[03:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12513.82s)]
*  He spoke to all these kids in like a big room. [[03:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12519.179999999998s)]
*  There's like 60 kids and he talked to them all at once. [[03:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12522.859999999999s)]
*  And asking sort of was like leading them on questions. [[03:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12525.259999999998s)]
*  Did you see this? Did you see that? [[03:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12528.14s)]
*  And a couple of them did. [[03:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12529.339999999998s)]
*  And then when they're in this environment where he's talking to them one on one, [[03:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12530.699999999999s)]
*  they're kind of all remembering what they talked about in that room. [[03:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12532.939999999999s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[03:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12534.939999999999s)]
*  I don't know if that's exactly what happened, but that's what I read to be like. [[03:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12536.939999999999s)]
*  But let's hear the kids talk. [[03:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12539.82s)]
*  Where was the pointy part? [[03:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12541.259999999998s)]
*  Was the pointy part in here or is the pointy part up there? [[03:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12542.779999999999s)]
*  And what was the back? [[03:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12548.46s)]
*  Back it up, Jamie, so I can hear what he's talking about here. [[03:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12550.46s)]
*  Like the pointy part out there. [[03:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12552.619999999999s)]

*  It was scary. [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12574.699999999999s)]
*  And what was scary? [[03:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12578.699999999999s)]
*  Why? [[03:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12579.98s)]
*  What made it scary? [[03:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12580.3s)]
*  The eyes looked evil. [[03:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12582.38s)]
*  Evil. [[03:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12584.06s)]

*  Say what you mean by evil. [[03:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12588.06s)]
*  It looked evil because it was just staring at me. [[03:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12597.099999999999s)]

*  What happened? [[03:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12624.300000000001s)]
*  I just... [[03:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12624.7s)]
*  I moved to and I started crying. [[03:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12625.26s)]
*  They came running up here in such a panic. [[03:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12627.900000000001s)]
*  And I mean even if we had staged it, they could not have run all together like that. [[03:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12630.78s)]
*  If we practiced it, I don't know how many times. [[03:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12635.02s)]
*  That they came up here like a living snake. [[03:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12637.5s)]
*  And they just came... [[03:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12640.220000000001s)]
*  We were in a golf meeting and we just heard them screaming, screaming. [[03:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12641.18s)]
*  Ah! [[03:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12643.980000000001s)]
*  And they were like, yeah, you know. [[03:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12644.54s)]
*  And a child can't make that up. [[03:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12645.820000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[03:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12649.02s)]
*  I was very skeptical in the beginning as well. [[03:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12649.18s)]
*  I believed that they'd seen something. [[03:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12652.140000000001s)]
*  But I wasn't prepared to accept that it was anything supernatural, anything like that. [[03:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12654.380000000001s)]
*  So if we know now that they actually do visit. [[03:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12658.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12662.140000000001s)]
*  And that there actually has been some sort of contact. [[03:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12662.46s)]
*  And when that guy was describing, you have physical bodies. [[03:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12666.3s)]
*  He's saying if you have a crashed vehicle, sometimes you have a dead pilot. [[03:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12671.419999999998s)]
*  That was his way of describing it. [[03:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12674.939999999999s)]
*  Like, holy shit, man. [[03:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12676.3s)]
*  That means they come and there's an actual alien. [[03:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12679.019999999999s)]
*  So imagine you're in Zimbabwe and you're a kid just hanging out at school. [[03:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12682.22s)]
*  And a fucking actual UFO lands and aliens get out. [[03:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12685.5s)]
*  And you think they're thinking about taking you. [[03:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12689.339999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12691.419999999998s)]
*  And that was kind of planted in her head by him, I felt. [[03:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12691.98s)]
*  Right. [[03:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12694.539999999999s)]
*  I felt like that was kind of leading. [[03:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12695.1s)]
*  Like he led her to say that. [[03:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12697.02s)]
*  I feel like there's a way that you could have talked to her. [[03:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12699.42s)]
*  First of all, you'd have to calm her down first. [[03:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12701.9s)]
*  My strategy would be to get her very relaxed talking first. [[03:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12704.539999999999s)]
*  I don't know if they did that, but ask her a bunch of questions. [[03:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12708.22s)]
*  What do you like to do? [[03:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12711.1s)]
*  What's your favorite part of school? [[03:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12712.14s)]
*  What's your favorite subject? [[03:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12714.539999999999s)]
*  Play any sports? [[03:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12716.06s)]
*  Do you have any games you like? [[03:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12716.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12717.9s)]
*  Just talk about it. [[03:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12718.06s)]
*  Kids love to talk about things they like to talk about. [[03:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12718.619999999999s)]
*  Right. [[03:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12720.699999999999s)]
*  And then go, I'm really sorry this happened to you, but can you tell me what happened? [[03:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12721.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12726.380000000001s)]
*  And then just let them talk. [[03:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12726.86s)]
*  Let them talk. [[03:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12728.22s)]
*  And you don't say, did you feel like it was trying to take you? [[03:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12729.42s)]
*  Right. [[03:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12732.86s)]
*  Like don't you don't. [[03:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12733.18s)]
*  Don't plant anything. [[03:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12733.98s)]
*  I think you, yeah, I think with a little kid, you have to say, so why was it evil? [[03:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12734.7s)]
*  Was it evil because you couldn't see their eyeball? [[03:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12740.78s)]
*  Because their eyes were different? [[03:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12742.7s)]
*  Right. [[03:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12743.82s)]
*  You know, like what felt evil? [[03:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12744.380000000001s)]
*  Because like if you look into a fucking eagle's eyes, they look evil. [[03:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12745.74s)]
*  Sure. [[03:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12748.94s)]
*  Eagles look evil. [[03:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12749.82s)]
*  Their eyes looking at you like this. [[03:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12751.02s)]
*  They're glaring. [[03:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12752.78s)]
*  If an eagle was as big as you, it would be fucking terrifying. [[03:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12753.42s)]
*  Dude, that would be the worst, but you could saddle them. [[03:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12756.78s)]
*  But do you know they used to have a bird like that? [[03:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12760.78s)]
*  It was called a terror bird. [[03:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12763.18s)]
*  It was like an enormous bird that lived in North America that was like, [[03:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12764.78s)]
*  I think it was way bigger than like a human being. [[03:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12768.380000000001s)]
*  They were fucking huge, huge predatory birds that didn't fly. [[03:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12772.220000000001s)]
*  You ever heard of these things? [[03:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12776.380000000001s)]
*  Terror birds? [[03:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12777.74s)]
*  Terror birds. [[03:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12778.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12779.18s)]
*  Google terror birds. [[03:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12779.74s)]
*  There was these ancient birds that lived. [[03:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12783.9s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[03:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12787.34s)]
*  I don't know how long ago, man, but they were fucking enormous. [[03:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12788.06s)]
*  Look, there's some images of like what one looked like next. [[03:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12791.98s)]
*  Yeah, the up top where it looked like. [[03:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12795.1s)]
*  No, no, no, up top, up top. [[03:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12796.78s)]
*  That's the that's that's how big they were. [[03:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12798.460000000001s)]
*  So you could have written one of these. [[03:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12800.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah, fucking for sure. [[03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12802.54s)]
*  It didn't eat your dick immediately. [[03:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12803.9s)]
*  It would swallow you whole. [[03:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12805.66s)]
*  You ever see like a fucking pelican swallow a seagull whole? [[03:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12807.74s)]
*  Dude, that would be what it would be doing to a human. [[03:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12811.58s)]
*  Just gulp you down. [[03:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12813.74s)]
*  That was a real animal, dude. [[03:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12815.02s)]
*  That is how I would dress if I wrote one. [[03:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12816.699999999999s)]
*  Imagine if you could fucking get one of those things to follow your lead. [[03:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12819.42s)]
*  Look, he's got a bite in the thing in its mouth, a bridle. [[03:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12822.38s)]
*  But the reality was, I think they were way before people. [[03:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12825.9s)]
*  Like, when do these things exist? [[03:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12828.94s)]
*  Terror bird exists here. [[03:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12831.98s)]
*  Size of these motherfuckers. [[03:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12835.66s)]
*  Terror bird. [[03:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12836.619999999999s)]
*  What an awesome name for a fucking cool. [[03:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12837.42s)]
*  They range from three meters to 10 feet. [[03:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12840.460000000001s)]
*  What does it say? [[03:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12843.74s)]
*  This is cut it out there. [[03:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12844.460000000001s)]
*  66 million years. [[03:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12845.58s)]
*  So it says they range from one to three meters. [[03:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12846.3s)]
*  So three to 10 feet. [[03:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12848.38s)]
*  So a big one was 10 feet tall. [[03:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12849.9s)]
*  So 53 to. [[03:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12852.14s)]
*  Wow. [[03:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12854.7s)]
*  Zero. [[03:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12855.82s)]
*  100,000 years ago. [[03:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12856.22s)]
*  So they lived alongside human beings. [[03:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12857.34s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[03:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12859.58s)]

*  Human. [[03:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12861.9s)]
*  No wonder why they're dead. [[03:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMsJZ2SRHo&t=12862.3s)]
