# Joe Rogan Experience #2145 - Colin Quinn
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7WfCtF7Rik)
*  Hello Joe, Joe that was fun last night.
*  Let me just start by saying what a fun time at the club, the green room and everything
*  else and here's what I was talking to the head of security at the club.
*  Here's what I love about the club.
*  I worked at the club.
*  I had a great weekend a couple of months ago.
*  Is they keep the audience in line.
*  Nobody's heckling without getting booted.
*  Is that not the most important thing in comedy that nobody talks about?
*  It's very important.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  And unfortunately, there's so many crowd work clips that get put out on Instagram.
*  People are now thinking that they want to be a part of the show.
*  I see people much more often chiming in and yelling things out and they think they're
*  going to be a part of things.
*  Yeah.
*  And even when you go, when you try to be nice on the first line, you go, that was okay,
*  sir.
*  Then they try again.
*  You're like, listen, you P. Oh my God.
*  But that's what I love about your club.
*  Everybody there just has the energy like, we're going to tell you right now, another
*  word you're out.
*  That's how it should be.
*  Yeah.
*  Because as you know, there's no, nobody heckles once.
*  Right.
*  Nobody's ever heckled once.
*  Nobody heckles sober either.
*  And nobody heckles sober.
*  And they just like to start trouble.
*  And the green one was fun.
*  And even though I didn't go on, I also didn't go on because you have to understand the language
*  where I was like, you want to go on?
*  I go, I don't really want to go on.
*  You go, that's cool.
*  But really, then you're supposed to say, the crowd really wants you to go on.
*  And I'm like, Joe, I don't want to bump anybody.
*  No, you wouldn't be bumping anybody.
*  We'll just cut Tony's time down.
*  Joe, I don't want to be that guy.
*  You're like, don't be ridiculous.
*  Oh, I have to dance with you.
*  Go on.
*  I didn't know you wanted to dance.
*  If you want to dance tonight.
*  No, I got to leave and go to Seattle.
*  What the fuck?
*  I got to go.
*  I would love to.
*  Yeah.
*  Are you performing tonight?
*  No, no.
*  Maybe I can change my flight.
*  Well, let's see.
*  Maybe I can change it.
*  Move it around.
*  Let's play your flights out of Austin.
*  It's a wonderful hub.
*  It is.
*  It's great.
*  It keeps booming every time I see it.
*  Last time I saw it was COVID.
*  Yeah, I don't think it's going to get too much bigger.
*  I think we've reached peak.
*  You think so?
*  Yeah, yeah, I think it's about it.
*  You think Shane Gillis was the last citizen they allowed in?
*  No, no, no.
*  I think Shane Gillis was the last citizen they allowed in?
*  No, there's a few more coming.
*  Joe DeRosa just got a place here.
*  He did?
*  Yeah, and Joey Diaz is getting a place here.
*  I can't believe the two Joe D's are going to be here.
*  Let's go.
*  That's great.
*  Joe Diaz and Joe DeRosa is a fierce combination.
*  I know, but I spoke to Joe DeRosa yesterday.
*  I deliberately didn't go to the chicken place because of Joe DeRosa.
*  Really?
*  Why?
*  Because when he recommended it, it just bugged me.
*  His confidence when he goes, you got to try this chicken place.
*  It's Gus's Fried Chicken and it's phenomenal.
*  I just don't like that Joe is positioning himself as the new gastronomic expert in comedy.
*  Right, because he owns a sub shop.
*  By the way, it's a good sub shop though.
*  I heard it's amazing.
*  It's fucking great.
*  I'm embarrassed that he's moving.
*  It's fucking great.
*  He brought some over when they were doing Moon Tower.
*  He was in town.
*  He brought some subs over.
*  They were fucking tremendous.
*  He's got a great place.
*  I always look at the Instagram photos.
*  I'm like, oh my God, they look so good.
*  They said the bread's amazing.
*  Everything's amazing.
*  The food's amazing.
*  He makes a great sub.
*  Obviously, it's a labor of love.
*  He's a professional comic.
*  It's a side thing.
*  He's like, I like sandwiches.
*  Let's make a sandwich shop.
*  He knocked it out of the park.
*  Everybody who goes are big subs, not expensive.
*  The name Joey Roses is good.
*  Yes, it's great.
*  It's great.
*  It's anger producing in some ways.
*  In a lot of ways for you.
*  You have a thing with him, I think.
*  With Joe?
*  Yeah.
*  I try to have a thing with everybody.
*  That's my thing, Joe.
*  I like to have a thing.
*  If you had studied straight karate and weren't into MMA, maybe I could have a thing with
*  you, but let's face it, you don't play games.
*  I do play games.
*  You're not to be taken lightly.
*  No, I don't.
*  Before I came down here, because in New York, it's so funny, we were in the green room last
*  night.
*  All I want to do is bust balls with everybody.
*  That's what I live for.
*  It's fun.
*  When you see Shane Gillis in there, Shane Gillis is just that guy.
*  He's so big.
*  I just want you to lock him in a basement and just feed him red meat and make him train
*  MMA for two years and just eat masculine and red meat and just become a stone cold killer.
*  Wow.
*  That's my dream.
*  I've got him working out.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  He looked sore yesterday.
*  He said he really looked sore.
*  We did two hard days this week.
*  Look how big he is.
*  He's a big fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm a big player kid.
*  If I was as big as him, I wouldn't be a comic.
*  No?
*  I'd be an animal.
*  I'd be working security at the club.
*  Telling people shut up.
*  Tony's trying to do something with me.
*  Comedy's like, it's got an anger to it, don't you think?
*  A little bit.
*  Yeah, it's got to.
*  Well, there's just so much resistance.
*  It's so difficult to get through.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of fucking running up that river.
*  Yeah.
*  Even when we talk to each other, I'm at the cellar the other night, so here's what happened.
*  I'm just sitting there.
*  Keith is there.
*  Norton's there.
*  I just give the waitress ... First of all, I'm like the Sinatra of tipping.
*  I didn't want to bring this up, but now I'm bringing it up because this is part of the
*  story.
*  I tip them, but I always put it there because I'm trying not to flash how much I tip.
*  I'm trying to do it like that.
*  Norton goes, ugh, you're tipping.
*  You're not part of the rat pack.
*  They just start trashing me for 10 minutes.
*  Meanwhile, what I should have said was I'm only doing that so you cheap bastards don't
*  look bad.
*  I understand.
*  Yeah.
*  This is a daily thing.
*  I enjoy tipping myself.
*  Yeah.
*  I could see you're a high roller too.
*  It's like a little love bomb.
*  Give a little love bomb.
*  Yes.
*  An extra few dollars and it makes their whole day.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't even feel it.
*  It makes people happy.
*  I always try to tell my cheap friends, I'm like, you got to get over that.
*  Fuck that 15%.
*  What are you doing?
*  I agree.
*  There's a lot of chiselers.
*  And they think of excuses.
*  Like, oh, you see that attitude you gave me.
*  Yeah.
*  I give people big tips and they give me shitty service.
*  I just want everybody to be happy.
*  Yeah.
*  You can give them a little happiness and maybe they'll be nicer to the next people.
*  The butterfly effect.
*  Well, it's certainly not working for the planet right now.
*  Let's face it.
*  Eh, we're all right.
*  I think the problem is we're inundated with bad news constantly.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the real problem.
*  And then, you know, there's also like the problems in cities.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, everywhere.
*  I mean, you know, you just did a special, by the way, about it's releasing tomorrow.
*  It's about, I did it in front of a psychiatrist's convention.
*  Did you really?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  I just did it.
*  And so I found it.
*  I saw it out of psychiatrist's convention and went there and said, hey, would you guys
*  let me go on and just do my, shoot my special in front of you?
*  And they said, sure.
*  So I did a whole thing.
*  Then they analyzed me afterwards and it was funny.
*  What room was it at?
*  It was a ballroom, like one of those conventions.
*  It was like a Washington, D.C., some hotel off the beaten path where they were just having
*  a convention.
*  And they did not plan on you being there?
*  No.
*  And so you knew they were going to be there at that time.
*  Yeah.
*  And you coordinated with them, set up cameras, the whole deal.
*  Yeah.
*  And you told them beforehand, the psychiatrist beforehand, they were going to be a part of
*  a comedy special?
*  Well, they were welcome to come to the show or not.
*  But yeah, we told them before, you know, if you come, you might be on film.
*  But yeah, they didn't have to show up.
*  Obviously, half of them probably showed up.
*  But it was interesting.
*  That's a great idea.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought it was because it's about the world, how we're having a psychotic break when we
*  talk about the planet.
*  So it was kind of fun for me because, you know, it was interesting for that angle, you
*  know, the whole special is built around it.
*  It's so much more discussed.
*  The bad news is so much more discussed.
*  People's problems are so much more discussed.
*  Having problems is so much more a thing that people love to talk about now.
*  It makes you more interesting.
*  It gives you something to talk about.
*  And it's just so pervasive.
*  And I think social media has just broken people's brains.
*  Social media started as a fun aunt's kitchen where everybody was being positive and saying
*  hey, you know, dance between the raindrops.
*  And then suddenly somebody was like, shut up, bitch, you fat bitch.
*  Fuck you and the raindrops.
*  And it just unleashed all of us.
*  That's what I say.
*  It's like it unleashed that part of people.
*  And here's the other thing, which I think you'd be interested in.
*  It's the first time in history you can threaten people and curse them out and not have to
*  run or have a physical confrontation.
*  So fight or flight instinct is going to be eliminated from our genetics in two generations.
*  Not just that, but also you don't feel bad.
*  Like if you say something shitty to someone, you see the look on their face, even if you
*  feel like you should have done it, when you're alone at night, you might be like, I didn't
*  have to do that.
*  Why did I do that?
*  What a fucking asshole I am.
*  I gotta apologize.
*  And then you'll see him the next day.
*  I was out of line.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I was dealing with a lot of shit.
*  My mom, my sister, my this, my that.
*  Sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  There's none of that.
*  You don't even know these people, too.
*  You don't have to say you can't just say the most evil, mean shit, vicious shit.
*  Look through their pictures.
*  Look at you, you fat fuck.
*  You're fucking toothless smile.
*  And they used to have they used to have gossip magazines.
*  Like if celebrities in the 1950s, that's when they started to realize people love to read
*  bad scandalous stuff.
*  But now you get to respond.
*  You're like the writer and the reader of the gossip magazine.
*  You know, I do enjoy though, when people don't understand how it works and they'll post something
*  and just get smashed in the comments and then they'll start going back and forth with people
*  in the comments like, what are you doing?
*  Yeah.
*  What are you doing?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Well, what about?
*  Well, one of the biggest problems is people.
*  This is one of many of them trying to be funny that they they've never had to.
*  They've always thought they were kind of funny.
*  And then they go in and try to be funny and they get away with a couple because they have
*  two people to go, hey, that was good.
*  They start to think I'm funny.
*  And then they get in there and people just start destroying them for trying to be funny
*  because they're not used to the heckling that we're used to.
*  We got trained out of all our hack habits.
*  Yeah.
*  Comedy trains you.
*  The audience trains you.
*  And being around the comics.
*  And being around the comics.
*  The comics are like, what the fuck was that joke?
*  It regulates you.
*  Yeah.
*  It does.
*  It does.
*  Yeah, you get feedback.
*  Yeah.
*  Feedback's important, positive and negative.
*  It's a whole other level.
*  Yeah.
*  Who gets more feedback than comics?
*  We get real live feedback from hundreds of people every night.
*  Every night.
*  You got feedback last night.
*  Just last night.
*  You can't live in a theoretical world of like, I think this is funny.
*  I think this is good.
*  You're getting feedback.
*  Yeah.
*  It's fun though.
*  Don't you still enjoy it?
*  It's the best.
*  It's the only honest reaction you could get in today.
*  There's nothing virtual about it.
*  The most honest form of entertainment because you write it, you perform it, you produce
*  it, you edit it.
*  I was saying how easy doing sitcoms was when I first started doing sitcoms.
*  Oh yeah, that's right.
*  I go, they're great writers.
*  They write you great jokes.
*  You don't even have to work hard.
*  And I was talking about how bad my acts suffered during those days because when I was first
*  on a sitcom in 94, we were working like 12 hours a day on this radio.
*  News radio?
*  It was long, long, long days.
*  So by the end of the day, I'm exhausted.
*  So if I did go up, it was just the same old material, just rehab.
*  I wasn't connected to it anymore.
*  I was like flat, you know?
*  And because when they're writing for you, it's so much easier.
*  Like the jokes are already there.
*  All you have to do is like add your little sauce to them.
*  It's great.
*  Flare them up a little bit.
*  I know.
*  I get so jealous of the idea of like the old days comedians would just have writers.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Like, what do you got for me?
*  We got to go out and think of this stuff.
*  A few people still do that, right?
*  Yeah, I'm sure you guys do.
*  Like I know obviously the guys who host talk shows do.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, you can't write a new monologue every day.
*  You'd be out of your mind or you'd be out of your mind.
*  I did on Tough Crowd.
*  You wrote that every day?
*  I'm not saying most of them didn't bomb, but I did write them all myself.
*  No shit.
*  Yeah.
*  When I went to see you on Tough Crowd, the best part of it was you warming up the crowd.
*  I was like, why don't they show this?
*  This is funnier than the rest of the whole show.
*  It was so good.
*  It's so good.
*  It was fun.
*  It was fun.
*  And that crowd was crazy.
*  They would come like a lot.
*  Well, I was living in California at the time and I just like, sometimes I forget.
*  Sometimes, you know, sometimes you haven't seen a guy in a while and you're like, God
*  damn, I forgot how funny Conor is.
*  Right, right, right.
*  You know, you just, you need to see it.
*  You need to see them live.
*  You do.
*  You need to go out and see it.
*  Yeah.
*  Just get in your head.
*  It's the best thing.
*  I mean, I've been doing it for so long, but I still love it.
*  I love it.
*  I love crowds.
*  I love watching it.
*  I love doing it.
*  I love it.
*  It's so much fun.
*  And what's fun about it too is you can't, if you don't, it's like working out.
*  If you don't do it, you just get flabby and out of shape.
*  Yeah.
*  That's it.
*  No if, ands, or buts about it.
*  When I take a time off, I go on vacation for like 10 days.
*  I'll have one really good set when I come back because I'm enthusiastic.
*  Yeah.
*  The second set is like a little fucking shaky.
*  I'm like, what's going on with this set?
*  And that's what's great.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a horror, but that's the best part about it.
*  It's just reality.
*  Everybody that steps away from it too long, they talk in this term where it's like, oh,
*  you got to do it with reality.
*  I'm mediocre when I get on stage.
*  I'm going to be mediocre tonight, even though I don't want to be.
*  And I'm like, hey, I really figured this out.
*  And guess what?
*  I didn't figure it out.
*  And the crowd just lets you know.
*  That's the beauty.
*  How much time did you take off during COVID?
*  I did a few shows.
*  I mean, I did some shows that were like on, I did remote shows, which I loved remote comedy.
*  Really?
*  I loved it.
*  Like Zoom comedy?
*  Zoom comedy.
*  You loved it?
*  I loved it.
*  You're the only guy I've talked to.
*  Everybody else said it was hell.
*  Because I just read.
*  They think I'm looking at them.
*  I'm reading my act.
*  So any new material was memorized immediately.
*  Oh.
*  It was crazy.
*  Every new joke.
*  Maybe you should get a teleprompter.
*  What's that?
*  Maybe you should get a teleprompter.
*  I've tried teleprompters, yeah.
*  Yeah?
*  I wish I could bring them up all the time, yeah.
*  You tried it on stage?
*  I love teleprompters.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Yeah.
*  No, it's a good way to make sure you remember your shit.
*  Yes.
*  Teleprompter's the greatest.
*  Because the worst feeling is when you get back to the green room and you're like, fuck
*  that tagline.
*  I forgot the tagline.
*  Yeah.
*  Or even the intro line.
*  So you're like, of course it bombed.
*  I didn't even explain what I was going to talk about.
*  Yeah.
*  I love it.
*  Yeah.
*  Teleprompter's great.
*  But I've used teleprompters on shows when I did like one-man shows in New York.
*  And you can't memorize the teleprompter.
*  You get lazy, mentally lazy.
*  You can't.
*  Then you go on the road and you're like, ugh.
*  You think you'd say it every night.
*  You memorize it.
*  You can't.
*  It's a psychological thing.
*  I know some guys who lay out sheets of paper on the floor on the stage with like bullet
*  points.
*  I've tried that.
*  Yeah.
*  It doesn't really work that well.
*  It's weird.
*  The lights are weird.
*  Yeah, but you can't even see them.
*  Do you go on stage with glasses on?
*  No.
*  That would help.
*  This is one of the first times I've been in glasses in public.
*  Really?
*  Well, I wanted people to take me seriously during the interview.
*  And it's kind of a vibe.
*  It's a vibe.
*  It's hot on chicks.
*  I don't know why.
*  Yes, I agree.
*  A girl who doesn't see that good for whatever reason.
*  For whatever reason.
*  They just seem smarter.
*  Hey, for whatever reason.
*  Yeah, there's something intense.
*  That only became in the 70s.
*  That became like a thing.
*  Suddenly girls have glasses.
*  Really?
*  Girls with glasses are hotter?
*  Yeah, they had the whole new glasses.
*  I'll tell you, certain people just look great in sunglasses.
*  The first person I noticed as a kid, one of your idols, Bruce Lee, I go, that guy looks
*  badass in sunglasses.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And he had like, they weren't completely dark.
*  They were like mixed.
*  I was like, that looks cool.
*  Yeah, he was a cool motherfucker.
*  He was a cool motherfucker.
*  Yeah, that dude changed the world.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Nobody thought about doing karate before Bruce Lee.
*  Nobody cared.
*  Well, even when he was on the Green Hornet, I'm old enough, I was there for the Green
*  Hornet days.
*  And you're like, yeah, that's kind of cool.
*  But you didn't think about it.
*  But the minute those movies came out, we all saw them.
*  When they first came out, I saw Chinese Connection, it was called Fists of Fury.
*  They changed the titles now, but it was Chinese Connection was the first one, then Fists of
*  Fury and then Enter the Dragon.
*  Those are the three big ones.
*  And it was the first time we ever saw somebody with abs.
*  Yes.
*  They're like, whoa, how cool does that look?
*  How cool does it look to be ripped?
*  Look at that.
*  Look at that.
*  Come on.
*  I mean, I hate to say it, but my profile pic when I was 19, I basically have the same physique.
*  I don't care what anyone says.
*  He kind of looks like a twink today, though.
*  Yeah, he does.
*  Well, because nobody lifted weights in those days, you know.
*  But he was he was the king.
*  Look at the abs on that motherfucker.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Today he'd be accused of having fake abs.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, he's a badass.
*  Bruce Lee gold metal sunglasses.
*  Oh, you can buy them.
*  Oh, yeah, but I don't think those are the ones I'm thinking about.
*  No, that one in that photo looks pretty cool.
*  No, it wasn't these.
*  It was some of the look where he just was casually wearing some of the.
*  Cool, dude.
*  Yeah, he was a badass.
*  He was a real super.
*  He just was a star.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, transcended.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it also was happening during that weird time, the weird time in life in the
*  70s after Vietnam was really winding down.
*  It was almost done.
*  Now we're back to 1968.
*  Yeah, we're right there right now.
*  We're in 1968.
*  We're waiting for Kent State to jump off.
*  You've seen these fucking protests that are happening in colleges.
*  Yeah.
*  These kids are all wearing masks.
*  They're outside.
*  They're protesting and they're all wearing masks.
*  I say that it's like the Democrats, Maga hat.
*  That's what the mask is.
*  Isn't it nice?
*  You're letting everybody know.
*  You're letting everybody know that you're part of the Klan, that you're on the good
*  side.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm masking and masking for your safety.
*  Yeah.
*  They're just bizarre human beings coming out of colleges today.
*  Well, I really brainwashed.
*  Yeah.
*  I say it this way.
*  It's 20 percent.
*  Let's say 20 percent of them are just, 20 percent of them are kids that were raised
*  to hate the West.
*  Everything in the West is bad.
*  They're brainwashed, which is really the whole curriculum is 20 percent of that.
*  Then I'd say 20 percent are kids that are, they're the kids that feel like they want
*  to be like when I was in college.
*  Like when I was in college, remember this is happening during finals week.
*  So 20 percent are finals protesters.
*  If somebody came up to me when I was in college and said, listen, next week is finals.
*  You know you're going to fail.
*  How about this?
*  We're going to give you some money from this.
*  George Soros is a Venmo thing.
*  Just we're going to give you money.
*  You stand outside and you block the, not only do you not have to take your finals, you're
*  going to block the kids that are going to make you look bad and pass their finals.
*  You're going to block them from coming to class.
*  I would have said, give me the scarf.
*  I'll put it on right now.
*  Then you got to 20 percent kids are going to be, they're like the ones that are peer
*  pressured by their roommates.
*  Because if you're roommates with people in college, they know your schedule.
*  So they go, hey, we're going to go protest genocide.
*  You can't say, I'm going, I was going to go to the bar.
*  So half these kids are like, god damn it, now I got to go out to the protest or I look
*  bad in front of all my roommates.
*  Have you ever seen when they get interviewed, the Constantine Kissin from Trigonometry,
*  he went to the protest and he was just asking them like, what the river to the sea, what
*  does that mean to you?
*  Asking questions.
*  Yeah.
*  What do you think should happen?
*  Like, what is what do you think the history of Palestine?
*  Yeah.
*  And now they're literally, they're literally praying.
*  They're praying to Mecca now.
*  Did you see all the footage of them?
*  Wonderful.
*  They're bowing.
*  It's like I am objectively like going to put a fatwa on my mother.
*  I just want to come out publicly and say China, Russia, you guys won.
*  You won.
*  You got our kids.
*  You got the kids.
*  You got a lot of them.
*  More of them than you didn't get.
*  No, they don't want them.
*  Listen, China, China, they're teaching kids computer engineering.
*  Law schools are teaching like, you know, state sanctioned violence in Shakespeare's sonnets
*  and you know, guys with fake eyelashes reading to toddlers.
*  Yeah, that's what it is.
*  That's what TikTok is.
*  Our TikTok is a disaster.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, they're smart.
*  I mean, they got us.
*  They got us.
*  They won.
*  They won the ideological battle.
*  They've destroyed our universities.
*  Yeah.
*  They've destroyed our faith.
*  They didn't.
*  They did.
*  They infiltrated the universities.
*  It happened way before that, in my opinion.
*  When did it happen?
*  They just went like this.
*  All they did was go like this.
*  Have you ever seen Yuri Besmanov talk about it?
*  He's a defector from the KGB.
*  He talked about it in a famous interview from 1984.
*  We talk about it way too much, so I'm sorry if you're hearing this again, folks.
*  But he basically laid out exactly what was going to happen to America in 1964.
*  1964?
*  Yep.
*  Or excuse me, 1984.
*  He was saying that Marxism and Leninist ideas have been, they've infiltrated all the universities
*  with these ideas.
*  They're teaching them to children.
*  And you have like two generations from now, you're going to be fucked.
*  Well, yeah.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  It started long before any of this.
*  China didn't say they did it.
*  He said Russia did it.
*  He said Russia was doing it.
*  So they're actively subverting our education system.
*  Because I feel like the idea of this kind of thing started long before, you know, before,
*  I mean, it's been around a long time because people are like, hey, it sounds fair.
*  Like equality sounds fair.
*  Right.
*  So then they slowly started bringing it in and people, the general narrative is if you
*  say, if I say to you right now, I'm just saying anyway, I think America is a great country.
*  People go, oh my God, do you hear this psychopath?
*  What an idiot.
*  You're a Nazi.
*  He's the dumbest person I've ever met.
*  Yeah.
*  If you start from the premise that America is evil, which is basically the premise today,
*  and everything we do is based on oppression and violence, then anybody that goes against
*  that there's something evil about them.
*  Yes.
*  So I don't think that was Russia and China doing that.
*  I think that was us doing it.
*  I think Russia and China influenced it, particularly Russia.
*  I think they just agreed.
*  They were useful idiots and all that stuff they used to talk about.
*  But I think they didn't, I didn't think they had far to go.
*  I don't think you could do it unless people wanted to go along with that.
*  Well, it's also a situation where your universities are almost entirely dedicated towards one
*  ideology.
*  That's right.
*  You don't have any, look, there's clearly over history, regardless of what you think
*  about right-wing people, clearly over history there have been brilliant conservative people.
*  And to not address that and to not have those people talk and to only allow liberal people
*  to talk or progressive people to talk, you're going to get a distorted worldview.
*  And that's what these kids are getting.
*  That's well, I mean, even just the fact that Russia and China didn't force them to stop
*  people from speaking at these places.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like that's, that's what's been going on for whatever amount of years.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're like me, you're not some right-wing guy or you know what I mean?
*  But you've been pushed into a category that people are saying you're this kind of guy
*  Because they're so far to the left and so stringent ideologically that if you fluctuate,
*  you're out of the loop.
*  And that's, that's a cult.
*  It is a cult.
*  But isn't it, it mean it's one of the beauties, one of the beautiful things about America
*  is the amount of freedom we have of expression.
*  And when you have that and you have 330 million people, you're going to have a certain percentage
*  of people that are just off the rails, insane.
*  Yes.
*  And when these people are rabid about it and excited about it, a lot of people find that
*  attractive just like a lot of people find Islam attractive.
*  And they don't just find it attractive because of the discipline and the tenants and all
*  the different things that seem to resonate with some people.
*  They find it attractive because those people are all in.
*  And you want to be in a group that's all in.
*  Like if I leave, they'll kill me.
*  That's right.
*  They'll kill you if you leave.
*  That's right.
*  But you can join.
*  You can join.
*  They'll take you in as a brother.
*  Oh, I want to join.
*  And then people just, it becomes attractive to them.
*  Because moderates are considered pussy.
*  I talk about this all the time.
*  Moderates are considered, all you can see is a bland guy in dockers with his god damn,
*  you know, with his dad bod and nobody's interested in moderates.
*  Fence sitters.
*  Fence sitters.
*  I say even in Superman, you've got Lois Lane.
*  She sees Clark Kent, nice guy.
*  He's like, hey, Lois, I want to have dinner.
*  She's like, just dinner, Clark.
*  No, all right, I'm sorry.
*  And then Superman who shows up two hours a week, who's an extremist, just breaks shit.
*  And she's like, so I'm saying we, our whole culture is built around extremists.
*  Like the hero in the movie walks away after blowing up a hydroelectric.
*  He's never the guy that troubleshoots the hydroelectric dam.
*  That should be the hero in every movie.
*  Imagine being Clark Kent and you go to deal with this lady just constantly talking up
*  Superman and talking down to you.
*  And you're like, bitch, you don't know shit.
*  Yes.
*  You just got to sit there and take it because you just can't spill the beans.
*  You want to say, hey, fucking dummy, you just take the glass off.
*  Are you stupid?
*  I'm the same guy, but just wearing glasses.
*  I tricked you with glasses.
*  I catfished you.
*  You didn't notice that I built like a fucking linebacker.
*  You didn't notice that I look like a giant super person.
*  Oh, I just have glasses on, so now I'm a loser.
*  Well, because she never slept with him, that's why she didn't notice.
*  Because she was like, Clark, lay off.
*  Do you think Clark would like show off like every now and then, like pick something up
*  you shouldn't be able to pick up?
*  Yeah, but you know, Clark's an insult.
*  Yeah, he is an insult.
*  An angry insult.
*  A handsome, angry, football quarterback looking insult.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  He's an insult.
*  Just because of the glasses.
*  Isn't that funny?
*  Like that was the only disguise he had was glasses.
*  It's the dumbest fucking disguise in all of comic books.
*  At least Batman.
*  Like maybe he had a weird face.
*  Like if he had like a cleft palate, you're like, hey, buddy.
*  I fucking, I know who you are.
*  But no, you know, you just see the little face part and the rest of the face is covered.
*  Like, okay, hides his voice.
*  I'm Batman.
*  Okay, okay, maybe.
*  But Superman, it's fucking stupid.
*  It is stupid.
*  But the, but speaking of Bruce Lee, the green hornet had a mask, but then Kato was Bruce
*  Lee.
*  We didn't realize, by the way, here's a stupid sitcom I'm watching as a little kid.
*  We didn't realize there's a lifetime legend playing the sidekick.
*  How many times does that happen?
*  Never.
*  In life.
*  But even then, but he wore this little chauffeur's outfit, if I remember correctly.
*  Bruce Lee wore like a, he was like this sidekick.
*  But he was, but even then you could see a stalker, like even as the sidekick, the two
*  scenes are like, this guy's a badass.
*  I was like five years old, six years old.
*  I'm like, look at this.
*  You know, he was supposed to be in that TV show, Kung Fu.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it was supposed to be about him.
*  It wasn't supposed to be David Carradine.
*  And why did he say no?
*  They didn't want to have a Chinese guy on TV.
*  That's insane.
*  And they picked David Carradine.
*  Yeah, but it worked.
*  The crazy thing with David Carradine is it worked.
*  It worked.
*  That show worked.
*  I loved that show.
*  I used to love that show.
*  Yeah, it was a great show.
*  Because every episode, every episode there was, although let's face it, when you really
*  look at it, it was kind of a woke show.
*  Every week it was intolerance and then David Carradine would come and save the day.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Kick some ass.
*  He always had to use violence, though.
*  But he wasn't that great of a martial arts guy.
*  Oh, he was terrible.
*  It was nonsense.
*  It was totally unbelievable.
*  But the way he was doing it was like, if you didn't know any better, you're like, oh yeah,
*  he's got magic.
*  But if Bruce Lee had done that, he would have broke not the internet, but he would have
*  broke TV, a white open.
*  Oh yeah.
*  That would have been the best show of all time.
*  If he started wheel kicking people and jumping side kicking people in the face, he'd be like,
*  whoa, it would have changed everything.
*  But the movies changed everything.
*  I mean, he broke through just because he was undeniable.
*  Oh yeah.
*  That was supposed to be him on that television show.
*  I'll tell you, all the karate studios, Jerome Mackie, these were all the karate, these were
*  big karate guys back when I was a kid, like karate teachers.
*  He opened thousands of karate studios around the country, Bruce Lee alone.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  It became a thing.
*  Bruce Lee and then Chuck Norris was how I got into martial arts.
*  Yeah, Chuck Norris fighting him.
*  Jean-Claude Van Damme watching those movies.
*  How about this name?
*  Bill Wallace.
*  You ever hear of him?
*  Yeah, Superfoot.
*  Yeah, he was a great kickboxer.
*  And it was a guy named Joe Lewis.
*  Yeah, Joe Lewis, heavyweight champion.
*  Not in boxing, but in kickboxing.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah, white guy.
*  Yeah, there was a bunch.
*  And Jim Kelly was a great fighter.
*  He was in Bruce Lee movies too.
*  Did you ever do karate or did you just follow it?
*  I mean, I did a couple of classes, but I was...
*  It's crazy that you know about all those guys like Joe Lewis.
*  How about Benny Orquidez?
*  Benny the Jet.
*  Benny the Jet, of course.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, because I always tell this, but when I was a kid, the trains were so dangerous
*  in New York.
*  Like, I mean, it was...
*  This is nothing now compared to when I was growing up.
*  But what I would do is instead of taking karate, I used to buy Karate Magazine and I'd stand
*  on the train with my legs splayed like this and stand and read my karate magazine.
*  Good move.
*  Who's going to read a karate magazine unless it's a karate...
*  Do you know Owen Smith is a comedian?
*  Yes.
*  From Baltimore.
*  I somehow mentioned that story one night to him and he goes, I took you one better.
*  He goes, I bought a karate trophy and I used to walk around the streets holding my karate
*  trophy.
*  That's hilarious.
*  So while you were studying martial arts, seriously, just remember there was a whole bunch of lazy
*  pricks that bought magazines and trophies just so we were like stolen valor.
*  People find a workaround.
*  There's a lot of dudes walked around with kung fu outfits on.
*  With the slippers, the whole black kung fu outfit, the white collar.
*  Absolutely.
*  To this day they still do.
*  And to this day I'm still like, oh, I don't know who the fuck is that guy.
*  I used to go watch them practice in the park and they were faking martial arts.
*  It was made up stuff.
*  They were doing made up things.
*  What do you mean?
*  The moves are nonsense.
*  It was made up.
*  And you knew they were made up?
*  A hundred percent.
*  Yeah.
*  A hundred percent.
*  They were doing stuff that just...
*  There's no history of this.
*  I don't study kung fu, but I understand it.
*  I know it.
*  I know what it looks like.
*  I've watched it.
*  Thousands of videos on it.
*  I've seen classes.
*  I know what kung fu is.
*  You're not doing kung fu.
*  You're fucking...
*  You're doing some shit you think looks like kung fu and you're telling people that you
*  are a master and you're practicing in the park and you've got a bunch of other dumb
*  people that have fallen you.
*  And there's a lot of that out there.
*  There was a lot...
*  Before the UFC came around, there was a lot of fake martial arts.
*  Guys who pretended they had some touch of death.
*  And their students were hypnotized.
*  They were in a cult.
*  They would touch their students.
*  Their students would fall to the ground.
*  They're still out there.
*  There's a video.
*  Absolutely.
*  There's an Instagram page, McDojoLife.
*  McDojoLife just highlights all these fake martial artists.
*  Because McDojo was like those strip mall places that open up price.
*  Which some of them are really good.
*  But, you know, this is location.
*  It depends on the teacher.
*  But this idea of like a death touch that people had like some secret powers.
*  It's the dream, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I told you I took six judo lessons as a little kid.
*  I should say before the martial arts craze.
*  And I really wish I would have stuck with judo.
*  But in those days, there was no like panic.
*  So you'd walk out of class with the worst headache of all time.
*  Oh, you're getting brain damage.
*  Yeah, you're getting brain damage.
*  You're getting brain damage in regular judo.
*  100%.
*  100%.
*  Judo's bad.
*  You get brain damage.
*  It's amazing.
*  It's amazing martial art.
*  But you get brain damage from Rod Nijetski.
*  You do?
*  Yeah.
*  My friend Mark Gordon, he specializes in traumatic brain injuries.
*  He's a doctor.
*  And he works with a lot of veterans, football players, fighters and stuff.
*  He's like everything that hits your head is bad.
*  Like soccer.
*  Guys get CTE.
*  Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.
*  The things that boxers get and football players get and MMA fighters get.
*  The soccer players get it from hitting it with their head.
*  But how do you get it from Nijetski?
*  The bouncing.
*  Just the bouncing.
*  Then how come they tell you you're supposed to go on those gymnastic, whatever that's
*  called.
*  They say that's healthy.
*  Trampolines?
*  Yeah, trampoline.
*  Yeah, I don't think that's like jolting because that's kind of like catching you and lifting
*  you up and catching you and lifting you up.
*  That's a different thing than boom, boom, boom.
*  It's the heavy duty shaking, head banging.
*  Like Angus from ACDC.
*  Gotta have brain damage.
*  Yes.
*  There's no way he doesn't.
*  Shaking your brain.
*  There's no way he doesn't.
*  That dude has to be gone.
*  But who the hell goes on a jet ski more than like once a year?
*  Let's think about that.
*  Some jet ski people.
*  I really love them.
*  Jet skis are fun.
*  Yeah, I have a jet ski.
*  I love it.
*  I've tried it.
*  It's fun.
*  But if you bounce around on waves, you're getting brain damage.
*  That's how delicate the brain is.
*  The brain is not meant to be jostled around.
*  Guys get concussions from getting hit in the chest.
*  If you get hit in the chest, your head snaps back and you get a concussion.
*  It happens all the time.
*  You don't have to get hit in the head to get a concussion.
*  Well, yeah.
*  Yeah, but that's why it's a good thing I stopped judo because every day you'd have a horrible
*  headache.
*  I was a little kid.
*  Also, these guys crashed.
*  Oh my God.
*  Well, that's different.
*  That's ski jumping.
*  That's insane.
*  I know, but this is what the article on skiing was bringing up.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's insane.
*  They hit it hard.
*  How hard they hit.
*  Oh, must be nuts.
*  They're going 30.
*  So this is a water skiing tournament.
*  Is that what that is?
*  That's what that was.
*  This is like an article about water skiers getting CTE.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Have to.
*  No doubt.
*  No doubt they have it.
*  No doubt.
*  I bet dolphins have CTE.
*  I bet they don't.
*  I bet they glide right into that water.
*  Everybody always says how smart they are.
*  I'm like, yeah, they seem really intelligent sometimes.
*  You're dismissing the intelligence of dolphins?
*  Yeah.
*  When anybody bounces a beach ball on their nose and that's their, they're the valedictorian
*  of the animal kingdom.
*  That's enough for me.
*  I think you have to do that if you're trapped in that swimming pool, if you want to get
*  fed.
*  I think you'd put up beach ball on your nose too.
*  That's the problem.
*  The problem is we're so evil, we'll take intelligent things and lock them in a swimming pool if
*  we can't understand their language.
*  Like what?
*  What?
*  I don't know what you're saying.
*  Do you want a fish or not?
*  Here's the ball, motherfucker.
*  That's what it is.
*  Out in the wild though, they're awesome.
*  They play with you.
*  They come hang out.
*  They do.
*  They jump and they literally want you to see them.
*  They play with people.
*  You can swim with them.
*  They'll save you from sharks.
*  If sharks come by, they'll fight the sharks off.
*  They save people from sharks all the time.
*  They have a cerebral cortex that's 40% larger than a human being's.
*  What?
*  Yeah, 40%.
*  They have dialects?
*  They have different dialects.
*  Like you talk with you from New York.
*  You know, I have like a little bit of Boston, a little bit of California, like all fucked
*  up.
*  They can tell from dolphins listening to their vocal patterns where they're from.
*  Now wait a minute.
*  But they can't decipher it yet, but they're hoping they can do that through AI.
*  First of all, if you don't have a routine about dolphins accents, you're crazy.
*  I'll steal it if you don't do it.
*  I had a bit about dolphins, about taking a true story.
*  It's a true story.
*  I got on very high edibles with my daughter when we went fishing and these dolphins came
*  by the boats and they were jumping up in the air.
*  And then I had this crazy thought that what if the concept of me, like we think when you
*  think of yourself as, you know, when you refer to yourself, me, you're thinking of yourself
*  living in this world with these genes and this city and this street.
*  But the thought of me, like what if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin?
*  And then I thought like, what if that's the same with all human beings?
*  Everybody's just experiencing life through different biological circumstances, different
*  life experiences.
*  But what if me is the same in every single human being just dealing with different problems?
*  No, what does that mean?
*  I don't understand what you're saying.
*  What I'm saying is that when you think of yourself, when you think Colin Quinn, like
*  when you think like, oh, I'm looking at the world, this is me.
*  That energy of what me is, this is how high I was.
*  I was on like 200 milligrams of pot edible on a boat in the middle of the ocean in Hawaii.
*  Just amazing experience.
*  But I was thinking the car like when the dolphins would jump up, they would look at you.
*  They look you in the eye and you see that they're intelligent.
*  And I was thinking like, what if I lived his life?
*  I would be him.
*  And what if he lived my life?
*  He would be me.
*  And what I think of as me is just me stumbling into a bunch of experiences with very particular
*  genetics, a very particular like life lessons that I'm carrying around.
*  And I think that's me.
*  But what if the energy of me, the very core of it is exactly the same in everybody?
*  We're just experiencing life through different circumstances, but it's the same thing.
*  That's God.
*  Yeah.
*  What about the, you know, I was thinking about when I was thinking about the whole martial
*  arts thing too, was when you think about dolphins fighting sharks or saving people from sharks,
*  that's almost a martial art too.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Well, you ever see what killer whales do to sharks?
*  No.
*  There's this video of this mother killer whale.
*  Oh yeah, they fuck everybody up.
*  There's this video of this.
*  By the way, they save people too.
*  And the only time they've ever killed people is in swimming pools.
*  They save people all the time.
*  Killer whales save people that fall in the water.
*  They save them.
*  They eat everything.
*  They kill dolphins.
*  They kill whales.
*  They kill everybody, but they don't kill people.
*  We kill them, but they don't kill us.
*  The only time they've ever killed people on record.
*  I mean, there's probably been a few circumstances where people were cunts.
*  Yeah.
*  Killer whale kills something.
*  Yeah, some asshole tried to harpoon their sister or something.
*  Sure.
*  I'm sure that happened.
*  But the point is that killer whales don't actively target people when it would be really
*  fucking easy to do.
*  So check this killer whale.
*  Fucks this shark up.
*  So she's out there with her, look at this, boom!
*  Wow.
*  She's out there with her cubs and she just puts the fucking clamp down on this great white.
*  It's pretty wild.
*  It also makes you realize how big killer sharks are.
*  Or killer whales rather.
*  Killer whales, yeah.
*  Look at that, boom!
*  Yeah.
*  I mean.
*  I just saw something the other day of a killer whale around a boat.
*  Some little boat.
*  And it was just, you could tell the guy's like, oh God, it's over for me.
*  And then the whale didn't bother him, like you said.
*  Yeah.
*  They just checked him out and left.
*  Just generally don't fuck with you.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think you can kind of talk to them.
*  I think they understand.
*  If you're like, hey!
*  You're cool.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, you know, if you're polishing up a big metal spear with a rope on the end of it,
*  then they might get a little angry.
*  They'll probably fuck you up.
*  I bet that, I bet if there have been people dying, because is this the guy?
*  Look at that little boat.
*  Deeper.
*  Oh, he got bumped.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh, it's right under me.
*  Wow.
*  Whoa.
*  You guys getting this?
*  Yes.
*  Let's do that.
*  Let's get out of here.
*  By the way.
*  But that was a gentle bump.
*  That was nothing.
*  No, this was something else.
*  But how about that?
*  Is that not the battle cry of today?
*  You guys getting this?
*  Yes.
*  It is.
*  That's the most important thing anyone could say.
*  The gram.
*  We got to get it on the gram.
*  You guys getting this?
*  Do you even have Instagram?
*  Yeah.
*  You do.
*  Sure.
*  Do you make reels?
*  Do you ever make positive?
*  Hey guys, you can really do it.
*  Push through it.
*  Well, I kind of, ironically, as you know, I've been doing that for years.
*  I'm kind of a soccer moth on social media just to infuriate people.
*  That's my whole game.
*  But I do, you know, I've been doing this series called Block by Block on YouTube, which is
*  with this guy, a homeless pimp, you know, him, Mike Lavin.
*  But we do-
*  I didn't know you were doing this.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  I have a bunch of episodes where I interview.
*  It's my little, you know, like the thing I care the most about doing, which is I interview
*  people from different neighborhoods in New York that I know over the years and then just
*  get them to tell stories about their neighborhood.
*  So I'll serve my friend from Hell's Kitchen, Mike Spillane.
*  I didn't even know this was out there.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And this is my Steve Kelly.
*  One problem with really great comics, and I include you in there, is that you guys are
*  terrible at promoting things.
*  Yeah.
*  I know.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  But it's also why the stuff you put out is so great, because you're only thinking about
*  the stuff.
*  You're not thinking about promoting the stuff, which is a totally different animal.
*  And we wouldn't know where- we would only come here.
*  Where else would we go?
*  We don't know.
*  Well, doing it yourself, like doing your own promotion or like letting people, you know,
*  getting-
*  But I just- so I interviewed this one guy, Mike Spillane from Hell's Kitchen, and they're
*  famous family over there.
*  He's telling all the stories of the old.
*  But one of the stories which you will like was him and my friend, Robert, who died, and
*  his cousin, they were in a bar, it's like 1980s, and midtown.
*  So Hell's Kitchen is connected to the theater and all the Madison Square Garden.
*  So in a bar, some guy starts with Mike Spillane, he hits him, the guy's friend grabs him around
*  his neck, it's Andre the Giant.
*  Oh my God.
*  They're in a fight with Andre the Giant.
*  Oh my God.
*  And he picks him up and flings him, and it's like a whole famous story of them fighting
*  and getting their ass kicked by Andre the Giant.
*  Oh my God.
*  And then the cops come and grab them outside and arrest them, and the cop walks in, finds
*  out what happened, sees Andre, and just walks out and laughs and goes, let him go.
*  So just finding different stories of different neighborhoods, that's my little thing for
*  you know.
*  That's back the day before Instagram where people were on snitches.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So that's all, I'm just talking to these people and finding out all the great stories.
*  That happened today, Andre would be all over the news, people would be angry at him.
*  Oh my God, everybody would have an opinion on all of it.
*  When this guy was telling the story, I go, so people must have been buying you drinks
*  for months.
*  He goes, at Hell's Kitchen that time, two weeks, and then there was some new story happening.
*  He goes, that wasn't even the story of the month.
*  What a great name for a neighborhood.
*  Hell's Kitchen, yeah.
*  What a great name.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I mean, you kind of have to act crazy if you're there.
*  And they did, yeah.
*  If you're going to move to Hell's Kitchen, that's a very specific mindset.
*  Well, now of course it's different, but it was the most, just imagine a neighborhood
*  in the middle of Times Square, when Times Square was taxi driver, so they had to deal
*  with all of that.
*  The theaters, so all the stagehands were there.
*  All the teamsters were there.
*  It was a combination of everything, all the music studio, Lincoln Center on one side,
*  all these, and in the middle is all these crazy Irish guys and Puerto Ricans.
*  Just so, and so much music and so much stuff came out of that area.
*  It's crazy.
*  It really is, when you really think about it.
*  It's a really wild, wild, the center of the universe they used to call it.
*  And for how long, like 20 years?
*  Like 50, 60.
*  50, 60?
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  It was that hot for that many years?
*  Well, hot in what way?
*  I mean, it was Times Square.
*  I mean, like the interesting aspect of it.
*  The interesting aspect, I bet, was 40, 50 years.
*  I would say from 1950 to 2000.
*  What killed it?
*  Giuliani?
*  No, it just became, well, it became Times Square.
*  You're talking Times Square?
*  Times Square became gentrified.
*  Giuliani, yeah, gentrified, and people started to-
*  Corporatize is a better word, right?
*  It's like it became Applebee's.
*  But it did.
*  It's disappointing, but at the same time it was Santa Monica Mall.
*  It was very bad.
*  It was very bad when I first went there.
*  When I was living in Boston, I came to New York for a karate tournament, ironically,
*  in like 82, 83, I think.
*  So I was in high school, so probably 83.
*  And I was like, this is nuts.
*  Like this place is fucking nuts.
*  It was nuts.
*  It was nuts.
*  It was like all peep shows and pimps and hookers.
*  Yes.
*  It looked black and white.
*  Like, you could tell it was like in color.
*  Yes.
*  Like everything looked black and white.
*  It looked dirty and seedy, and there was just junkies on the street, and people with like
*  long coats and people yelling at people.
*  And you're like, yo, this place is nuts.
*  Times Square was a place that everybody avoided.
*  That's right.
*  Somehow or another, Times Square became a tourist trap.
*  Well because of Giuliani.
*  Giuliani cleaned up the peep show.
*  There was a law, I guess, where you couldn't have, you had to have like 30% legitimate
*  in your peep show.
*  There was some law that happened where they covered all the peep shows.
*  30% legitimate?
*  What does that mean?
*  30% like a regular store.
*  Like you couldn't just have all the porn.
*  Some obscure law.
*  I don't know what it was.
*  Yeah, so Joey DeRosa sandwiches.
*  But that's basically what they did do.
*  They had to have a legitimate thing and then the porn in the back or something.
*  Oh God.
*  And that was in the mid-90s, and then it got cleaned.
*  Well they used to have the triple X movie theaters.
*  You know, you want to talk about the lowest class of human being that you could possibly
*  encounter in public.
*  Guys going to jerk off in a room with other guys jerking off watching a movie.
*  Yeah.
*  Of course.
*  Just the most degenerate humans available.
*  And it was in Times Square too.
*  It was all over the place.
*  No, no, the whole country had those.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Every city had, Times Square just had 50 of them.
*  Well the craziest story.
*  Everybody else had one.
*  The craziest story is Deep Throat.
*  Deep Throat they were trying to turn it into.
*  So the country was so naive back then.
*  And porn, you didn't have VCRs, so you didn't, the idea of a porn addiction seemed ridiculous
*  to people.
*  So what they did with Deep Throat is they made a cinematic movie that was a porn film
*  and all these stars went to go see it.
*  Like Johnny Carson was there in line, they were interviewing them, where they're going
*  to see a porn film.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's only like 1970 something.
*  72 or something like that.
*  And couples would go all over the country and go to these sleazy theaters and watch
*  Deep Throat.
*  Wild.
*  They weren't even sleazy theaters.
*  These were regular theaters that showed Deep Throat.
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  People are so, that's so interesting, like you think about how much porn, like right
*  now porn is what percentage of the internet, Jamie?
*  Is it 30 something percent?
*  It's like 30 something percent of all internet traffic, all of it, all of the world is porn.
*  That's crazy.
*  It didn't even exist before Deep Throat.
*  No.
*  Like you had stag films that you would hear about.
*  Yeah, my brother-in-law was getting married.
*  Yes.
*  Went to a stag party and they showed a movie.
*  Like grainy movie of this like sad heroin addict fucking these guys.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  Whoa.
*  That was gross.
*  Yeah.
*  The mafia.
*  The mafia.
*  I know.
*  Exactly.
*  But it's so funny because I remember Deep Throat was the big breakthrough.
*  First it was the devil and Miss Jones.
*  I was like 11 or 12 and I remember we'd laugh about it.
*  We didn't know what we were laughing at.
*  And then next year, you know, we're like 19, 18, 19, we're going up Times Square at
*  Point.
*  And you know, we were right there.
*  You just take the train, you're right there.
*  But it was so psychotic that, and I actually knew, I knew a girl that ended up going into
*  like working in those Times Square booths and I'm sure a lot of people did, but it was
*  really crazy to me that she was doing that.
*  Wow.
*  That is crazy.
*  That's a commitment.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there's still booths and guys.
*  That lifestyle.
*  Oof.
*  There's a judge.
*  A judge in New York made it a $3 million fine for showing Deep Throat in a theater.
*  Wow.
*  It still exists.
*  It's never been overturned apparently.
*  Wow.
*  Whenever this article was written.
*  Well, this is in 93, but.
*  Wow.
*  He's in television have completely changed our outlook on the human form.
*  So he was 71 at the time when he was talking about this.
*  And so this is on the eve of his retirement in 91.
*  So he's probably in his 50s when that happened.
*  So he'd grown his whole life, been a grown adult and never had any interaction with porn.
*  And then he sees people going to see it in a theater.
*  He's probably like, what the fuck is going on?
*  Yeah.
*  This is crazy.
*  Like you guys are watching people suck dicks with your friends.
*  This is weird.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It was totally legitimate for a couple of years.
*  I don't know when it turned, but I remember when I went to college, they showed Deep Throat
*  or one of these Debbie Dubs Dallas, one of these porn movies in like the student union.
*  What?
*  And guys and girls all went to see it.
*  No way.
*  Yeah.
*  It was totally, you know what I mean?
*  And there were a couple of.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  And there were a couple of girls that like, this is anti-women.
*  And we're like, oh, relax.
*  Why are you making a big deal?
*  We act like we're crazy.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  And people would just go.
*  They like, they showed it like a whole week.
*  I'll tell you another one.
*  What?
*  A week?
*  Yeah.
*  Like every night.
*  Cause so many people want to go see.
*  I'll tell you another one.
*  One of the guest speakers.
*  Talk about college gigs.
*  Harry Reams was one of the guest speakers.
*  The porn star.
*  The porn star.
*  Famous like 1980s porn star.
*  70s.
*  Yeah.
*  70s?
*  Yeah.
*  The big mustache.
*  70s mustache.
*  Do you grow on to be like a giant real estate guy?
*  I'd like to talk to him someday because this girl I knew, I still have my birthday, but
*  I'll leave it out.
*  And she drove him.
*  She goes, yeah, I drove him back to the train station.
*  And I was like, you don't need to drive him to the train station.
*  You can walk there.
*  She drove him.
*  And I want to know what happened.
*  I want the full story.
*  She's not going to give it to you.
*  She lied to me.
*  She goes, nothing happened.
*  She got turned on.
*  She got turned on by seeing that guy's dick.
*  She got turned on by his dick.
*  And I'd like to speak.
*  Also, it didn't, it wasn't like forbidden back then.
*  This is so hard for people to imagine because like today, if you're watching porn on your
*  phone and someone catches you, you have a deep shame.
*  Yes.
*  Oh, you call me watching porn.
*  Porn is a thing that people are ashamed that they consume.
*  But back then, that was not the case.
*  It was innocent in the weirdest sense where people just didn't get it.
*  They didn't get it.
*  No.
*  Like when I was a kid, VCRs were invented.
*  And one of the first things when they invented VCRs is they start making dirty movies and
*  putting them on VCRs.
*  And the porn industry just explodes.
*  It's all from people watching at home.
*  And you'd have to go through these fucking saloon doors, remember, or you'd push the
*  beads aside.
*  There was always something you had to do.
*  You couldn't just go to the porn section.
*  You had to let everybody know, hey, you fucking pervert, make some noise, rattle those beads.
*  And then you walk in there and no one was looking at anybody.
*  Everybody was like, that's right.
*  Everybody was embarrassed that they're in there with other people.
*  Maybe your neighbors.
*  That's right.
*  Jobs over there looking at the fucking hardcore section.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  That's what it was.
*  People were like, I'll be in the porn, but that section is for perverts.
*  That was the thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And it became a thing where people weren't embarrassed by it.
*  It was weird.
*  And then slowly over time, it became embarrassing.
*  I think when it became an addiction thing, I think clearly when the internet came around
*  and people had instantaneous access to it.
*  Well, it's funny because as much as sex became more like, I remember in comedy, we all had
*  bits on jerking off to porn in the 80s.
*  Right.
*  We all had bits about it.
*  It was a new thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is hard to imagine for people to see.
*  And everyone's like, ha ha ha.
*  Nobody gave a damn.
*  I mean, is that weird?
*  We all just talked about, hey, Jericho, you ever see porn?
*  Because it was new, like you said.
*  And then suddenly people stopped talking about that because it was shameful.
*  I don't know what the, I guess it was when it was.
*  It's the addiction.
*  Yeah, I guess so.
*  When you're ashamed of something, you shouldn't be doing that something almost always.
*  Right.
*  If you have to lie about the thing.
*  Right.
*  You know, like I had a friend and he was always trying to lose weight.
*  And one time we said, hey, meet us at this bar.
*  It's Ralphie May.
*  Let's say it.
*  Yeah.
*  Because he's not with us anymore.
*  I love Ralphie.
*  Great guy.
*  He was awesome.
*  Great.
*  And Ralphie was like, it was like an hour and a half later, like where the fuck is Ralphie?
*  Like he hasn't, when's he coming here?
*  And then finally he pulls up and the back of his car was just filled with fast food stuff.
*  And he had like some story about why he couldn't make it.
*  He went to a drive-thru.
*  He had to.
*  He went through a drive-thru and he bought bags of food and he just stuffed himself.
*  And he probably felt shitty about it and didn't want to talk about it.
*  Sure.
*  That's addiction.
*  That's addiction.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's the same thing.
*  If you're watching porn on your phone all the time, you're like, do you watch porn on
*  your phone?
*  Like, no, I don't watch that.
*  Because you're addicted.
*  Right.
*  You're ashamed.
*  Sure.
*  You're ashamed.
*  But like you said, 30% is crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  Is that what the number is?
*  Do we find out what the amount of traffic?
*  I'm looking to like the golden age of porn ended in 84, it says.
*  The golden age.
*  That's what this is called.
*  And I'll tell you why, AIDS.
*  Well, this VCR is also so it stopped being, you didn't have to go to the movie theater
*  to see it.
*  You could watch that home.
*  Well, that was a great, that was, oh, 84 is when the VCR came out?
*  Wow.
*  Around then, around then.
*  Yeah.
*  So that makes sense because I was in high school.
*  That makes sense.
*  There was a great scene in Boogie Nights when Burt Reynolds is so disgusted that he has
*  to do like amateur porn, remember?
*  Like he used to be a filmmaker.
*  Oh, right.
*  And then suddenly they're in the limo and he's going, okay, do that.
*  And then they, remember he was like so horrified by it all.
*  I forgot.
*  I forgot that movie.
*  That was a great movie.
*  Great movie.
*  And they said Burt Reynolds, you know, the director and all these people said Burt Reynolds
*  was so horrible.
*  Horrible.
*  He was so brilliant in it.
*  He didn't want to be in it from day one.
*  He hated everything about it.
*  Really?
*  And to his dying day, he hated it.
*  He wanted, he fired his agent.
*  He hated it.
*  And he was so brilliant in it.
*  Well, Burt Reynolds, I'm a huge Burt Reynolds fan.
*  No, the greatest.
*  I love that guy.
*  He was so fun.
*  He made me believe that like a handsome man could be funny.
*  Yeah.
*  I never thought handsome people were funny.
*  Like the handsome guy was never cool.
*  The handsome guy was like cool but silent.
*  Like maybe he wins a street fight.
*  Burt Reynolds is like always smiling.
*  It's like I want to hang out with that guy.
*  He was a party.
*  He'd go on the Tonight Show with that big laugh.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe he had that giant laugh.
*  He was the first guy that I ever really saw that was like a really handsome man that was
*  hilarious.
*  And he was best friends with Dom DeLuis.
*  Yes.
*  And they'd be on.
*  It was incredible.
*  How about when he did Jackie Gleason?
*  Jackie Gleason in him with Smokey and the Bandit?
*  What a combination.
*  Jackie Gleason and Burt Reynolds.
*  Jackie Gleason in that movie.
*  And I'll tell you who else because I remember when I saw Caddyshack for the first time and
*  I was like a young kid and I'm like oh Caddyshack my heroes are in it.
*  Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, all these cool guys, even Rodney.
*  And I go and then they got this guy from a sitcom, Ted Knight, and then he steals the
*  movie.
*  And the same thing happened with Jackie Gleason and Smokey and the Bandit.
*  These guys stole.
*  They were so good.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  Jackie Gleason was the fucking man.
*  Yeah.
*  Jackie Gleason was the man.
*  It was unbelievable.
*  He was serious acting too.
*  He was in The Hustler.
*  Oh yeah, he was amazing.
*  He was great in The Hustler.
*  Did you ever hear they said some reviewer, some famous, back when reviewers were famous,
*  goes I just, it was Laurence Olivier and him did a movie together.
*  He goes I just watched a movie with the greatest living actor and Laurence Olivier.
*  Jackie Gleason is so good.
*  He was awesome.
*  Best pool player to ever be a movie star by far.
*  Yeah.
*  He was like a real good pool player.
*  Like a professional level pool player.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You could see even the way he played.
*  Yeah, in The Hustler.
*  He was making his own shots.
*  When Paul Newell would make his shots he'd be like ugh.
*  This is not real.
*  This is nonsense.
*  But when Jackie Gleason did this, a fluidity to the way he moves around.
*  But now why would you remake The Hustler?
*  Look we all love Martin Scorsese.
*  No one's made it.
*  That was The Color of Money.
*  He did do it.
*  Color of Money.
*  No, The Color of Money was a separate book.
*  Well it was a sequel but even so.
*  But it's the same, it was the same author.
*  It left a bad taste in my mouth.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh it was a great movie too.
*  It's a great movie too.
*  Very accurate too.
*  Remember he did the flipping the pool cue.
*  That's a little nonsense.
*  People don't do that.
*  Especially not with the Balabushka.
*  But what he was doing in the movie like portraying how people hustle and move around, that was
*  all real.
*  And it's by the same guy who also wrote The Queen's Gambit.
*  Did you ever see that show on Netflix?
*  Yeah, it's a great show.
*  Amazing show.
*  Amazing show.
*  About that girl who's a wizard chess player.
*  Yeah.
*  Well that's the same guy.
*  Walter Tevis, right?
*  Is that his name?
*  Yeah, he wrote The Hustler.
*  How like compelling is her face and her energy?
*  Oh yeah, you buy it all in.
*  Whatever, you just buy it.
*  Yeah, you buy all of it.
*  You're really there with her.
*  She was awesome.
*  She's really good.
*  What is her name?
*  Anna Joy?
*  What is her name?
*  I'll never know.
*  Anna Taylor Joy.
*  I like the fact that at least he bothered.
*  That's one thing about Tom Cruise, he doesn't play games.
*  He's in the color money.
*  He learns to do like nunchucks.
*  By the way, nunchucks were big when I was a kid.
*  Nunchucks just came out when I was a kid.
*  And people would have nunchucks, everybody would walk around with black eyes because nobody
*  knew how to use them.
*  You just saw it in the movie.
*  There was no YouTube tutorials.
*  And even the teachers, the martial arts teachers didn't know what they were.
*  So the kids would walk around, everybody had a black eye for like a long time.
*  Yeah, I banged myself in the back of the head multiple times.
*  Yeah, you did.
*  The back of my head.
*  Crack.
*  Now when you did this karate tournament in the 80s in New York, are you guys striking
*  each other?
*  Wow.
*  And it's full contact like they call it?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, the karate tournament that I went to in New York was called a point tournament.
*  Point tournaments were different than taekwondo tournaments in that there wasn't continuous
*  action.
*  You'd hit the person and they would stop and call point.
*  So it's almost like this really high level game of tag.
*  Right.
*  Wasn't really the thing that I did.
*  I did taekwondo tournaments primarily, which were like continuous action and you would
*  win by knockout a lot of times.
*  So you're basically just trying to kick this other dude in the face or in the chest as
*  hard as possible and stop his body from working right.
*  That was my objective.
*  It was like the kumite.
*  Yeah, it was like that a little bit.
*  In taekwondo tournaments, you couldn't punch to the face.
*  You could only kick to the face and kick to the body.
*  And then I would transition from that into kickboxing.
*  But it was like when I went to New York City, we were trying to do anything.
*  We would try anything.
*  We would.
*  There wasn't that many tournaments.
*  So if there was no taekwondo tournaments, we would enter into karate tournaments.
*  I fought like probably.
*  I probably fought a hundred times.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And was there a magic if I counted all the tournaments, because oftentimes you'd fight
*  three or four times in a day.
*  No kidding.
*  Yeah.
*  In my last kickboxing fight was the third fight of the day.
*  I had three fights in one day.
*  I won the first two fights and I lost the last one.
*  Wow.
*  In a day.
*  That's crazy.
*  It's good to be a kid.
*  It was good to be stupid.
*  Yeah.
*  If I had a kid today and say, hey, you're not fighting again, you just get hit in the
*  head.
*  And do you come home covered in bruises all the time?
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I always came home from training and bruises.
*  Yeah.
*  And from fighting.
*  Yeah.
*  You get fucked up.
*  Yeah.
*  You get black.
*  I always had black eyes.
*  I broke my nose.
*  I don't know.
*  I probably 20 times.
*  I had to get it fixed.
*  Wow.
*  I had to get the inside of it all cleaned up and it all calcified like a wrestler's ear.
*  Wow.
*  You know wrestlers get calcium?
*  Yeah, of course.
*  You get smashed in the nose enough.
*  What happens is the inside of your nose, all that tissue swells up and bleeds and then
*  it gets broken and your septum gets twisted and blocks off.
*  And then you get like calcium deposits inside your nose.
*  Sure.
*  Just like you get in your ears.
*  Like a cave.
*  Like a little like rocks.
*  Like tights.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it was horrible.
*  I couldn't breathe at all.
*  I had a very nasal voice for a long time until I got it fixed.
*  And it was like 40 when I got it fixed.
*  Because I kept breaking it.
*  Because I was like, I'm just going to keep breaking it.
*  It's like, what am I going to do?
*  Like I broke it like three times when I was on news radio.
*  You did?
*  Yeah.
*  I was always breaking it.
*  Sparring or just rolling.
*  You accidentally get a knee to your face and then your nose is bleeding.
*  You're like, well, I broke it again.
*  And were you working out with like Benny the Jet and those guys in the valley?
*  I actually started at the Jet Center when I first moved to Hollywood.
*  That was the first place I went to.
*  That's great.
*  It was like just two places I wanted to go to when I went to Hollywood.
*  I wanted to go to the Comedy Store and I wanted to go to the Jet Center in Van Nuys.
*  I found out about it.
*  I was like, it's the Jet Center.
*  I can't believe it's real.
*  And when I was there, Blinky Rodriguez, who is Benny's brother-in-law, amazing fighter
*  too, like a great, great kickboxer, he had lost, I believe, a family member to gang violence.
*  I don't want to say exactly who it was because I'm not sure if I remember.
*  I want to say a son to gang violence.
*  And then if it's not that, I apologize.
*  He offered free classes to gang members.
*  So he wanted to teach these gang members discipline, give them a sense of community, and give them
*  structure, give them something.
*  So I was taking kickboxing classes with gang bangers.
*  I moved from New York and I came to LA.
*  I didn't have any friends.
*  And here I am in my Volkswagen Corrado pulling up to the Jet Center in Van Nuys.
*  And I'm taking kickboxing classes with gang bangers.
*  Like this guy had this fucking tattoo on his back, this homemade tattoo, of the name of
*  his gang.
*  It was like, Platos.
*  And then underneath it, it said, fuck the rest.
*  I was like, oh boy.
*  This is 1994.
*  This dude's back has his gang and then fuck the rest.
*  I was like, yo, what am I doing?
*  So I had to spar with these guys.
*  So I was sparring with these gang bangers.
*  They didn't know what they were doing, like a lot of them.
*  But I wouldn't hurt them.
*  I'm like, I'm not going to hurt this guy.
*  I'm just going to touch him a little bit.
*  I'm just going to give him a little face.
*  Put a foot in his face.
*  I'm not going to hurt him.
*  I do not want to get shot in the parking lot.
*  You cannot humiliate one of these guys.
*  So you just move around, be defensive with eight swing punches, just work on blocks,
*  work on moving, footwork, touch him a little bit.
*  But there's no going after him.
*  It was scary.
*  It was fucking scary.
*  These guys were murderers.
*  Ben Nives was a rough area by the 90s.
*  Super rough.
*  It was super rough.
*  But a lot of great kickboxers were there, too.
*  It was also like Pete Sugarfoot Cunningham was there.
*  And Blinky was there teaching classes, which to me was like as a kid who grew up watching
*  him on TV to be in their gym.
*  I was like, holy shit, this is crazy.
*  But then unfortunately, the earthquake fucked up the roof.
*  And when it rained, when the rainy season came, the whole building got destroyed.
*  The roof was all fucked up.
*  Oh, you were there for the earthquake.
*  I was there right after the earthquake.
*  And then the rain came after that and their building was fucked.
*  So eventually opened up a place in North Hollywood and I went there for a while, but it was just
*  Benny.
*  It was a smaller place.
*  I went to I was in L.A. during the earthquake during that 94 earthquake.
*  And I was staying in this like temporary housing place on on what it was across from Northridge,
*  but it was like in Westwood District.
*  And I wake up and I go, oh, my God, I'm dreaming that my bed is flying across this entire room.
*  Oh, my God.
*  My bed flew across the room.
*  And it was it was scary, man.
*  Oh, my God.
*  But buildings were collapsed all around me.
*  People in the street 5 a.m. in their underwear, the whole city, the whole neighborhood.
*  I was only in a small earthquake.
*  I was in a five point five and I was in my apartment in North Hollywood.
*  And it was like I was in a washing machine box or refrigerator box where it just had
*  no stability.
*  Like the whole I was like, what?
*  I thought an earthquake could be like everything shaking.
*  Everything moved.
*  Everything moved.
*  It moved side to side.
*  And I remember thinking, oh, shit.
*  It's like having vertigo.
*  But it was it was I was just thinking this is a baby one.
*  This is like a five.
*  Yeah.
*  So a seven is how many times greater than this?
*  Holy shit.
*  Yeah, it fucked up Northridge and Van Nuys got fucked.
*  That was more than any place.
*  Another reason why I was glad I got out of LA in time.
*  I'm like, it's coming.
*  Well, if you guys think you got it bad now, all the shit in the streets and all the tents
*  and wait till an earthquake hits that mess.
*  Well, about two weeks ago, I was in New York and I go, oh, what the hell was that?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And it was an earthquake.
*  Yeah.
*  Earthquake in New York.
*  It was crazy.
*  That's so unusual.
*  Yeah, I never even heard of it.
*  So this earthquake in Van Nuys, I guess it fucked up the roof of that building.
*  And it condemned a lot of buildings.
*  It destroyed a lot.
*  It destroyed that whole area.
*  Northridge is right next to Van Nuys.
*  Yeah, it just the place flooded.
*  There's a photo of me, Jamie.
*  There's a photo of me, like a black and white photo of me from a long time ago throwing
*  punches and it was taken at the Jet Center.
*  The original Jet Center?
*  Yeah.
*  It was like 1994.
*  There's like this photo of me.
*  I was ripped.
*  I was young and healthy back then.
*  Great, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Back in the old days.
*  I had most of my hair.
*  It's crazy, right?
*  Yeah.
*  That's it.
*  Whoa!
*  That's me at the Jet Center in 1994.
*  Shit.
*  You're like Sean Connery.
*  I don't know what's going on with my lips, but I was in the middle of throwing punches.
*  And you used to go there all the time, huh?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, and they had a photographer there one day.
*  And when did you pass at the Comedy Store?
*  94.
*  You passed right away?
*  No, like six months.
*  Mitzi?
*  Yeah, Mitzi gave me six months.
*  She didn't like that I was already on a TV show.
*  Oh, you were already on the show?
*  Yeah, I was already on news radio.
*  She didn't like that.
*  Oh, that's why you went out to LA?
*  Yeah, I went out to LA just for news radio.
*  I had no interest in acting.
*  I was purely being a prostitute.
*  I was just willing to go out and act for money.
*  But what a great first thing to be on.
*  Yeah, all I cared about was stand-up.
*  I just wanted to stand up.
*  And then I was like, okay, maybe this is my career now.
*  Okay, maybe I'm acting now.
*  And then all of a sudden I'm doing this stuff.
*  And I was like, this is weird.
*  I had no acting classes before I was on TV.
*  You didn't?
*  No, nothing.
*  When I got a development deal with Disney,
*  they made me get an acting coach.
*  So I did a couple of one-on-ones with this lady,
*  and I didn't like it.
*  There was a lot of weird ego stuff going on.
*  And she also wanted to be my mom in the show.
*  There was a lot of weird stuff.
*  Oh, yeah, of course.
*  But it's just like that world was not interesting in that world.
*  And I was like, this is not...
*  I'm just going to do my best.
*  I'm just going to do it the way I would do it,
*  which is pretend.
*  Pretend this is actually happening.
*  Pretend I'm this dumb guy.
*  Pretend this is actually happening.
*  But I didn't know what I was doing.
*  I didn't know where Upstage was.
*  I was on television.
*  They were like, Joe, could you move six inches Upstage?
*  I'm like, which way is that?
*  Which way is Upstage?
*  It's flat.
*  But I didn't know that old stages used to be slanted,
*  and Upstage meant you move backwards, which is kind of crazy.
*  Instead of saying, would you step back, move Upstage.
*  Like everybody's using these old timey terms for a slanted stage
*  so that the whole audience who's seated there could see everything
*  because they did it in front of a live crowd.
*  But that must have been fun doing it in front of a live crowd.
*  It was fun.
*  It was fun when you got good lines, but you didn't really get to control...
*  Like the first show that I did was terrible.
*  It was called Hardball.
*  That's what I came out to LA for.
*  I think I remember this.
*  It was a baseball show.
*  So that got canceled, and then I got lucky that I had a development deal
*  with NBC right after that, and I was going to do my own show.
*  But they said, hey, we got a part on this show that we're already going to do,
*  and we're going to recast it.
*  So it was originally Ray Romano.
*  I know.
*  Yeah, so Ray got fired, and then they replaced it with a guy,
*  and that guy got fired, and they replaced it with me,
*  which made me feel better, because at least I didn't take the job from Ray.
*  I took the job from some guy.
*  Even if you did, Ray obviously stunk, and he just got what he deserved.
*  Well, it was the best thing that happened to him,
*  because then he went and does everything that was Ray's.
*  But I love Ray, and so it was weird.
*  It was weird, but it was okay, because the other guy got the job first.
*  And then all of a sudden I'm on this fucking show with Phil Hartman
*  and Andy Dick and Dave Foley.
*  I'm like, this is crazy.
*  I've been acting for all of four months ever.
*  I did one terrible TV show, two acting classes.
*  And how long were you doing stand-up at that time?
*  Six years.
*  So that was good.
*  You were in the game.
*  I was in the game, but I wasn't that good yet.
*  Like you said, you work with Phil Hartman.
*  Phil Hartman is one of the legends of all time.
*  He was a sweetheart, too.
*  What a great guy.
*  He was a great guy.
*  A genuinely interesting, weird guy.
*  I don't know anybody like him.
*  I mean, he did the Crosby-Sills-Nayesh album art.
*  He was an artist.
*  We have one of his albums out here.
*  Isn't it crazy that he was an artist?
*  Yeah, he was a brilliant artist.
*  He was also a pilot.
*  When I bought my house in the Valley, he took me to these areas when his plane took me over
*  to show me areas where he could move to.
*  He was living in Encino.
*  And I think I was still in Encino at the time, too.
*  And I was like, I had had a stalker.
*  And so I really, I've like, I got to get a little further out.
*  You know, this is like, this is too, just people knowing where you live things is too weird.
*  I got to go to a place that's more secure.
*  And so then when I moved out to the Valley, Phil took me out there on his plane to show me areas.
*  When you're flying over these places, you see all these trees and the hills and the mountains.
*  I was like, oh, this is beautiful.
*  I'm going to live here and just drive in.
*  That's way better.
*  It's great.
*  Yeah.
*  And you guys were in Burbank?
*  We did it in a bunch of different places.
*  We did it at CVS Radford for a while.
*  That's the best location.
*  Sunset Gower.
*  We did it for the most.
*  I love it there.
*  Yeah.
*  Radford's great.
*  Great lot.
*  Jerry's Deli and everything's right nearby.
*  Jerry's Deli's gone.
*  It is?
*  I think it is.
*  All of them are gone.
*  I think it is.
*  I know the one in the Valley in Woodland Hills is gone.
*  That was a bummer, man.
*  That was fun.
*  Oh, that place was so good.
*  In the 90s, I was just talking about LA in the 90s, how you could drive around to Jeff.
*  Traffic was nothing.
*  Now you can't move.
*  Yeah.
*  Overpopulation in cities makes it way more tense.
*  Yeah.
*  People are way more tense now than they were in the 90s.
*  It was a way more relaxed city.
*  That's hard to believe because everybody in their head is like, LA's like beep, beep, fuck you.
*  Everybody's doing coke and on their way to a business meeting.
*  Back then, it was like you could get to work in a half an hour.
*  It wasn't that big a deal.
*  It was a big deal.
*  Now it's the fucking, where I used to live in the Valley, if I wanted to go to the comedy store,
*  the comedy store is 22 miles from my house.
*  It would take me 22-ish, I'm guessing, but it would take me hour, 10 minutes, hour and 10 minutes at 7 o'clock.
*  Now if I try to leave at 5, it's two hours.
*  I need two hours.
*  If I have a meeting in Hollywood at 5, I have to leave my house by 3 or I'm fucked.
*  That's crazy.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  That's two hours to go 22 miles.
*  And that's normal.
*  And that ain't even Long Island.
*  How about people making it into the city in the daytime?
*  You ever get stuck in that mess?
*  Sure.
*  People coming from the island and going across the fucking bridge?
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  It's crazy.
*  You just want to jump off the bridge.
*  And guys do it every day just so they can have a lawn.
*  Every day.
*  Every day.
*  Just so they can have a lawn.
*  Yeah.
*  Just exhausted.
*  Well, it's also taxes a little, I'm sure.
*  Taxes.
*  But also you want a backyard.
*  I want a backyard.
*  And when Saturday comes along, I want to sit with a cup of coffee on the fucking porch and
*  see a deer maybe.
*  That's right.
*  You know?
*  Let me fucking relax a little bit.
*  Relax.
*  Do I really have to be a part of that fucking concrete horse shit?
*  Yeah.
*  Because there's something about living in the concrete horse shit that some people love.
*  I love it.
*  They love it.
*  I love it.
*  Yeah.
*  You love the energy, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Just all the people around you.
*  Everything's happening.
*  I like to, yeah.
*  I'm just so used to it.
*  It's my whole, yeah.
*  I mean, but I liked LA.
*  When I lived in LA, I loved LA.
*  But I lived all over LA.
*  But, you know, and I like driving.
*  But that's the thing.
*  In LA, you just have to be in love with your car.
*  If you love your car, you love LA.
*  If you don't love your car, you don't love LA.
*  That's a good point.
*  That's a good point.
*  And in LA, the problem though, if you're fucking around with like a Tesla with 30% power, you
*  left and it's 3 p.m.
*  Like, oh, buddy, you might be fucked.
*  You might be like really fucked.
*  Like you might be, your car might die on this road.
*  You're fucked.
*  Yeah, you're fucked.
*  You got to drive two hours.
*  You got to drive to San Diego.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  You can't drive to San Diego.
*  No.
*  It's going to be five hours.
*  They say all the people that commute to LA now, like they don't just carpool.
*  They apartment pool.
*  So they don't go home.
*  They go to work Monday.
*  They stay till Friday and then they go home.
*  That is so insane.
*  That's so insane.
*  They have to rent an apartment together.
*  I have to stop saying nice things about Austin.
*  Stop saying nice things about it?
*  Yeah.
*  There's too many construction cranes.
*  Oh, I know.
*  It's great.
*  It's not just me, obviously.
*  It just started the other day.
*  But there's so many companies moved here.
*  Yeah.
*  There's just so much shit going on here.
*  So I don't want this to become like that.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's something about Texas, though, that rebels, that will always rebel.
*  And they realize how bad people fucked it up in California.
*  And hopefully the people that moved here realize how bad they fucked it up.
*  Well, they've always been.
*  Yeah.
*  They've always had one foot out of the country, Texas.
*  Let's face it.
*  They came in.
*  Came in real late.
*  Reluctantly.
*  Yeah.
*  And they've been here reluctantly.
*  They got one foot out.
*  Yeah.
*  They're like, we don't need, we'll leave.
*  Well, what do you know about the history of this country?
*  This land, this area?
*  I mean, this is a brutal, brutal place.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, you ever read The Empire of the Summer Moon?
*  No.
*  Oh my God, I get it to you.
*  You got to read it.
*  It's incredible.
*  It's a history of this place.
*  It's the Comanche Indians and the history of the Texas Rangers.
*  The Comanche Indians, yeah.
*  I like that.
*  The madness.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, clearly, what the colonizers did, what the people moved here, what they did
*  was horrible.
*  No one has ever denied that.
*  But if you don't know what the Comanches were doing to other Indians, if you don't know
*  what these raiding parties would do.
*  Of course.
*  They did some of the wildest shit.
*  They would start a bonfire, and right before they threw the guy on the bonfire, they would
*  hold him out by his arms and legs, hack off his arms and his legs while he's still alive,
*  and throw him on the fire to watch him squirm like a worm.
*  Unbelievable.
*  They would feed people, their friends.
*  They would cut people to pieces in front of you.
*  No one surrendered ever.
*  You always fought to the death, because if you were captured, you were 100% going to
*  get tortured and killed.
*  Tortured, yeah.
*  Tortured and killed.
*  For no, just because that's what they do.
*  For fun.
*  There was no prisoners of war.
*  There was no honor.
*  There was none of this European bullshit.
*  They were doing it old school.
*  Old school.
*  And that was the entire country, except for the agriculture.
*  There's a lot of people that accepted agriculture in the southeast, and they were calmer and
*  not war-bearing.
*  They weren't even riding horses a lot.
*  The Comanches were the horse-bearing ones.
*  They were the best with horses, and they were the most fierce, and they only ate meat, so
*  they could go for days without food, unlike some of the settlers.
*  Some of the people that were trying to make it across, and some of the people that they
*  fought.
*  What about, I've been reading this book, speaking of cruelty, Jerusalem.
*  It's about the history of Jerusalem.
*  The early sieges and the same torture techniques, but you know who gave it to me?
*  This guy.
*  Do you know Kevin Fitzgerald?
*  Yes.
*  Comedian, but he's a bodyguard for the Rolling Stones?
*  Yeah.
*  I just worked with him last week, and he was just telling me the Stone stories.
*  He was bodyguard for 20 years for the Stones.
*  He tells the greatest, because he's a very intelligent guy, but he was a boxer, then
*  became a bodyguard for the Stones, and then moved on and started to do stand-up.
*  He's also got like doctorates in veterinary medicine, but he started telling me, do you
*  ever hear this one about Mick Jagger, about the people in wheelchairs?
*  Because you know, you just feel like, oh, Keith was the cool guy, Mick was the good
*  guy.
*  Every day, every show for 20 years, would take this guy, Kevin, put on a hoodie so nobody
*  could recognize him, go up, because in those days they put the wheelchairs in a, if you
*  were in a wheelchair, they wouldn't let you be with your friends.
*  They'd put you in a separate wheelchair section in the balcony.
*  Everybody in a wheelchair had to go.
*  Mick Jagger would go up with eight tracks T-shirts, hand them out, never told the press,
*  never made sure nobody knew about it except this bodyguard, and talk to all the people
*  in wheelchairs and give them T-shirts and give them eight tracks for 20 years.
*  Wow.
*  Isn't that cool?
*  That's wild.
*  But this guy tells a million stories, you know, he's been bodyguarding for 20 years.
*  He's got great stories.
*  That's cool.
*  How do we get to him?
*  What were we just talking about?
*  Jerusalem and the Comanches and the torture techniques.
*  So this book on Jerusalem, like what, I've thought about, what is the name of it?
*  Jerusalem, a history or something.
*  I've thought about reading about it and I get anxiety.
*  The book.
*  The just not that particular book, but about Israel and Palestine.
*  But this book goes back to the beginning.
*  This book is really, I mean, I just saw, I've only read like the first couple of, it's amazing.
*  That's the one.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's a crazy place.
*  It's wild.
*  And it starts out, you're like, oh my God, it started on the most bloody, but somehow
*  everybody knew it was significant even then.
*  Like it was never this place that people weren't like, they were always like, no, this is the
*  place.
*  What do you think about that?
*  Do you think, does that make any sense?
*  Is there a place that's more holy than other places?
*  You mean like Sedona?
*  Yeah.
*  Like Sedona's a good one.
*  That's a good one for hippies.
*  Yeah.
*  For hippies believe Sedona is like a sacred place.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I always feel like they're saying, well, even when I was just at the gig, I was at
*  the gig with Kevin Fitzgerald, who was in the where the Shining is in Colorado, where
*  they shot the Shining, that hotel.
*  Yeah.
*  And so they go, it's haunted.
*  And I'm talking to the kid that works there and he goes, listen, he goes, I didn't believe
*  any of this shit.
*  He goes, I've worked here for two years.
*  It's real.
*  He goes, Lucy, they knew the names of the ghost.
*  Lucy, she's a redhead.
*  He goes, I opened the mirror when I'm here alone at one in the morning, because it's
*  kind of a really out of the way place.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  And you start describing all these things that happened.
*  You're like, oh, God.
*  So I do believe this place is sure.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's there's something to some of it.
*  There has to be.
*  Yeah.
*  What is it?
*  What does it mean?
*  Why are they willing to kill each other over one place?
*  Because they think God's coming to this one place.
*  Like, what do they know?
*  Yeah.
*  It's so it's so important to them.
*  Like how about you're going to love this book.
*  I'm sure.
*  This is exactly the point.
*  How about Mecca?
*  How many Muslims travel to Mecca?
*  Yeah.
*  You're you're absolved of your sins.
*  Yeah.
*  You go to Mecca, you make the pilgrimage and they all go around and they're they're essentially
*  walking around a meteor.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a meteorite, right?
*  Is it?
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's the center.
*  Isn't that what it is?
*  The center of that box in Mecca?
*  I think that's what it is.
*  Look at that.
*  I mean, when you also like how beautiful is that?
*  I know there you probably really believe even I mean, it probably even if it wasn't true,
*  would have that effect on you.
*  Just psychologically.
*  Yeah.
*  Going to this incredible location.
*  With all these people.
*  With all these people and everybody's peaceful.
*  And nobody's talking about Medina.
*  Nobody's talking about anything.
*  Mecca and Medina and they always talk about Mecca.
*  It's like Springsteen and John Kugelman.
*  Where's Medina?
*  That's the other one.
*  The other one.
*  So does it say there's a stone there?
*  But isn't there Google meteor or meteorite?
*  It's where the yeah, it's where Mohammed first saw the thing, right?
*  I think there's there's something to the.
*  Okay, there it is.
*  Oh, there it is.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  The embedded black stone was a further symbol of this as a meteorite that had fallen from
*  the sky and linked heaven and earth.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy that they got one spot like they'll fight over that spot.
*  You can't have that spot.
*  They do.
*  That's oh, yeah.
*  Imagine if like the United States wanted to put a military base on that spot like now
*  we got to take away your religious spot.
*  It's not real.
*  Now that would take away your spot.
*  That would be a real deal breaker.
*  That could be a deal breaker.
*  Where's Medina?
*  Oh, there's Medina right next to it.
*  They just spelled it different.
*  I keep thinking about Tyler Perry's character.
*  Medina.
*  That's Mecca.
*  That's Medina.
*  And Medina was cool, too.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  They always say Mecca and Medina.
*  Oh, really?
*  I only heard Mecca.
*  People pray to Mecca.
*  They don't pray to Medina.
*  How come?
*  I think you have to go to both.
*  So is it like it's a major Islamic.
*  They're really downgrading Medina.
*  I don't like this.
*  Yeah.
*  The tombs are there.
*  The tomb of the Prophet Muhammad and other leaders are at Medina.
*  Is it like Simon and Garfunkel?
*  Not that big.
*  Like one of them, they just, who?
*  Where's Garfunkel?
*  He was like, hey, Garfunkel's great.
*  What happened?
*  He was great.
*  Oh.
*  What happened?
*  Yeah.
*  Indeed, it's Garfunkel.
*  Those things happen.
*  Although I'm sure they wouldn't, of all the people to be compared to, I don't think Simon
*  and Garfunkel are what they wouldn't be compared to, if you know what I mean.
*  I know what you mean.
*  I do know what you mean.
*  They say, can you name somebody else, please?
*  But I wonder what is so specific about that area.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  No, I think Muhammad's from there or something.
*  Yeah.
*  And also the areas in Israel.
*  These areas that are, you know.
*  Oh yeah.
*  The wall.
*  Well, this Jerusalem book is really getting into it.
*  And I'm like, oh my God.
*  Just the early stuff that's happening.
*  There it is.
*  Okay.
*  It's known as a site where the Prophet Muhammad received the command to change the direction
*  of prayer to Mecca.
*  Oh, so that's where he learned it.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a weird time for religion for sure.
*  It's also a weird time for the Jews.
*  Like, I've never seen more anti-Semitism, like openly.
*  Yeah.
*  Public and openly.
*  Yeah.
*  Than now.
*  Yeah.
*  Like just regular anti-Semitism.
*  Not even towards these particular Israelis that are bombing Gaza.
*  Right.
*  Just across the board.
*  Yes.
*  Some 24 year old kid in New York is responsible for what's happening in Palestine.
*  Right.
*  Just because he has a Star of David on.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's good.
*  The internet has also got a group.
*  It's got a group hysteria, like a mob hysteria to it.
*  100%.
*  And then people are just like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And get out all your things on that.
*  100%.
*  That's exactly what it is.
*  And it's also a bunch of people that have been bullied and they've been marginalized
*  and now they're a part of a team and then they bully other people.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's not all hurt people, hurt people things.
*  It's absolutely.
*  There's suddenly, you know what it feels like to be in a gang, only you don't have to worry
*  about physical repercussions.
*  Exactly.
*  And that's a good feeling.
*  Yeah.
*  Power.
*  Destroy people.
*  You got power.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Wild, wild.
*  It's changed our psychology completely.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Ours a little bit, but the people that grew up on it have a whole different psychology.
*  They have a whole different mind than we do.
*  Yeah, they do.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's also a lot of really mentally ill people that are addicted to it.
*  Well, yeah, that's why.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Of course.
*  That's a big part of it, right?
*  And you watch them get more and more obsessed each day.
*  You watch them become more and more compulsive and more and more.
*  You see it happen over the years.
*  I've seen it with people I know.
*  Yeah, they fall apart.
*  Yeah.
*  I know quite a few people that are really falling apart because of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Have you ever thought about going to the flip phone?
*  A flip phone?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't even know if I had a flip phone back when they came out.
*  Completely disconnect.
*  Like Dave Vittel.
*  He's all flip phone.
*  He is.
*  Flip phone.
*  Yeah.
*  When he texts, he had a text when he was making a text in here.
*  It's like, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
*  It takes forever.
*  It takes forever to write a letter.
*  I like when that guy, Christopher Nolan, did you see his wife gave that speech when he
*  won the Academy Award this year?
*  Yeah.
*  And she gave the speech.
*  She goes, she was the producer, I guess, of the movie.
*  And she goes, and my husband who doesn't have a phone, never had a phone, never had a computer,
*  this guy does all these high tech things.
*  He doesn't only have a computer or a phone.
*  Wow.
*  Isn't that weird?
*  It is weird.
*  Tucker Carlson doesn't have a computer either.
*  Wow.
*  Doesn't have a television.
*  I remember hearing in the 90s, Quentin Tarantino wrote his scripts by hand.
*  Like he never used even a typewriter or computer.
*  You'd think a guy like him would be into it.
*  Well, a lot of people like writing things by hand.
*  In fact, I'm pretty sure J.K. Rowling wrote Harry Potter by hand.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Pretty sure she wrote it by hand.
*  See if that's true.
*  I think she wrote it by hand first and then typed it out later.
*  I mean, that's, that's a, that's so amazing.
*  I also think that's how Bill Clinton wrote his autobiography.
*  My Life.
*  Yeah, he wrote it.
*  99% sure he wrote it.
*  It's crazy to me.
*  Yeah.
*  I wrote first two Potters by hand.
*  Wow.
*  And typed them on a 10 year old typewriter.
*  All a writer needs is talent and ink.
*  That's insane.
*  That is amazing.
*  That's amazing.
*  Hand drawn plot map for inception.
*  Wow.
*  That's nuts.
*  Get his thoughts out, you know.
*  That is nuts.
*  Wow.
*  What a psycho.
*  No computer.
*  That's crazy.
*  Does like the most advanced screen, his movies are always like.
*  Maybe that's why.
*  Maybe he realizes like he has more bandwidth.
*  Yeah.
*  Concentrating on something that's really important to him and less room for nonsense.
*  But those things you think they would give you more time for that kind of thought.
*  Yeah, I think, but I think they also distract you.
*  There's so much distraction online.
*  It's so difficult to do work.
*  And I guess if you just choose to not engage in it at all, then you're only concentrating
*  on work because you're not checking your favorite site.
*  No, you're not seeing what's on YouTube.
*  You know, and him and JK Rowling both go in the magic realm.
*  They go into another realm.
*  So maybe that's how they get there.
*  Especially JK.
*  Yeah.
*  She created a whole world.
*  She really did.
*  A whole world of wizards and lost kids and magic spells.
*  Great shit.
*  Amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  And now she's in trouble.
*  Oh, God.
*  She thinks men are men and women are women.
*  I mean, it's just insane that you can actually have that kind of insane opinion.
*  How dare she?
*  It's psychotic because she's in real trouble.
*  Everybody's like, oh, she's not canceled.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, she's making her money because of her books, but don't act like she's not canceled.
*  Well, people are there.
*  She gets death threats.
*  I mean, it's like, she's sick.
*  It's weird.
*  It's a weird.
*  It's weird.
*  The weirdest.
*  That's a big part of it.
*  People like that can all get together.
*  People that think that's okay can get together and act as a gang.
*  And everyone's so terrified of them, they just kind of let them do it.
*  And nobody stands up and says, what the fuck are you doing?
*  Everybody's just kind of quiet.
*  Even people that are on the left, they will support the people that are canceling her
*  so that they don't get canceled.
*  You see it happen all the time.
*  Instead of saying, hey, she's a wonderful person and she has a right to her opinion.
*  It's a very reasonable opinion.
*  Oh, what are you saying?
*  Crazy.
*  What are you saying?
*  It's terrible.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's why they're so adamant about getting you to comply.
*  There can't be any debate on it because they know it's ridiculous.
*  So they have to like fight you with tooth and nail.
*  Trans women are women.
*  Yeah.
*  You're like, okay, all of them.
*  Are you sure?
*  Are you sure all of them?
*  Maybe you got a few psychos in there that are pretending.
*  Yeah.
*  No, no.
*  Okay.
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  And those are the ones that go after JK Rowling, the psychos.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, at least she stands up.
*  That lady's got courage.
*  She's got a lot of courage.
*  Yeah.
*  She won't stop talking about it.
*  I think she probably probably took her forever to realize like this isn't going away.
*  So this is just what it is.
*  Fuck you.
*  Fuck you.
*  The truth is the truth.
*  Fuck off.
*  Fuck off.
*  I had Riley Gaines on the podcast.
*  Oh, yeah, the swimmer.
*  Yeah.
*  That's that's a crazy case.
*  Yeah.
*  He just let a guy start swimming with girls.
*  He says he's a girl.
*  And when he wins, you go, well, I guess she's the best.
*  You're like, excuse me, I gotta clean my goggles for a second.
*  I think I saw something.
*  You imagine when we were kids, this being a legitimate issue that's like national.
*  But it's just everybody on the sidelines is watching the pool going.
*  Yeah.
*  They should all be able to vote.
*  Like everyone should vote.
*  Like get every one of these things.
*  Like how many of you think that a biological male should be?
*  And if you say yes, and if it wins, it's fine.
*  Then the biological males can comply.
*  That's absolutely right.
*  But if everybody says no, no, you can't do it.
*  But that's the thing.
*  Instead of just saying, look, we all understand trans people deserve rights.
*  They get abused.
*  We all agree.
*  Right.
*  But you can't be in the swim.
*  You can't be in the swim with girls.
*  You can't fight girls.
*  You can't.
*  You just can't.
*  All the other stuff we understand.
*  You can't play rugby against girls.
*  No.
*  No, you can't even play basketball against girls.
*  You're too big.
*  But saying that is really considered hate speech.
*  I know.
*  That's what's nuts.
*  Despite, but that's where it's anti-science.
*  Because if you just want to look at it objectively, if you didn't think of it as a man and a woman,
*  if you just took it like an equation, if you just looked at the numbers that are on one
*  side of this equation, if you're trying to pretend that these two numbers are equivalent
*  and you look at one of them and it has much greater lung capacity, much stronger heart,
*  denser bones, different hip structure, less susceptibility to ACL tears, different reaction
*  times, if you just looked at just the system, just a system of what it means to be a male
*  human being and compared it to like the elite of elite female human beings, you'd go, oh,
*  this is not an equal.
*  It's not equal.
*  It's just not equal.
*  Yeah.
*  His sad part also is I guarantee most trans people feel the same way and they can't say
*  it.
*  Right, because they're not trying to compete.
*  Because they'll be considered sellouts if they say it in their community.
*  They'll be considered sellouts and they're not allowed to say their opinion.
*  That's what I think.
*  Well, there's a rift now between a lot of gay people and trans people.
*  That too, yeah.
*  But I say even trans.
*  Because a lot of gay people are like, look, I'm not a girl.
*  I just like guys.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you don't say I'm, and you're encouraging young boys to change their gender.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're not going to be able to come anymore.
*  Like if you're encouraging them to get the operation, which is crazy because they're
*  doing thousands of them, you'll never have an orgasm again.
*  They remove your penis.
*  It's gone.
*  They create a vagina.
*  You have to keep it dilated with a thingy stuff up there.
*  Are you sure?
*  Are you sure?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  We tell you, you know, 35.
*  At least.
*  We make those decisions.
*  If you're a 35 year old guy and you want to become a girl.
*  God bless you.
*  God bless you.
*  But that's the thing.
*  I think a lot of trans people agree with all of this.
*  I think they do too.
*  And they just, they know that they're not allowed because they don't want to throw the
*  baby out with the bath water.
*  And it's like, there's a lot of things going on where they're like, why would I sacrifice
*  against my community when I'm just going to get screwed by both sides on it?
*  That's the other thing that goes on with the internet hysteria is that suddenly if you
*  deviate at all, you're out in bad standing with everybody.
*  Well, that's the problem with D transitioners.
*  The people that transition and have deep regret, they get attacked.
*  They get attacked.
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  And then gay people who say that they wanted to be trans when they were younger, but then
*  they realized they were just gay when they were older.
*  And thank God I didn't do anything.
*  Those people get attacked.
*  Yeah.
*  But that is, that's a large number.
*  There was a study about that, about how a lot of the people that thought that they were
*  trans when they were younger, if in time they're just gay.
*  When there's a thing that you're told like, oh no, you're this.
*  Then they give you hormones, which adjusts everything, literally changes the way you
*  feel.
*  Sure.
*  And for girls to boys, it alleviates anxiety, which is a problem because then you think
*  this is what I've always been.
*  Because you're taking testosterone.
*  Of course you're going to feel different.
*  And now you're saying, oh, this is how I always was.
*  If it is how you always were, you wouldn't have to take this exogenous hormone.
*  That wouldn't be necessary.
*  If you think you're a boy, just be a boy.
*  You might just be a gay girl.
*  And if you think you're a boy and you're a girl, just live your life the way you want
*  to live your life.
*  Absolutely.
*  But if you start injecting things into your body when you're 14 or 15 years old, you'll
*  never be the same again.
*  It's just, you don't have a chance at normalcy.
*  It's gone.
*  If you change your mind and one day you decide to have children, you might not be able to.
*  You might have ruined your voice.
*  You might have changed and masculinized your features permanently forever.
*  And you might not have really wanted that.
*  You might have just had anxiety.
*  I mean, I started smoking cigarettes when I was 14, even though it's a different thing.
*  But it's the same.
*  They say if you start smoking before you're 18, you have the chance of dying young of
*  lung cancer, a thousand different.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It's a year's thing, right?
*  Yeah.
*  How many years you smoke.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's what year you start to the crazy thing is like when we were kids, people hadn't
*  really got it in their head that smoking was killing people.
*  Yeah.
*  They fought that so long.
*  They did such a great job bullshitting people.
*  They did such a great job of saying, it's probably not that bad for you.
*  Because smoking looks cool.
*  It does look cool.
*  It still looks cool.
*  I see those old French Italian movies.
*  I'm like, oh, man, they're living.
*  They're fucking sitting there smoking.
*  Badass.
*  It's also the idea when you know it's bad for you that this person doesn't care that
*  it's bad for them.
*  They're living for now.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's true, too.
*  That's a person in the moment just living for now.
*  Fuck the future.
*  I remember when I was 11, I had to go down to I wanted to buy a 45 record.
*  I'm from the days there were 45 records.
*  And I asked my aunt, could I have a cigarette?
*  Because you had to walk two avenues and each block, three blocks and two avenues.
*  And every block there was a group of kids, also 11 years old, that were up at that hour.
*  Hey, you.
*  That's what you didn't want to hear.
*  Hey, kid.
*  Like, oh, so I said, if I have a cigarette, I'll just it wasn't lit.
*  And she gave me a cigarette, a Tarry tin.
*  And I walked down the block with my cigarette.
*  Nobody was out anyway.
*  But, you know, that was my move.
*  That and the karate mags.
*  Yeah, that's too good.
*  And the six judo glasses.
*  Young kid with a cigarette.
*  Look at this dangerous little fucker.
*  Yeah.
*  He's probably got a knife.
*  But the karate man, you had to really commit.
*  I literally had to stand on the train like this.
*  A horse stance.
*  Yeah.
*  And stand like this with the magazine open.
*  The train's moving like this.
*  Middle of the subway.
*  Who's going to do that?
*  A karate guy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Smart.
*  He's definitely better than putting in all that work.
*  You don't want to do that.
*  Sadly, that's really my motive is that of a lazy person.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't want to get hit in the head a bunch of times.
*  You know, many guys I know can't breathe out of their nose.
*  And a large percentage of them.
*  But Owen Smith, he went and got the trophy.
*  That's even better.
*  That's a smart move.
*  He's a funny dude, man.
*  Oh, funny.
*  He's so funny.
*  He won his trophy.
*  That's so hilarious.
*  Such a funny thing to do.
*  I knew a story about a dude who is a fake black belt.
*  He actually wound up killing a guy later on in life.
*  Wow, he wasn't that fake.
*  No, it's a crazy story.
*  But the guy was just a compulsive liar, pathological liar.
*  He claimed he was a black belt in some martial art.
*  A lot of people started getting real suspicious of him.
*  What he did was he made his friend drop him off in the woods and he brought a duffel bag
*  with him.
*  He said he was entering into a kumite, like a no rules kumite, this karate fight in the
*  woods and come back and pick me up here tomorrow.
*  So the guy shows up the next day and now he doesn't have the duffel bag, but now he has
*  a trophy that's the same size as the duffel bag.
*  And he said he won the tournament.
*  And so he gets in the guy's car and the guy drives him back.
*  He's like, what?
*  Wow.
*  So he's telling, he just made up a karate tournament in the woods and had his friend
*  drop him off and then had a bag that he brought with him.
*  He was so not clutch, like brought a duffel bag.
*  What's in the duffel bag?
*  Oh, you know, whatever.
*  Yeah, it's a fucking karate tournament.
*  Whatever, my gay.
*  There's a karate tournament.
*  Well, trophy in there.
*  We guess you tell them, I'm the kind of guy that's like, yeah, I like that kid.
*  You call it compulsive liar.
*  I call him a creative thinker.
*  So one little credit for his martial arts.
*  He was apparently allegedly banging this guy's wife and found the guy, got the guy like in
*  his karate studio and strangled the guy to death and then was seen driving around in
*  the guy's car and eventually got arrested for it.
*  Now, wait a minute.
*  He was he had a karate studio?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He was a fake black belt that had a martial arts studio.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Yeah.
*  And he actually had some people that trained with him that were legit martial arts.
*  He didn't know.
*  And he was like kind of just proficient enough in the bullshit and got some guys who actually
*  knew a little bit.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  He was just like, hey, do finger to push ups for 20 minutes.
*  I could teach you how to choke a person pretty quickly.
*  It's not hard to teach someone how to do this with your arm and that with your arm.
*  It's just being able to do it to a person is very difficult.
*  Right.
*  But I could show you very quickly how to squeeze it off and you would be really effective at
*  it.
*  And so that's what he did to this guy.
*  Like, he strangled him to death.
*  He got behind him and he just choked him to death.
*  And then he stole his car and just driving around.
*  I don't know what they did with the body.
*  I don't remember exactly what happened, but I remember like because we had already confronted
*  that guy on being a fake.
*  My friend Eddie actually had a very uncomfortable phone conversation with him while I was with
*  him where he's like, you're full of shit, man.
*  Like you're not a black belt.
*  There's no fucking way you're a black belt.
*  It's like because he was he was telling him he did another thing while we were together.
*  Like he went to Thailand to compete in some mixed martial arts fight.
*  He had just learned this move called the twister, very difficult move to pull off.
*  And he came back and he told Eddie that he he won his fight by the twister.
*  And he was like, what?
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  Like, how did you do that?
*  You don't know how to do that.
*  Like, you don't you're not good.
*  Like he knew he had rolled with the guy.
*  He knew the guy was terrible.
*  And he was saying that, oh, I'm a black belt in Japanese jiu jitsu.
*  It's different. Like, OK.
*  But he was like, no, he was incompetent.
*  He was like a white belt on the ground.
*  And so he knew when he said he won this match, like he didn't really go to Thailand.
*  Like, this is fake. This guy's a nut.
*  And so Eddie had separated from him.
*  And then after that, we hear the story that he killed this guy and was driving the guy's fucking jaguar around town.
*  Like, holy shit. Yeah.
*  Don't you think that compulsive liars like I feel like there's not enough research on what it is,
*  because sometimes you'd be like, that's not true.
*  And they look at you and they you're not embarrassing them.
*  They part of them believes it's true.
*  Well, they just they're broken. Yeah, they're broken.
*  They don't care if you if you feel good or bad.
*  They just want you to buy their story. Yeah.
*  Yeah. They're not really there.
*  They're not really connecting. That's their only mission in life is it's not even sometimes it doesn't even,
*  you know, benefit them. And they still that's the most important thing to them.
*  Have you read about guys who have like pretended to be doctors and set up practices and operated on people?
*  I went to one. The guy I went to one in. Yeah.
*  This is in the 90s. And I'll tell you, it's all over the paper.
*  Dean, I forget his last name, but he's in prison right now for life.
*  Dean, I'll look it up later.
*  But anyway, somebody tells me I had like a cyst on my arm.
*  So they go, I know a guy that'll take it off.
*  And he's a good dermatologist, Dean something.
*  Anyway, so he sets up an appointment and it's on a Saturday at a doctor's Park Avenue.
*  It's but it's Saturday. And I was like, oh, cool. I'm off Saturday.
*  I go over to his office. I walk in.
*  When I think back now, it was like nobody, no receptionist, just him.
*  He goes, I'm just working Saturday by myself.
*  He goes, I let the receptionist off. I was like, oh, cool.
*  I go in the office. It's kind of dark, you know, but it's doctor's office.
*  And I guess he worked for the doctor when he had the keys or something.
*  And he slices the thing off. It kind of hurt.
*  It healed very badly, but it healed. But it was not a great job.
*  I remember thinking, I'll never go back to that guy. He overdid it.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it wasn't the Novakane was weird.
*  Anyway, like four years later, Dean Paiello, FAI.
*  I was waiting to make sure it was the right guy. That's the guy.
*  Sheds light on botched procedure that left New York woman dead nearly 20 years ago.
*  Oh, my God. He buried her.
*  He buried her under a concrete slab in his garage.
*  It's a good thing I left her on my own.
*  Holy shit. What a psycho. Yeah.
*  And it was like, really, like he looked like, you know, he was like,
*  well, quaffed hair and his crazy eyebrows. Is that the guy?
*  Yeah. But I knew him 20 years ago. He looked much better.
*  He buried her. He got out, huh?
*  I don't know exactly how they were talking to him.
*  He got out. No, when he was young, that's that picture doesn't do him justice.
*  Was it creepy looking? What's that? Was it creepy?
*  Yeah, you got to see the young when he's young, the picture of when he's young.
*  He looks like not creepy, but he just looks like he would do it.
*  Yeah, there he is on the left. That's Dean.
*  Yeah, that's when they caught him. Yeah. Wow.
*  Fake doctor Dean Paiello feared something would go wrong.
*  Yeah, I went to him.
*  Do you think did he have any medical history?
*  I mean, he must have worked for an office because he had the keys
*  to the doctor's office.
*  He must have been like this.
*  Just a crazy person.
*  It was receptionist or something. Yeah.
*  And what year was this where he's doing all this stuff?
*  He's from Madison, Jersey.
*  Most likely succeed by his classmates. Wow.
*  Wow. You work construction hair removal.
*  At a day spa became skilled at hair removal.
*  Yeah, 1996, again, his own practice,
*  skin ovations from an office on Park Avenue.
*  Wow. The blood vessel removal, tattoo removal and this.
*  He's selling himself short.
*  He also removed moles.
*  Wow. That must be the office.
*  Park Avenue in 73rd.
*  So how did she die? How did this lady die?
*  He had completed the same procedure on cruise over a dozen times before.
*  Without her experiencing an allergic reaction to lidocaine.
*  Oh, he was not licensed to perform this procedure.
*  It admitted doing at least 14 times on cruise alone.
*  He went on to claim that after some time,
*  Cruz had bubbles coming out of her mouth and her body went limp by his own account.
*  He delayed calling for help, allegedly attempting CPR,
*  but could not get her to start breathing again.
*  He adds that despite being previously certified in electrolysis for hair removal,
*  he didn't have the proper training
*  for what to do when a patient goes into shock.
*  Jesus Christ, what a crazy person.
*  An unverified claim made by Fielo,
*  who is not licensed or trained to make medical diagnoses
*  and claims that he didn't know how to check for a pulse.
*  He admitted walking away while she while he believed she was dying of shock.
*  Fielo later called a doctor he knew personally to explain his version
*  of what happened to Cruz, according to Vanity Fair reporter Brian Burrow.
*  The doctor told him to either call 911 or rush Cruz to a hospital emergency room
*  instead of helping Cruz Fielo shove Cruz's body into a black suitcase,
*  which had been stolen days earlier from his housemate, Mark Richie.
*  Fielo claims he put the suitcase containing Maria Cruz in his car and drove straight home.
*  Then he left her in the trunk for two days before finally removing her body
*  into his garage, which was just undergoing renovations.
*  It's unclear whether Maria Cruz was still alive
*  when Fielo began to try to cover up his actions.
*  Cruz's wallet and purse were discovered by Fielo's housemate
*  inside a black gym bag placed under a rafter in the unfinished
*  ceiling of the garage in August 2003, just one month after Fielo was kicked out.
*  He later admitted in June 2003, nearly three months after Cruz was killed,
*  that he had buried Cruz's body underneath the garage before pouring cement
*  right before a sale of the house was closed.
*  Boy, boy. And see what I said?
*  The numbing agent didn't work.
*  That doctor just kept his fucking mouth shut.
*  Oh, he the doctor he called. Yeah.
*  That doctor never told nobody. Yeah.
*  That's kind of creepy. That's really creepy.
*  Like the doctor never go. Hey, man, whatever happened to that lady?
*  Yeah, he didn't even ask.
*  So like nobody even knew.
*  And all of a sudden she was if that moron didn't leave that gym bag behind,
*  he might have gotten away with it.
*  He probably would have. I'd be going to him today.
*  I mean, in 2003, how good were they at Ketchup People?
*  Yeah, not as good right now.
*  But isn't that funny when I just said that numbing agent didn't work
*  and that's he obviously tried to.
*  Oh, God. OK.
*  In the aftermath of the call between mutual friend
*  of the mutual friend of fail, he did rat him out.
*  They both realized Fielo lied when he stated he got the woman
*  to medical help that she was fine.
*  Bach searched the house now fail wasn't there.
*  And while looking in the garage, we're called Fielo using concrete
*  just before moving out.
*  That's remembered how uncharacteristically secretive
*  he was about the project and his overwrite reaction
*  when Bach walked in on him pouring concrete.
*  According to New York State Detective Lieutenant T.J.
*  Mulrooney, Bach's information gave us the break in the investigation
*  we were hoping for his ex-boyfriend.
*  Oh.
*  Brian Ford received a tip from Fielo's ex-boyfriend, Greg Bach.
*  OK, so that's who Bach is.
*  Maria Cruz's body was recovered from the property, now occupied by new homeowners.
*  Boy, can they get their money back?
*  I want to fucking live in that house.
*  This lady was underneath the garage.
*  You're parking your Honda over a dead lady.
*  Yeah. For months.
*  Well, think of how many people don't know that that's happened in their whole life.
*  Yeah, a lot. Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Dun dun dun.
*  Dun dun dun.
*  That was my guy. Yeah.
*  He was a compulsive liar.
*  Jivreed murder machine. Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. Those guys are something.
*  Yeah. That was Joey Diaz turned me on to that.
*  That book scared the shit out of me about Roy DeMeo.
*  Meanwhile, my friends that grew up around there,
*  they when they were little kids, they were telling me
*  they used to throw snowballs at the old man's bar.
*  That bar. Like, haha, they throw snowballs at the old men drinking there.
*  Meanwhile, they were just slaughtering people.
*  Yeah. They're throwing little 12 year old kids like at the old bastards.
*  They're throwing mafia snowballs.
*  Is the mafia still a thing?
*  I mean, I don't think it's I mean, it's still a thing, but I don't think it's
*  nothing. I mean, when you think about how important the mafia was
*  in the 50s and 60s and 70s,
*  it's in even the 80s, but it's insane how much power they had.
*  Vegas. I mean, they probably killed Kennedy.
*  I mean, well, it had something to do with it.
*  But they even if they didn't, they had so much power
*  over so many industries.
*  It was insane.
*  Well, we got to you got to remember Kennedy fucked them over.
*  Yeah, because they got him in.
*  They helped him get him in.
*  They helped him win. But they say that.
*  But how much is it? So they got him Chicago.
*  You know what I mean? A lot.
*  Yeah, I guess so. But I mean, yeah.
*  And then he turned on him.
*  Well, he led Robert turn on him. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Robert turn on. Not good.
*  But here's the weird thing.
*  Didn't Robert turn on them in the 50s?
*  Was that the I feel like it was before Kennedy was president,
*  but made a promise to lay off and then he didn't. Really?
*  But I guess that's why I would love to.
*  That's the one thing I'd like to see before I die.
*  I'm sure everybody would.
*  I want those Kennedy pay. I want those papers.
*  Did you hear what Trump had said about them?
*  What? You don't want to see them or something?
*  Yeah. He said if they showed you what they showed me,
*  you wouldn't release it either.
*  But what does that mean?
*  He said he's going to release him.
*  If they that means they that means they threatened him.
*  Probably means it's right. What else could it mean?
*  Well, I guess you wouldn't want to release it either.
*  It's like, what? What's going to happen?
*  It's 60 years later. It could be.
*  It could destroy the CIA. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's what I mean. That's why.
*  Yeah, that's why you shouldn't release it.
*  That if you were the president and they told you that,
*  what would you do?
*  You know, well, you know what?
*  The public deserves to know let's destroy the CIA.
*  Or do you say, you know what?
*  We're going to hide this and you're going to give the CIA even more power.
*  But I'm saying here's the thing.
*  If you killed the president, whatever this was, 2019, right?
*  Yeah. What you would do is you would say this CIA
*  was nothing like today's CIA.
*  That was back in 1963. You know what I mean?
*  That's what you would say.
*  You would say that was the terrible time in our history.
*  And thank God there's been several changes.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I just don't know if people would accept that.
*  Except that the CIA hasn't has changed.
*  Yeah, I don't think they would.
*  I think it would open up scrutiny.
*  That would be almost impossible for them to do their job
*  the way they do it right now.
*  They just changed the name of the organization.
*  They changed immigration.
*  INS became ICE, became ASI, became, you know what I mean?
*  Like change the name of the CIA. How dare you?
*  Yeah. What are you a communist?
*  Changes to the Central Intelligence Agency.
*  I know. I never liked that name anyway.
*  It's stupid.
*  You know what I mean?
*  This got to be a better name.
*  What do you propose?
*  The United States
*  over the over.
*  Well, let's think of something.
*  It has to be something like, you know, like the overlords.
*  How about that?
*  That's what they are.
*  Information overlords.
*  Let's just cut to the chase.
*  The information overlords.
*  We decide what gets out.
*  We find out what's happening.
*  How about the American Shadow Boys?
*  Oh, I like it.
*  Shadow Boys sounds like a cool band.
*  Yeah, that was a cool bluegrass band.
*  Shadow Boys, Sixth Street, like some do with a banjo.
*  They play at Sixth Street.
*  Yeah, that sounds like a good band.
*  The Shadow Boys. I like that.
*  All right. I'm good at band names.
*  Are you? Give me another one.
*  I tried to make my nephew back 20 years ago.
*  He's trying to be a band.
*  I said, call yourselves. Do you know what?
*  I'm going to call myself the Shadow Boys.
*  Because that was my favorite joke.
*  You hear that parrot joke?
*  Oh, you hear that parrot joke about the guy buys the parrot.
*  He goes, you don't want to buy this parrot.
*  He's got a filthy mouth and he goes, I can handle it.
*  That comes home.
*  The parrot goes, hey, Mr.
*  Misty, he goes, what?
*  He goes, go fuck yourself.
*  The guy goes, don't talk to me.
*  That smacks the cage.
*  Parrot beats up the parrot goes, don't ever.
*  He goes, I'm not the guy to play with like that.
*  Next day comes home.
*  Packers. Hey, Mr.
*  Misty goes, what?
*  He goes, fuck yourself.
*  He goes, you piece.
*  So smash, you almost drowned the parrot.
*  He goes, next time you somebody go fuck myself.
*  I'm going to kill you.
*  I promise you, I'm going to kill you.
*  Next day he shows up after work.
*  Parrot goes, hey, Mr.
*  Misty goes, what?
*  Parrot goes, you know what?
*  I forgot that joke.
*  That's a good one.
*  That's a good one.
*  That's what they used to do in the old days.
*  Catskill guys, they just go up there and tell jokes.
*  There's still guys that do that shit.
*  Yeah, I hate to say it.
*  And I always get jealous because I'm always like,
*  God damn it, they work every time.
*  They're great jokes.
*  All those old jokes, people are like,
*  oh, that's an old joke.
*  It's like, yeah, and they're great jokes.
*  But we would never do it.
*  We would never lower ourselves.
*  The weird thing about great jokes is who wrote them?
*  Where do they come from?
*  I tried to get, I used to live in the same building
*  with Jackie Montling, the joke man.
*  Jackie the joke man.
*  So one time I go, Jackie, his old,
*  it was like 15 years ago, I go,
*  we're going to do a documentary.
*  We're going to find out all the jokes,
*  where they come from, who wrote them.
*  I said, because you must know a lot of this
*  because he knows every joke ever written.
*  So I go, you must know some of this.
*  He goes, no, I don't.
*  I go, what?
*  He goes, I don't know any of those.
*  I go, you know all these jokes.
*  Your whole life is built on it.
*  You didn't bother to try to find out.
*  He goes, I have no idea where they came from.
*  So even he doesn't know.
*  I don't think anybody knows.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Isn't that weird that nobody,
*  some of these jokes are amazing and nobody knows.
*  Nobody knows where any of them came from.
*  It's weird.
*  It's weird and some of them are great.
*  Where do they come from?
*  And that's also, we have that with memes now.
*  And some memes, you know who did it
*  because they put like a watermark on it
*  and they posted on their site.
*  Some memes, you get it in a text message chain.
*  Someone just sends you something.
*  You're like, ah!
*  And then you send it to your friends and they're like, ah!
*  And nobody knows where it came from.
*  And some of them are some of the funniest fucking things
*  that I've ever seen online.
*  Really funny.
*  Really funny.
*  Where does it all come from?
*  Well, you're getting, now especially, especially with memes,
*  you're getting the input of millions of people.
*  And there's so many people out there
*  that could have been comics and just chose not to be.
*  Either they didn't try it and they have a mind for it,
*  but they're funny.
*  And so they get their funny out on the sneak tip.
*  They get their funny out when no one's looking.
*  They take a picture of Taylor Swift
*  and they do something to it
*  and they write something underneath it
*  and they post it up there and they're like, ah!
*  And that's how they're doing comedy.
*  They're getting that out in this way.
*  And when you're sourcing from millions and millions
*  and millions of people like we're doing currently,
*  probably more, probably billions of English-speaking people
*  that are contributing to the meme pool of the world.
*  Because you have all these other countries
*  with millions of people.
*  It's probably a billion plus people that are doing that.
*  And they're all online.
*  And out of those, you're gonna get a few thousand
*  hilarious people that have never done standup
*  and could be a David Tell.
*  They just never did it.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah, I mean, those minds exist.
*  Oh, I used to have a few friends that were really funny.
*  We had this friend Al, a friend Al,
*  would work in an ambulance.
*  He would come home every night.
*  And remember, he would have an experience every night
*  because he's in an ambulance.
*  He would come back and tell us stories
*  and people would be, the next day, and we'd be crying.
*  Because every night, the way he told, he was a funny guy.
*  And he would just talk about all the abuse he took
*  as the striver.
*  So I pull up and he was that kind of guy, like you said.
*  He could have been a great comic.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of guys like that.
*  The funniest guy I ever knew who was in a comic
*  was a guy I worked for.
*  He was a private investigator.
*  His name was Dave Dolan.
*  He used to call himself Dynamite Dickless Dave Dolan.
*  He'd leave messages on my voicemail.
*  I still have a phone number that I haven't gotten rid of.
*  I have this phone because it has a voicemail on it
*  from him before he died.
*  And he was a private investigator.
*  He lost his license, drunk driving.
*  And so he needed someone to be his driver.
*  So he put an ad in the newspaper for private investigators
*  apprentice.
*  I was like, oh, I'll try that.
*  I needed some other kind of a job to just sustain myself.
*  I was trying to make a living doing stand up.
*  And so I drove this guy around for six months
*  until he got his license back.
*  And we did a lot of private investigative work.
*  And he would just make you laugh.
*  Oh my God, he was hilarious.
*  He was so funny.
*  He was so funny about everything.
*  He was always funny.
*  He was just on.
*  He was everybody he talked to.
*  They just start smiling the moment they
*  start talking to this guy.
*  He was a charming dude.
*  He was smart as shit.
*  He was just very, very funny.
*  And I would be crying.
*  And I remember telling my girlfriend at the time,
*  I came back.
*  We went out to dinner that night.
*  And we were eating.
*  And I was like, I'm not anywhere near as funny as this guy.
*  And he doesn't even want to be a comedian.
*  Because I was an open micer at the time.
*  I was just starting.
*  They're just funny.
*  He was just funny.
*  I mean, just the fucking guy had a funny take on everything.
*  And he was a drunk.
*  But he's quit drinking like that.
*  Never went back to it.
*  Never fell off the wagon.
*  Was getting hammered every night.
*  And then went to nothing.
*  And still had the sensibility of a hilarious guy at the bar.
*  He still act like a drunk.
*  He was stone cold sober.
*  He had no filter.
*  Dick Dolan.
*  Yeah.
*  Dynamite Dave Dolan.
*  Al Canter, same thing.
*  Yeah, there's those guys out there.
*  Just would come out and just roll.
*  22 minutes a day.
*  It always makes me think about that Billy Joel song.
*  I'm sure that I could be a movie star if I could get out
*  of this place.
*  Sing us a song on the piano, man.
*  I mean, there's a lot of people out there that just never
*  tried it.
*  Never went for it.
*  Never tried to do something.
*  And there's a million things you get in a way.
*  Have you ever heard of Forrester's Syndrome?
*  No.
*  I was looking up the origin of knock-knock jokes.
*  And this popped up in this article that said, in Europe,
*  incessant wordplay became treated
*  as a psychological condition.
*  Oh my god.
*  Jamie's got to go to a hospital.
*  Manic punning, people that were compulsively punning.
*  Well, that's Tony Hinchcliffe.
*  Right.
*  Tony Hinchcliffe would 100% get locked up.
*  Compulsive punning and inappropriate jokes
*  was known as Forrester's Syndrome in the 1920s or 30s.
*  I guess that's back when people needed to go to work.
*  There was only work.
*  Joking.
*  Hold on.
*  Sorry.
*  Joking just got in the way of things.
*  Well, especially in 1929, Austrian psychoanalyst A.A.
*  Brill was exploring a malady termed Witzelschacht.
*  How do you say that?
*  Yeah, that sounds good.
*  Witzelschacht.
*  Witzelschacht.
*  An addiction to wisecracks, according to Psychology Today,
*  German neurologist Autrid Forster identified manic punning
*  in what eventually became known as Forrester's Syndrome.
*  Wow.
*  And then I guess people got tired of it.
*  And they lumped knock-knock jokes in there.
*  Because there was like, on the radio in the 30s,
*  people would knock-knock jokes for everywhere, at clubs.
*  By the way, would this not be a great movie?
*  Yeah, it would be a great movie.
*  OK, so we all agree, basically, that the first real stand-up
*  in terms of the way we do it was Lenny.
*  Lenny Bruce.
*  He was the first.
*  So he was the first guy to just talk about stuff.
*  Game change.
*  Yeah.
*  Just talk about stuff and make it funny,
*  instead of just have a series of jokes that anybody could tell.
*  Well, not anybody, but right.
*  But you know, like, Catskill guys, they could all...
*  So many of them were just joke tellers.
*  Yeah.
*  No, he was a game changer.
*  Yeah.
*  Who have you seen live?
*  Who did you get a chance to see live?
*  Did you see Pryor live?
*  No.
*  Never.
*  I had Carlin on Tough Crowd.
*  Oh, really?
*  That was fun.
*  Oh, wow.
*  That must have been awesome.
*  That was really awesome.
*  My whole, all my family, my family never really
*  come to show.
*  I'm from New York, so my cousins, everybody,
*  they've been in my shows over the years,
*  but this is already 100 years.
*  They're not going to come.
*  I forget how I knew, but I told them, the whole stands,
*  there was 40 or 50 of my family, my cousins, my uncles, my aunts.
*  Because Carlin, for Irish people of a certain, that routine he did
*  was like, it's the first time I saw a comedy have that power or two.
*  They would just listen to it and just laugh over the Catholic school
*  experience that traumatized them.
*  And this guy did 13 minutes explaining it.
*  That's all it was, 13 minutes, and it changed their whole lives.
*  And so they all showed up.
*  And it was just a really power.
*  And he was set high.
*  He understood.
*  He went out there and was like, hey, how you doing to them?
*  It was really interesting.
*  Look at little skinny Jim.
*  Yep.
*  Little young, baby-faced Colin Quinn.
*  Jim demanded to be on that show, by the way.
*  He loves Colin.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Look at Nick DePaulo.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Young and handsome.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Greg Giraldo.
*  Wow.
*  That was a great show.
*  Do you think you'd ever redo that show?
*  Would you ever want to?
*  No, we talked about this last time.
*  I feel like it was what it was at the time.
*  And it's just, but you were so good as a host.
*  Thanks.
*  Thanks.
*  Have you thought about doing something like that?
*  Will you host something with comics?
*  Well, when I did this cop show on YouTube,
*  it was basically like a law and order show.
*  And I started having comedians on it.
*  And I was planning on making it like I would have Jim on.
*  But the plot would involve insulting him
*  and attacking him.
*  And then Bobby Kelly came on.
*  And he's dressed as a sister, like a villain.
*  And he's complaining about me putting him
*  in this women's outfit and Keith Robinson.
*  So it became sort of like, that's what I would do.
*  But I mean, I ran out of money.
*  But I mean, I did a bunch of those cop show type things.
*  I think tough crowd in a lot of ways
*  was the beginning of podcasting.
*  Yeah.
*  I think a combination of the Opie and Anthony show
*  and tough crowd.
*  Yeah.
*  Because those are the first places
*  where comics got together and just talked shit.
*  And be themselves.
*  And talked shit to each other.
*  And were riffing.
*  And laughing at each other.
*  And having a good time together.
*  Yeah.
*  And you saw the comradery, which you didn't really
*  see that with comedians.
*  You saw them on stage by themselves telling their routine.
*  You never saw them sitting down together like that.
*  No.
*  No.
*  Yeah, it was definitely an interesting thing.
*  But I thought I would do it in that form.
*  The cop show thing.
*  Because that was more, you could still do it.
*  And you could make fun of the culture at the same time.
*  It was another way of doing it.
*  But anyway, I did that for a while.
*  But that show was groundbreaking.
*  Because you guys would cover cultural issues, current news
*  events, things that were happening.
*  And you get all these comics have a take on things.
*  And then trash somebody's personal life
*  too in the middle of it.
*  And there's clips on Instagram.
*  Like there's one channel that has all Tough Crowd clips.
*  And you go and watch it.
*  Oh my god, these guys are going to be in so much trouble today.
*  Oh, we'd be gone.
*  Even back then we got in trouble.
*  I know, but it's just crazy.
*  I mean, we're talking like Tough Crowd ended 2000 what?
*  2004.
*  2004.
*  20 years.
*  Wow.
*  20 years ago.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  That's 20 years ago.
*  Oh, god.
*  Boy.
*  It makes no sense.
*  Time is just a motherfucker, isn't it?
*  It's ridiculous.
*  It's so quick.
*  It's terrible.
*  It's so long and yet so quick.
*  So much experience and yet it just all happened just
*  a little while ago.
*  But so long ago.
*  20 years is a long, long time.
*  It's insane to me.
*  Yeah.
*  It feels like it was yesterday.
*  It feels like it never happened.
*  It feels like both.
*  It feels like it was just recent and like it was never
*  it never occurred.
*  It's a movie I watched.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Like if you watch it, you won't even remember what you said.
*  And you think about Geraldo and Patrice.
*  These guys had long gone.
*  One of your crazy Geraldo story.
*  Sure.
*  Really weird.
*  I went to a movie recently and I'm leaving the movie theater
*  and I went into the bathroom.
*  And as I'm leaving the bathroom, this guy walks in
*  and he recognizes me.
*  And he said, hey, what's up?
*  And I go, what's up?
*  And I thought it was Greg Geraldo for like one second
*  because he was like he was taller,
*  but he looked exactly like a young Geraldo.
*  And my brain, I didn't expect to see him.
*  And so I opened the door and this guy's there
*  and he says, what's up to me?
*  And I think he recognized me because it's like,
*  no, Greg's dead.
*  It's crazy.
*  And this isn't Greg.
*  This is crazy.
*  And I'm like, hey, what's up, man?
*  How you doing?
*  Nice to meet you.
*  And so I recover and I walk out and then I'm like, oh my god.
*  And I tell my wife, I said, I just thought
*  I saw a dead friend of mine.
*  For one second, I thought it was him.
*  I know it sounds crazy, but I was so happy to see him
*  for that one second before I realized.
*  It's like a dream, yeah.
*  It was horrible, but it was great.
*  For that one second, it was great because I was like, Greg.
*  But it wasn't him.
*  And they're gone forever.
*  He was on the same set as me when I was doing news radio.
*  So we were doing news radio at one of the buildings.
*  And his building was right next door
*  when he was doing his sitcom.
*  So we would always hang out together in the parking lot
*  and talk shit and watch Joey Lawrence get into his car.
*  I mean, that's just great, right?
*  When you see, of course.
*  Yeah, he had a sitcom there too.
*  Yeah, they had a big scandal recently,
*  some chameleon thing, right?
*  Didn't they?
*  What?
*  Who did?
*  The Lawrence Brothers.
*  Really?
*  I thought I saw something.
*  For real?
*  I didn't hear about that.
*  What is it?
*  I don't know, because there's also a lawsuit about one
*  of the things.
*  Sorry, there's a lawsuit about one of those.
*  Google that.
*  I haven't heard that story at all.
*  But he would play his own music in his car.
*  Joey.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  Play his own music, rock it out.
*  Must have been fun.
*  He'd be a beautiful, handsome 19-year-old with a sitcom.
*  He's probably like 19, 20 years old, that older than that.
*  Just playing his own music in his car.
*  I was like, look at this guy.
*  I love it when you run into another comedian
*  when you're involved with non-comedy things.
*  Yes.
*  Matthew Lawrence.
*  That's what it was.
*  My agency fired me after I refused to take my clothes off
*  for an award-winning director.
*  Whoa.
*  Whoa.
*  So they were involved in the victim side of it.
*  Yes.
*  He was supposed to be like a superhero movie,
*  or one of these things.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  It's creepy when you find out how much of that stuff is real.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  The more they unveil, the more stories come out.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Kids, Nickelodeon, like the Nickelodeon guy.
*  Nice, the Nickelodeon thing.
*  I was watching that.
*  Doesn't it make sense, though?
*  If you were a fucking creep, you'd want to work with kids.
*  There's been many times in my life
*  where I've been propositioned to get a huge role, Lawrence
*  says in the podcast.
*  I lost my agency because I went to the hotel room where
*  the actor alleges a prominent director showed up in his robe,
*  asked me to take my clothes off, said
*  he needed to take Polaroids of me,
*  and said if I did X, Y, and Z, I would be the next Marvel
*  character.
*  Holy fuck.
*  Yo.
*  If he's telling the truth, yo.
*  Yeah.
*  You know who else was on the set?
*  Lenny Clark.
*  Oh, he was?
*  Yeah, Lenny Clark was on that show with,
*  what the fuck was his name?
*  He played a judge.
*  He used to be on the Harry, Harry Anderson.
*  God damn it, he had a show.
*  It was a show with his name.
*  John LaRocquette.
*  Yes, the John LaRocquette show.
*  Pull up the cast of the John LaRocquette show.
*  Did you ever hear that story about Lenny Clark,
*  that when he first got a sitcom in the 80s?
*  I saw him out there in 91, whatever it was.
*  There it is.
*  Look at Lenny.
*  So I knew Lenny because the second time I ever
*  got paid to do stand up, I opened for Lenny.
*  And Lenny's like, kid, you're hilarious.
*  He gave me all his great advice.
*  I was like, holy shit, Lenny Clark from HBO?
*  He said I'm funny?
*  He laughed at me?
*  This was amazing.
*  And so years later, it was like five, six years later,
*  Lenny and I are working on sitcoms on the same lot,
*  just right next to each other.
*  But the story is when he got his own sitcom, Lenny,
*  back in like 91.
*  And he went to the bank.
*  And he says, I went to the bank.
*  I think you told me the story.
*  Maybe I heard it on a show.
*  But he goes, and they go, well, Mr. Clark,
*  you can't buy this house.
*  We need this collateral.
*  He goes, here's my collateral.
*  He showed him a TV guide.
*  He was on the cover.
*  The cover of TV guide back when that was a good thing.
*  He got robbed.
*  He did?
*  Yeah, his agent.
*  He was a part of, I think it was the Star agency.
*  An agent robbing?
*  I know, crazy.
*  But I think this one person got like Jerry Seinfeld,
*  got him, got a bunch of people.
*  Wait, I knew those guys, of course.
*  You know that story?
*  Spotlight.
*  Yes, that's it.
*  Yeah, not Star, Spotlight.
*  Spotlight, yeah.
*  They fucked everybody.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They stole millions of dollars, right?
*  What ever happened with all that?
*  I don't know, but I think they were
*  very connected in certain areas.
*  What I heard.
*  Yeah.
*  So nothing happened.
*  Not good.
*  Nothing happened.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah.
*  Got robbed.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of people lost money.
*  It was like a Bernie Madoff type deal almost.
*  That's right, for comedy, yeah.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's.
*  We'll handle your money, Colin.
*  Don't worry about it, Colin.
*  We'll handle your money.
*  I mean, and we were so stupid.
*  And I remember Brett Butler telling me,
*  look at these assholes.
*  Talk about Spotlight.
*  These guys come in here to rob us.
*  And I go, I was thinking, like,
*  what do you have to, they're our friends.
*  We see them every night at the club.
*  Why would you think they're here to rob?
*  They're doing business, they take their percentage.
*  That's what I was thinking.
*  Yeah.
*  Meanwhile, six months later, I'm like, oh, shit.
*  They came right in.
*  They come to the.
*  Because that's what's so great when people are robbing you
*  is they're not, they're coming in like friendly.
*  They're hanging out with you as friends.
*  Yeah.
*  They're going to the diner.
*  They're bringing all that human being shit.
*  And then they fucking rob you the whole time.
*  They're sociopaths.
*  Yes, yes.
*  Sociopaths are amongst us.
*  They're sociopaths.
*  They do exist.
*  They do, and many of them are successful in business.
*  Well, we talked about them last night,
*  like joke thief sociopaths.
*  There's a bunch of them too.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  They're sociopaths.
*  That's what it is.
*  That's how they can do that.
*  Well, they disassociate themselves
*  from what they're doing.
*  The same thing with those pathological liar.
*  That guy Dean, he didn't think he was going to kill her.
*  He's like helping her.
*  Like they're not thinking,
*  I mean they know they have to cover it up.
*  Same with joke thieves.
*  They think they don't think they're joke thieves.
*  They're like, no, no, I'm just, I'm inspired.
*  Or they think everybody does it,
*  or they think everybody's influenced.
*  What was the story with the spotlight?
*  Can you find that?
*  What did they do?
*  I don't think it healed the money.
*  I don't even think it became a thing.
*  I think it was just we knew about it.
*  I bet it's not even in an article.
*  So they were connected?
*  Is that what the deal is?
*  That was the word.
*  And it seemed like when I look back,
*  I'm like, oh yeah, that makes sense.
*  Shady.
*  Like they were just, you know.
*  So much shady.
*  I knew them all, yeah.
*  I see them all the time.
*  Yeah.
*  And they were just.
*  Shady motherfuckers.
*  Yeah.
*  Hanging out with your vampires.
*  And I remember the leader,
*  I don't remember his name,
*  but he looked just like,
*  remember that movie Angel Heart
*  when De Niro plays Louis Cipher, Lucifer?
*  He looked like him.
*  Yeah.
*  You ever hear that Zach Brian song,
*  Damn Cold Vampires?
*  No.
*  It's a great fucking song.
*  It's about that.
*  It's a great song.
*  It's about the industry.
*  It's Cold Damn Vampires is the name,
*  but he says these damn cold vampires is the song.
*  Yeah.
*  It's trying to build an empire
*  off the things that they can take.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all it is.
*  It's they're building an empire off of other people's work.
*  All they're doing is just.
*  And comedians, I guess other people,
*  but comedians are really the easiest
*  because we're not business people.
*  We don't have a business mind.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So it's like, they look around and they go,
*  and they probably think to themselves like,
*  hey, if they want, like any thief thinks,
*  if it was that important to them,
*  they wouldn't leave it out there.
*  Boo.
*  So just take it.
*  They didn't ask about the check, take it.
*  Right.
*  Because we get sidetracked
*  and we all have like some kind of.
*  Well, if you're in a corrupt business
*  and everybody else is corrupt too.
*  And in show business in the early days,
*  it was all corrupt.
*  It was all mob run and everybody was,
*  everybody was in cahoots.
*  Everybody was robbing, yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  I mean.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  Wild business.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, so we were on that.
*  So the Greg Giraldo thing was like,
*  Greg and I would just hang out
*  in the parking lot all the time.
*  I got, I knew him in New York,
*  but I really got to know him on the set.
*  Great guy.
*  It's just how some guys when they die,
*  you just go, no.
*  Just no, no, no, no, no, not that one.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I know, I know.
*  And he was, yeah.
*  I mean, he was, I'd see him every night for years
*  and he was a great guy.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you know Brody?
*  Yeah.
*  Brody Stevens?
*  I knew Brody when he worked at the cellar.
*  He used to be the, the balker at the cellar
*  when we had to drag people in the cellar.
*  He was the balker.
*  He'd be great at that.
*  He was great at it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, he was a good dude too.
*  He was another one.
*  When he went, I was like, no.
*  Just no.
*  I know.
*  Just no.
*  What did he die of?
*  Suicide.
*  Oh no.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's one where you just go,
*  maybe if you saw him the night before
*  and gave him a hug and told him how fun he was
*  and how much you love him,
*  maybe it would have helped a little.
*  You know, you always think things after the fact.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, he had gone through some episodes
*  where he would go off his medication
*  or he'd get a little crazy and then he'd bite back on.
*  And then every now and then he'd just catch that groove
*  and he'd be on stage and he would be on fire.
*  I remember one time I was at the Improv
*  and it was a late, late show.
*  It was like a 10 p.m. show.
*  I think my spot was like 1130.
*  So I do my spot and the show's over.
*  There's fucking 80 people in the crowd.
*  It's one of them deals.
*  And then Brody is gonna close the show
*  and they introduce Brody.
*  Brody takes his shirt off
*  and he's swinging it around overhead with music.
*  Like they're playing music.
*  He's swinging around and walking through the crowd.
*  He's like, energy, positive energy.
*  So I'm swinging his shirt around and he goes on stage
*  and he starts playing drums on the stool
*  and everybody's going crazy.
*  And then he goes into his material,
*  818 till I die.
*  And everybody's dying.
*  I mean, he just took over the room.
*  And I remember saying like,
*  he does so many of these late night sets
*  that he just comes on with his big energy
*  and he just recharges the whole room.
*  Everybody loved Brody.
*  That's the kind of, yeah.
*  That's like, well, let's say Chris Farley thing
*  where they would just come in and change the energy, right?
*  Change the energy of the room.
*  The whole energy was just like, whoa.
*  And it's like, you can't pull it off unless you're them.
*  Like if you say, I'm gonna be that guy,
*  and you try it, after like 30 seconds, you just fade.
*  They just, it brought more out in that.
*  They're just organically that way, you know?
*  Exactly, yeah.
*  Like you said about Dickless Dave.
*  Yeah. Same thing.
*  Same thing. People start smiling.
*  Yeah, totally could have been a comic.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's interesting how few people go down the path.
*  You know, it's just such a weird,
*  if you're gonna really,
*  if you wanna be successful in life,
*  it's not a good road.
*  No.
*  There's so many weird obstacles to it that it's crazy.
*  And you really have to get hardened.
*  It's like every other business, I'm sure you're successful.
*  You, a little bit of your innocence about humor
*  has to die too.
*  Right.
*  Because you have to really, it's a business for you too.
*  And as much as we love it,
*  and I love watching comedians and being a comedian,
*  and I love watching comedians doing their bits
*  and working it out, it's still, you have to really be tough.
*  You have to be tough to be a comedian.
*  Something in you has to be able to tolerate a lot of shit.
*  That's for sure.
*  You gotta be able to tolerate bombing,
*  tolerate bad nights.
*  Bombing. Everything.
*  If you can tolerate bombing, that's people's biggest fear.
*  Yeah, you can tolerate a lot in life.
*  That's people's biggest fear.
*  And we've literally had to stare in the face of a bomb
*  more times than anybody can imagine.
*  I mean, it's literally been over a hundred times in my life
*  where I've had people hating my guts.
*  Over a hundred times.
*  A whole group of people.
*  Everyone's worst fear.
*  Yeah.
*  What year did you start?
*  84.
*  Wow, so you were in the boom boom.
*  I came in 88, which is like a little after the boom.
*  The boom was kind of like dying off when I started.
*  But that boom in 84 must've been bananas.
*  Well, for me, I was new, so we didn't even think of it.
*  We just thought, oh, this is how life is.
*  And suddenly, two years in, you're making money.
*  Not a lot of money.
*  It wasn't like Boston.
*  I always say, we were joking about it last time,
*  my clock paid real money,
*  and all the guys were getting robbing us.
*  And, but yeah, but it was such an exciting.
*  I mean, just imagine, I tell people,
*  you have a comedian, they go, what?
*  You're a comedian?
*  What?
*  Like it would just blow people's minds
*  that you were in comedy.
*  And then, you know, a few years later,
*  people are like, oh, my cousin's a comedian.
*  So and so.
*  Yeah.
*  But at the time, it was blowing people's minds.
*  Did they have open mics when you started?
*  Oh yeah, that's the only way we get on, yeah.
*  How many, where'd you go?
*  The Paper Moon.
*  There's a place called the Paper Moon.
*  Eddie Brill was running this place.
*  Eddie Brill?
*  Yeah.
*  So Paper Moon, we started working out there.
*  I started working out there, you know,
*  and weaseled my way into it and started working out.
*  And I would bring crowds.
*  Where was the Paper Moon?
*  I was a good bringer.
*  Yeah?
*  I bring all my friends, cause I grew up in New York.
*  Right.
*  So my friends would show up, you know.
*  Where was the Paper Moon?
*  On West, it's where the Boston Comedy Club became.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Downstairs.
*  Oh, downstairs.
*  Downstairs.
*  Oh.
*  It was really cool.
*  Boston Comic Club was a great spot.
*  We were so innocent.
*  Yeah.
*  We just thought, you know, we had a sound guy
*  and we're like, hey, we're gonna do film.
*  We tried to do films and we just so,
*  everybody's so innocent when you start, you know?
*  Yeah, I'd never wanna do it again, but I'm glad I did it.
*  Yeah.
*  Like starting something like that from scratch.
*  Imagine at your age, trying a new thing like that.
*  Yeah, people do do that, it's crazy.
*  Like, how do you have the energy?
*  I guess it's their dream.
*  Yeah, you can't, you can't,
*  what you said is exactly right.
*  The energy to sustain.
*  Yeah.
*  All those drives to bomb for bad money
*  and then, like you said, you had a day job.
*  And also.
*  I had a day job too.
*  You had to make it,
*  because you didn't have any options.
*  Yeah.
*  The only way you were gonna make it
*  is if you had options.
*  My friends that all kept a full-time job
*  and didn't give up on that job,
*  never made it as a comic.
*  I don't know one who kept a full-time job
*  and then got to a certain point in time
*  where they could retire from the job
*  and then maintain the same level of comedy
*  as their peers.
*  Yeah.
*  No one did.
*  But a lot of people didn't make it.
*  And they were funny.
*  Yeah.
*  But they just,
*  it's so many layers.
*  I guess every job is like this,
*  but we just know it from comedy.
*  Well, it's just interesting talking to someone like you
*  that I've known for so many years.
*  I mean, I think I first met you 30 years ago.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like, we've known each other for so long.
*  You need to think about how wild this ride we're on is.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  I mean, it's crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  It really is.
*  And what's crazy with what you're doing
*  that I think is really interesting
*  is like, you're still doing stand-up,
*  but you've also decided to do these one-man shows.
*  Right.
*  And they're fucking amazing.
*  Thanks.
*  And are you, do you plan these?
*  Like, how do you, when you decide to make one,
*  like the most recent one, like how do you,
*  do you have a theme in mind when you sit down?
*  Well, what happened with this thing I just did
*  was I had a theme in mind
*  and it just wasn't going the way I wanted.
*  So then I said, I said, these psychiatrists,
*  and I go, oh, that's my theme.
*  I want to do it in front of psychiatrists.
*  So then the theme, the show was built around psychology
*  and how we've cracked up as a society
*  based on social media and everything else,
*  two psychiatrists.
*  So I'm performing to them, but they set the theme.
*  They made the theme exist
*  by me thinking about performing for them.
*  So when you first set out to write this set,
*  you decided you were going to do it
*  in front of psychiatrists?
*  No, I tried to do something else and it wasn't working.
*  And then I was going to, the theme was going to be,
*  I don't know what the theme was going to be,
*  like small talk at one point, then social media.
*  And then I happened to accidentally do a show
*  with four psychiatrists who were in the audience together.
*  So I go, ah, I kept referencing back to them.
*  And then suddenly I was like,
*  that's what I want to do, a show in front of psychiatrists.
*  So how far into the creation of the set were you?
*  I mean, probably 50%.
*  But it all connects to psychiatry
*  because it's all psychological.
*  That's amazing.
*  That's amazing.
*  And the ones you've done before.
*  Yeah, those were the theme, yeah.
*  And do you, like, how do you do it?
*  Do you sit down and just write it all out on a computer?
*  No, I go out, like, the Constitution show
*  is a perfect example.
*  I went every night to the Creekin Cave
*  in Long Island City and Rebecca directed it.
*  So every night I go, because I was like,
*  I want to do a show at the Constitution
*  because I was, everybody loves the Constitution
*  on every side of every issue.
*  Everybody's like, Constitution's a great document.
*  So I just wanted to do a whole show on the Constitution
*  because I was like, yeah, why is it great?
*  And so I just would work it out at Creekin Cave
*  all the time, just in front of four people, seven people.
*  Rebecca will tell you, 10 people,
*  I never did it in front of more than 12 people probably.
*  Wow.
*  And eventually began the show, you know.
*  So you just didn't announce that you were doing it,
*  you just kind of show up and do it?
*  I announced it, people just didn't draw for it.
*  Really?
*  No way.
*  I've never been a giant drawer.
*  I'm really a comics comic.
*  If the whole world was comedians,
*  I'd be the biggest, I'd be selling that state.
*  That's what I'm saying, dude,
*  you're one of the best comics alive.
*  Thanks.
*  You really are.
*  But I'm only for comedians.
*  I'm trying to talk you into staying tonight.
*  I didn't really know that I needed to coax you last night.
*  I just didn't want to bother you.
*  No, I was just being like, I was being the-
*  I would have coaxed you, now I know.
*  I'm gonna coax you from now on.
*  I was being the guy that's like, hey.
*  Now you're in trouble.
*  I don't care if you're tired, if you just ate,
*  you're going on stage now.
*  Now I know the game, I didn't know the game.
*  I thought you just wanted to hang out, something.
*  I didn't want to bump people and be weird.
*  When I come to clubs,
*  a lot of times I just want to hang out.
*  I just didn't want to bump people.
*  I don't know what you're doing.
*  There was no bumping.
*  I know, but I thought Ron Ma was coming,
*  I didn't want to be like, they gotta jump in.
*  Come tonight, come tonight.
*  Maybe, if I could change my flight.
*  Change that fucking-
*  Let's see if I can change it.
*  We'll change it, we'll get a guy.
*  Maybe tough.
*  We'll change it.
*  What?
*  Where are you going again?
*  Seattle.
*  Everybody's going to Seattle.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  They get free needles.
*  It's a good spot.
*  And if you get the right time,
*  they might take over the whole CD block.
*  You get to be a part of that.
*  They did again in Portland.
*  Did they do it recently?
*  Yeah, another one.
*  Portland just did another one.
*  They took over something, it's all over the news today.
*  Aw, didn't get the love that
*  One Place did.
*  What'd they call it again, Jamie?
*  The Zone.
*  No, the Chaff, Chaff, no.
*  Yeah, something like that.
*  Something Zone.
*  Chaff, Chaff.
*  Chad.
*  Chad.
*  Chaz.
*  Chaz, yeah.
*  C-H-A-Z.
*  Yeah, like Chaz Bono.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what it was, it was like the Chaz.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  The Hill Occupied Protests.
*  It's probably the club-
*  Autonomous Zone.
*  Autonomous Zone.
*  Autonomous Zone.
*  Autonomous Zone.
*  Remember the fucking mayor got on TV
*  and said maybe it's a summer of love?
*  Like, okay, baby.
*  What?
*  And then they booed him, was he the one they booed off?
*  It was a girl, it was a lady.
*  And then the guy from Portland was trying to join in
*  and they booed him off.
*  Oh yeah, they lit his house on fire.
*  They fucking, they said you have to resign.
*  Everybody has to resign.
*  This is a comedy.
*  Yeah, because he tried to go along with them
*  and then he's like, you know what, this is bullshit.
*  We need cops.
*  Like yeah, aw.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Aw, now you know?
*  You didn't know before you needed cops?
*  And you're the fucking mayor?
*  Holy shit.
*  Holy shit.
*  Not good, kids.
*  Well, we'll see.
*  If I can change my flight, I'll come back.
*  Change your fucking flight.
*  God damn it, Colin Quinn.
*  What's up, Boston?
*  I got to practice.
*  Well, there it is.
*  2024 cycle.
*  Yeah.
*  This is amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  This is amazing.
*  I love the set too.
*  It's fucking perfect.
*  Yeah.
*  That's just, you know those gigs they have, the bands?
*  Yes.
*  Oh man.
*  You know?
*  What is this on?
*  Is this on Netflix?
*  YouTube.
*  YouTube, beautiful.
*  It's out right now.
*  Yeah.
*  It says, what is it called?
*  Colin Quinn.
*  Our time is up.
*  Our time is up.
*  You know how therapists always go, our time is up?
*  Bam, beautiful.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Do you think that was a good name or should I have called it?
*  No, perfect.
*  I was gonna call it 50 Minute Hour.
*  They say that about therapy too.
*  That's not bad.
*  This guy's a therapist, you believe this?
*  Yeah, is that guy a therapist?
*  This guy's a real therapist.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know why they have to blur out my sneakers.
*  What is that?
*  Why they blur out your sneakers?
*  Is it a brand?
*  For real?
*  I don't know.
*  Who blurred it out?
*  You saw that too, right?
*  Yeah, who blurred it out?
*  That's ridiculous.
*  What?
*  It looks like something's blurred out.
*  It's not a sneaker, it's something at that part of the stage.
*  Oh, maybe it's the lighting or something.
*  Yeah, that's weird.
*  Makes it more weird to blur it out.
*  That's weird.
