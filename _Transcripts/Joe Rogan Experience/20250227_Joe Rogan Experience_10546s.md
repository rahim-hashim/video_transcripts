# Joe Rogan Experience #2280 - Peter Berg
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6.0s)]
*  Are we up? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10.0s)]
*  All right, we're rolling. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=15.0s)]
*  Those are a lot. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=17.0s)]
*  Is this too much? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=18.0s)]
*  They're delicious. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=19.0s)]
*  Am I making a rookie mistake? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=20.0s)]
*  No, I love them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=21.0s)]
*  They're too good though. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=22.0s)]
*  There's a lot of sugar in them. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=23.0s)]
*  They're trying to make one with no sugar. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=25.0s)]
*  They're pretty close. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=27.0s)]
*  But right now that's got a ton of sugar in it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=28.0s)]
*  But damn, it's good. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah, they taste good. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=31.0s)]
*  We did the full thing today, dude. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=32.0s)]
*  Thanks for the workout. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=34.0s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=35.0s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=36.0s)]
*  Thanks for the work. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=37.0s)]
*  You're a beast. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=38.0s)]
*  For anyone that doesn't know, you are a fucking beast. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=39.0s)]
*  And I suspected you would be. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=42.0s)]
*  That's why I wanted to work out. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=44.0s)]
*  And I was smart enough. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=46.0s)]
*  And I told you right away, I'm not going to keep up with you. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=48.0s)]
*  But man, you go hard. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=50.0s)]
*  You did a lot of the things though. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=52.0s)]
*  You did all the stuff. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=54.0s)]
*  And stuff that you'd never done before, like windmills. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=56.0s)]
*  Yeah, those windmills. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=59.0s)]
*  You could really get in trouble with the windmill. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=60.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=63.0s)]
*  For people that don't know what that is. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=64.0s)]
*  You certainly can with heavyweight. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=65.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=66.0s)]
*  But all those things, like the push-ups and body weight squats, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=67.0s)]
*  it's all just a gift to build to it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=70.0s)]
*  I love the way you warm up. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=72.0s)]
*  Because I'm the same way. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=74.0s)]
*  I do a long warm up every day. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=76.0s)]
*  And my buddy Ari got me into it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=78.0s)]
*  And just try and stretch absolutely everything. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=81.0s)]
*  And I was telling you, I got thrown off a horse in Africa a month ago. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=85.0s)]
*  And when I was in the process of getting thrown off, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=89.0s)]
*  and I was like in the middle of the air. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=92.0s)]
*  And I'm about to come down and I'm like, oh shit, this is going to be a problem. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=94.0s)]
*  And I thought about those warm ups. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=98.0s)]
*  And I landed and rolled and didn't hurt myself. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=100.0s)]
*  So I think those are really smart. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=103.0s)]
*  Yeah, if we could just appreciate when your body works well [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=105.0s)]
*  without having to be injured, it would be so nice. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=109.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=111.0s)]
*  Because you really only think about your, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=112.0s)]
*  God, I hope my body heals. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=113.0s)]
*  When you get injured, if you get fucked up, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=115.0s)]
*  then you think, God, I can't wait to get healthy again. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=117.0s)]
*  But if you just appreciate, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=120.0s)]
*  and the best way to appreciate your body working well is to keep it working well. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=122.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=126.0s)]
*  Just to work on it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=127.0s)]
*  Like stretch out, work out, lift weights, get some cardio in. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=128.0s)]
*  Do the stuff that's uncomfortable, like stretching. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=132.0s)]
*  I like that you started off your workout with a nice long stretch. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=135.0s)]
*  We had a good stretch. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=138.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=139.0s)]
*  And a good ice bath, man. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=140.0s)]
*  Yours is colder than mine. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=141.0s)]
*  That blue cube is brutal because it's always running. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=142.0s)]
*  That's like a flowing river. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=145.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=147.0s)]
*  That's hard. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=148.0s)]
*  Great. It was a great way to start. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=149.0s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=150.0s)]
*  Yeah, it gets you fired up, man. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=151.0s)]
*  And also, like we were saying, your workout's done. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=152.0s)]
*  Your day can, you're free. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=155.0s)]
*  You don't have to think about doing it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=157.0s)]
*  Just get it out of the way early. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=158.0s)]
*  You're good. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=160.0s)]
*  Well, and the sauna and the way you approach, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=161.0s)]
*  the way I think you approach all of it is kind of a meditation. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=163.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=167.0s)]
*  And I know that that's probably really an important part of your creative process. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=168.0s)]
*  It is a mind when I'm writing or directing to be able to have that time alone. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=173.0s)]
*  And it's a moving meditation. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=178.0s)]
*  And I think one of the secrets to your success, in my opinion, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=181.0s)]
*  is that you know how to take that time for yourself. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=186.0s)]
*  Lock in, focus, get mentally and physically ready, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=189.0s)]
*  because it's not easy to do what you do every day and to be this present. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=192.0s)]
*  So I respect it so much. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=196.0s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=198.0s)]
*  Well, obviously, I'm a huge fan of what you do. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=199.0s)]
*  And fucking American Pride Mule is so good, dude. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=201.0s)]
*  Thank you, man. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=205.0s)]
*  I feel like you made it just for me. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=206.0s)]
*  I've been waiting for a realistic Wild West series like that forever. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=208.0s)]
*  And that is, I'll just say it right now, that's the best one that's ever been made. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=214.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=218.0s)]
*  It's the best representation of the Wild West that's ever been made. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=219.0s)]
*  It's so good, dude. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=222.0s)]
*  It's so brutal. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=224.0s)]
*  My wife checked out after episode one. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=226.0s)]
*  Did she? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=228.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=229.0s)]
*  She's like, I can't, because we watch shows before we go to bed. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=230.0s)]
*  And we're in the middle of Severance, which is excellent. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=233.0s)]
*  Really good show. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=235.0s)]
*  And Severance is, you know, I mean, there's some brutal moments, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=237.0s)]
*  but it's just really complicated. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=240.0s)]
*  It's really engaging. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=242.0s)]
*  You've got to pay very close attention. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=243.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, really good show. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=245.0s)]
*  And then I said, hey, baby, we've got to watch American Pride Mule. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=246.0s)]
*  I go, Peter's coming on. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=249.0s)]
*  Please sit and watch with me. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=250.0s)]
*  The first episode, she's like, Jesus Christ, what the fuck are you doing to me? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=251.0s)]
*  It's like 10 o'clock at night. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=255.0s)]
*  I got to go to bed. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=256.0s)]
*  I can't, like, people getting tomahawked in the fucking head. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=257.0s)]
*  I got to go to sleep. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=261.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=262.0s)]
*  If I have to call her or send her flowers or anything, I will. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=263.0s)]
*  I've had to send a few people flowers and give them, like, massages and stuff, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=267.0s)]
*  like therapy treatments, because it's traumatizing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=272.0s)]
*  Because you did it right, that's why. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=276.0s)]
*  Because you did it right. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=277.0s)]
*  You did it like it really was. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=278.0s)]
*  It was a fucking barbaric time in a barbaric place. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=279.0s)]
*  And it's never really been other than 1883, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=283.0s)]
*  Taylor Sheridan's series, which is also excellent. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=288.0s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=291.0s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=292.0s)]
*  He did a fantastic job. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=293.0s)]
*  And how crazy is it that, like, Faith Hill and what's the other guy's name? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=295.0s)]
*  Tim. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=300.0s)]
*  Tim McGraw. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=301.0s)]
*  They're fucking great actors. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=302.0s)]
*  They're fucking great actors. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=304.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=305.0s)]
*  Tim was in Friday Night Lights. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=306.0s)]
*  Do you remember him in the movie? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=307.0s)]
*  He played the father, like the mean alcoholic father who used to beat up his kid. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=308.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=313.0s)]
*  Tim was great in Friday Night Lights. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=314.0s)]
*  Tim's a very good actor. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=316.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy that someone who's a great singer [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=317.0s)]
*  can all just slide into this other thing and be amazing at it? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=319.0s)]
*  He's an artist. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=323.0s)]
*  I mean, he's a really deep-thinking, deep-feeling artist. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=324.0s)]
*  Yeah, clearly. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=327.0s)]
*  And Taylor, Taylor shared a little bit of his experience with Tim McGraw. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=328.0s)]
*  Yeah, clearly. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=332.0s)]
*  And Taylor, Taylor Sheridan has a knack for getting great performances out of people like [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=333.0s)]
*  McGraw. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=338.0s)]
*  Or did you see Jerry Jones, his cameo in Landman, which I think is the best cameo ever? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=339.0s)]
*  Have you seen that yet? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=344.0s)]
*  What episode is it on? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=345.0s)]
*  I'm not sure because I don't know each episode, but he's got, Sheridan has a sequence where [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=346.0s)]
*  Jerry Jones basically playing himself just tells the story of how he got into business [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=352.0s)]
*  and how he started up and it's just beautifully done. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=359.0s)]
*  Sheridan's very good at getting people to do cameos and pulling it out of him. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=363.0s)]
*  I think that show was like, Billy Bob Thornton was built for that show. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=369.0s)]
*  It was born for it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=373.0s)]
*  That's his perfect role. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=375.0s)]
*  He's so goddamn good in that show. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=377.0s)]
*  In Landman. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=379.0s)]
*  Yeah, in Landman. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=380.0s)]
*  He's so goddamn good. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=381.0s)]
*  I mean, he's been good in a million things, but in Landman, it's like you just believe [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=382.0s)]
*  he's that guy. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=386.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=387.0s)]
*  I believe, but American Primeval, back to that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=388.0s)]
*  What inspired you to do such a realistic interpretation of that time? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=392.0s)]
*  Do you remember a movie called Jeremiah Johnson? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=399.0s)]
*  Did you ever see that with Robert Redford? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=402.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, a long time ago. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=404.0s)]
*  So Redford plays this city man who goes out west looking for gold and ends up sort of [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=405.0s)]
*  stuck somewhere around Montana and is trying to survive out there. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=411.0s)]
*  When the Indians first find him, he's so inept. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=417.0s)]
*  He's trying to catch a fish in a frozen river with his hands. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=419.0s)]
*  I mean, he's completely inept that they don't even waste an arrow on him. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=423.0s)]
*  They don't kill him. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=427.0s)]
*  And by the end of the film, he's a warrior and he's learned how to survive. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=428.0s)]
*  And he marries a Native American woman and his wife gets killed and he goes on a vengeance [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=433.0s)]
*  spree and kills a whole bunch of people and ends up getting this incredible respect. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=440.0s)]
*  From the Native Americans and my dad took me to see Jeremiah Johnson and that movie [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=446.0s)]
*  always stuck with me. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=451.0s)]
*  And I'm good friends with Taylor Sheridan and we work together a lot and I obviously [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=453.0s)]
*  know everything he's doing and I kind of wanted to see if I could play in that space. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=457.0s)]
*  But you know, he's doing it so well and so specifically, I kind of thought, well, what [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=462.0s)]
*  if I just did something that was really about the survival? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=466.0s)]
*  And I like to call it inch by inch filmmaking where you think about how hard it would have [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=470.0s)]
*  been just to go 50 feet and take a piss and how there might have been 15 different things [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=476.0s)]
*  that could have killed you on the way to taking that piss. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=482.0s)]
*  Instead of just jumping through those 50 things, let's really try and stretch it out and try [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=485.0s)]
*  and show people and capture the brutality of moment to moment living back in that part [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=492.0s)]
*  of America in the 1850s. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=499.0s)]
*  And you're used to doing films. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=501.0s)]
*  So what is the process like transitioning from something that's two or three hours to [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=504.0s)]
*  something that's long form? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=510.0s)]
*  You have all this time and multiple episodes to lay out the story, but you're doing it [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=513.0s)]
*  with the quality of an excellent film. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=519.0s)]
*  Everything starts with good health. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=521.0s)]

*  Check it out. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=586.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was a massive job. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=587.0s)]
*  A big movie is generally like 85 day shoot. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=590.0s)]
*  American Primeval is a 145 day shoot. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=595.0s)]
*  And I had one of my ideas with Mark Smith, who wrote the episodes and was very talented, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=599.0s)]
*  was let's not shoot in sound stages. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=607.0s)]
*  Let's not make parking lots look like forests, but let's go up into the mountains. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=610.0s)]
*  And in this case, we went up onto some different Indian reservations in New Mexico. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=617.0s)]
*  And we're like, let's really go out there for 145 days. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=622.0s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=626.0s)]
*  We were talking. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=627.0s)]
*  This is all prior to us going out and actually doing it. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=628.0s)]
*  And it's kind of like, be careful what you ask for. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=630.0s)]
*  You're actually really fucking on the mountain for 145 days. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=634.0s)]
*  And there's lightning storms and snow storms and wind storms. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=639.0s)]
*  And we had rattlesnakes everywhere. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=643.0s)]
*  And we had to have all these dudes going around pulling the snakes out of the rocks and stuntmen breaking ribs. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=645.0s)]
*  Joe Schilling was with us every day. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=653.0s)]
*  I think we killed Joe five times. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=655.0s)]
*  Thanks, Joe. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=657.0s)]
*  I saw Tate Fletcher. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=659.0s)]
*  I was telling you too. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=660.0s)]
*  It was episode two. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=661.0s)]
*  We only killed Tate once, but thanks, Tate, for that. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=662.0s)]
*  I love that dude. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=665.0s)]
*  But these stuntmen were so tough and breaking bones and all kinds of horrible things. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=666.0s)]
*  But the creative experience of getting to do basically six movies at once, because I directed all of them, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=670.0s)]
*  and being able to go that deep in characters and to be able to bring in elements like Brigham Young and the Mormon religion [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=680.0s)]
*  and have big themes circling around just very visceral, violent moments as a filmmaker is fucking awesome. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=688.0s)]
*  And it's different, you know, because it's not directing an episode of a television show is its own experience, but that's very quick. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=697.0s)]
*  Directing a movie is really, really wonderful and very obviously creatively demanding. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=705.0s)]
*  But this is six movies all at once. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=711.0s)]
*  And having to keep that in my head and kind of figure out how to keep myself functioning and not wasting energy. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=715.0s)]
*  And, you know, I built a gym in my house in New Mexico with a nice bath and a sauna, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=724.0s)]
*  and I'd get up at four every morning and just have that time for myself to keep myself fit and mentally and physically ready to go at it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=729.0s)]
*  When you're in the middle of a project and you're doing your workouts, are you just like constantly going over the show in your head? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=740.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I try to, I do go over it, but in more of an abstract way. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=748.0s)]
*  I'm a bit of an improvisational filmmaker, meaning I don't like to have everything super planned out. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=755.0s)]
*  I think kind of the way you conduct your podcast, you have some ideas and then you just sort of allow whatever happens to happen. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=762.0s)]
*  And I know what I'm going to do that day, particularly with American Primeval, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=771.0s)]
*  because we had so many big battles and stunts and kind of dangerous complex filmmaking that there has to be some plan. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=777.0s)]
*  But even within that, I try to loosely think about what I want to do and then get out there and let the actors kind of start doing what they do [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=786.0s)]
*  and see what kind of creative vibe gets going and allow the cameramen, you know, I just shoot handheld cameras. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=798.0s)]
*  So we have a lot of flexibility with how we can work and capture. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=804.0s)]
*  And my feeling is rather than plan it all out, go out there knowing kind of what you want to accomplish, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=809.0s)]
*  but allow kind of creativity, allow that kind of divine magic to enter the process, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=816.0s)]
*  which can kind of be freaky for like my bosses at Netflix because they're spending a whole lot of money and they're like, what are we doing today? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=822.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't really know what we're doing today, but we're going to do something. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=830.0s)]
*  But I've done it. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=835.0s)]
*  Well, they're pretty good at staying out of the way, aren't they? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=836.0s)]
*  They actually are fantastic about it. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=837.0s)]
*  And, you know, I have to give, you know, my boss, there's a woman named Bella Bajari at Netflix who and people talk a lot of shit about Netflix. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=840.0s)]
*  I'm not one of them. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=850.0s)]
*  I mean, they're giving so many people so much work and they, you know, once you convince them that you have a vision, they let you do it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=852.0s)]
*  And she was great and she let me do it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=861.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's interesting because there was a scene in the second episode of American Primeval where a Native American cuts the throats of five women. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=865.0s)]
*  Spoiler alert. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=877.0s)]
*  Sorry, spoiler alert. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=878.0s)]
*  I guess, sorry. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=880.0s)]
*  There's a lot of other bad things that happen, but there is this scene. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=881.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=884.0s)]
*  And, you know, Netflix is a very busy company. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=885.0s)]
*  They're making a lot of stuff. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=888.0s)]
*  And we were deep in the edit process and I got a call from Bella, the boss, my boss, and she's like, I want to see this show. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=890.0s)]
*  And I'm like, well, your show. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=898.0s)]
*  So please come in. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=900.0s)]
*  And it's hard for her to keep track of all the shows and all the scripts. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=901.0s)]
*  And I was impressed that she even wanted to come in. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=905.0s)]
*  And so she came in to the edit room and she's like, I'm going to watch one episode. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=908.0s)]
*  It's kind of a big deal. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=913.0s)]
*  She's, you know, very influential person in our world. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=914.0s)]
*  And so it's me and Hugo, the editor, and Bella comes in and we share we're showing her the first episode and we're just sitting in this kind of dark screening room. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=918.0s)]
*  I have no idea what she's going to say or do. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=925.0s)]
*  And it's pretty violent. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=928.0s)]
*  And it ends and she goes, I want to see another one. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=929.0s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, we'll start a plan the second episode. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=932.0s)]
*  And we're getting right to the moment where, spoiler alert, these women are about to have their throats cut. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=936.0s)]
*  And I'm starting to have a full fucking panic attack. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=942.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that she doesn't know what's coming up. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=946.0s)]
*  Right. And and Hugo, the editor, is kind of looking at me like, should I stop it? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=949.0s)]
*  I mean, and I really didn't know what to do. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=954.0s)]
*  And we get to the moment where this event happens and my body heat was was literally rising. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=957.0s)]
*  I'm ready for her to like fire me and take the show. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=963.0s)]
*  And I know the scene happens and the girls get their throats cut and she says, stop and we stop. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=966.0s)]
*  And she goes, Peter, I can sense you're concerned about my reaction. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=974.0s)]
*  Let me tell you something. I'm here for this violence. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=979.0s)]
*  I'm not afraid of this violence as long as you make it emotional and connect me to the emotion. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=981.0s)]
*  Do it. And I'm like, thank you, Bella. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=987.0s)]
*  And she left and she allowed us to explore the kind of grit and intensity that people have reacted to. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=991.0s)]
*  And I tip my hat to her for that. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1000.0s)]
*  You know, it's it's not you. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1003.0s)]
*  You need that kind of support to get something like American Prime Minister made today because it's not you know, it's not your grandmother's Western. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1006.0s)]
*  No, it's critical that you do it that way, because if people want to really know what that was like, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1016.0s)]
*  if you read the historical accounts of what happened, that's what happened for sure. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1023.0s)]
*  It happened that way. And you know, it was horrific. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1027.0s)]
*  One of the things that a lot of people have have talked about and I had, you know, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1032.0s)]
*  the LDS church issued a statement sort of critiquing the show and critiquing me, which I appreciate. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1037.0s)]
*  And I understand why members of the Mormon community would be offended by the portrayal of Brigham Young and the Meadows, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1044.0s)]
*  the Mount Meadows massacre, which was the event that we use as kind of our inciting incident for the first episode, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1053.0s)]
*  which was a real massacre that the Mormons committed on a group of pioneers who were heading out west or Mormon militia [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1061.0s)]
*  with some Pied Indians attacked and murdered about 140 men, women and children. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1070.0s)]
*  And we present that in the film and we present Brigham Young in the film. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1078.0s)]
*  And most many Mormons, it's interesting to start reading all the debate about it, but a lot of Mormons were saying, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1084.0s)]
*  yeah, this is exactly what happened and this is a part of our history. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1090.0s)]
*  And no other Mormons, particularly the seniors in Salt Lake City, were saying this is not what happened. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1094.0s)]
*  This is not fair. But what I find interesting about the Mormon church and about kind of how we present it is I've had a lot of people come to me and go, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1099.0s)]
*  dude, I never knew the Mormons were such savages. So gangster. They were fucking gangster. Brigham Young was, in my opinion, a gangster, a survivor, a warrior. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1110.0s)]
*  And for anyone who follows Mormon history, you know, they started in upstate New York with this young kid, Joseph Smith, who found these tablets and basically rewrote the Bible [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1122.0s)]
*  and started getting this following. And then they moved to Missouri and they got popular. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1133.0s)]
*  And then there was an extermination order and it was kill all the Mormons. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1138.0s)]
*  So they fled to Illinois and tried to survive up there at this place called Nauvoo that was going to be their peaceful place to live. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1142.0s)]
*  And Joseph Smith was murdered and they were run out of Illinois. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1151.0s)]
*  And Brigham Young led these dudes, men and women, on foot across the plains in the winter to Salt Lake Valley, which was this desolate wasteland. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1156.0s)]
*  And he said, oh, we'll stay here. They'll never come for us here. And they started coming. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1168.0s)]
*  And Brigham Young basically said, fuck it. We're not taking it anymore. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1173.0s)]
*  He built his own army, the Nauvoo Legion, and he said, we're staying here. We won't mess with you. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1178.0s)]
*  But if you come after us, we will fight. And that point, I think, is interesting. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1184.0s)]
*  And I think Brigham Young, who survived longer than all of them, and if you go to Salt Lake City, he did a pretty good job. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1190.0s)]
*  Right? Yeah. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1198.0s)]
*  That's a big city, man. It's a great city. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1199.0s)]
*  And I don't know. I respect the Mormon religion. I respect Brigham Young. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1202.0s)]
*  And I feel like we make him look like a gangster in American Primeval. And I don't know. He's a survivor. And I respect that. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1209.0s)]
*  Well, this is the reality of historical figures. You're talking about a different time in the world. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1221.0s)]
*  And it was a particularly barbaric time. And if you wanted to survive, this is what you had to do. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1229.0s)]
*  And this is we're not talking about the United States in 2025. We're talking about the Wild West. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1235.0s)]
*  And you're talking about a persecuted group of religious people. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1241.0s)]
*  Like, if you want to survive, you want your children to survive, you got to fight. You got to take up arms. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1246.0s)]
*  That's just how it is. Like, you know the story about the Mormons in Mexico, right? Remind me. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1250.0s)]
*  There's Mormon sects in Mexico that moved there when they made polygamy. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1256.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1264.0s)]
*  And this was a homeboy from Massachusetts, Mitt Romney. His family is from Mexico. His father was born in Mexico. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1265.0s)]
*  And his father could never be president because he wasn't born in America. And he was born here in America, ran for president, the whole deal, became governor of Massachusetts. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1274.0s)]
*  But there's still these huge groups in Mexico that are armed to the fucking tits because they're always constantly battling with the cartel. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1282.0s)]
*  And there was a series of murders a few years back where a woman and children like family were slaughtered. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1292.0s)]
*  And there was some confusion as to whether or not the cartel targeted them or whether it was a case of mistaken identity or what happened. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1298.0s)]
*  But, you know, there's been documentaries about them. They're fucking, they live in armed compounds. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1307.0s)]
*  The Mormons. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1313.0s)]
*  In Mexico. So it's a similar sort of a situation with them in Mexico now. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1314.0s)]
*  I mean, the polygamy was a thing. And, you know, we do touch upon that a bit in Primeval. I think Brigham Young had 40 odd wives. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1319.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1331.0s)]
*  How do you fucking keep up with two? I don't understand how someone could have two wives. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1333.0s)]
*  That's a whole other conversation. I mean, I have a friend who lives in Saudi Arabia. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1340.0s)]
*  And a long time ago, I was in Saudi Arabia doing some work. And I'd asked him, because in Saudi, you can have multiple wives, Saudi men. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1345.0s)]
*  And I'd asked him about that and sort of like, wow, that's amazing. Multiple wives. That's so cool. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1355.0s)]
*  And we were leaving. We were leaving Riyadh Airport. And he was walking with me and there was a man in front of us and he was holding like five suitcases. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1361.0s)]
*  And he could barely walk. And there were four women around him and kids everywhere. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1370.0s)]
*  And he just looked like he was about to collapse and fall face forward on the ground at the airport. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1375.0s)]
*  And I was walking with the airport in Riyadh and my friend looked at me and said, Pete, this is the reality of what having five wives looks like on the ground if you want to see what it really feels like. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1380.0s)]
*  So to think about Brigham Young having, you know, 45 wives. Okay. Good luck, I guess. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1391.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. But that that was one of the issues, the polygamy that people that were non-Mormons back in the 1850s were using to attack the religion. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1400.0s)]
*  And, you know, that was something that was the polygamy has obviously been since outlawed and the church has cut itself off from that policy. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1416.0s)]
*  But, you know, the Mormons were the whole idea that this kid Joseph Smith, I believe he was a young teenager, 14, 14. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1425.0s)]
*  Yeah. When he and his buddy walked into these woods in like 18 late 1830s. Right. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1434.0s)]
*  Like it was 1820. Okay. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1442.0s)]
*  When did he find when did Joseph Smith supposedly find these golden tablets? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1444.0s)]
*  I believe it was. But either way, early 56 wives. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1448.0s)]
*  Brigham Young had 56. There's a photo of him. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1453.0s)]
*  This is 16 he forgot about. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1457.0s)]
*  See, I didn't want to I didn't want to oversell it so I undersaw it. I kind of knew what was in the 50s. He had 56 wives. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1458.0s)]
*  46 kids only only for excuse me only 46 kids made it to adulthood. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1466.0s)]
*  Oh wow. Only 46. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1470.0s)]
*  He's basically Genghis Khan of Utah. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1474.0s)]
*  1823 he was visited by an angel who directed him to a buried book. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1477.0s)]
*  1823. And how old was he like 14. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1481.0s)]
*  So but so this kid at 14 and comes out of the woods and says the angel came and told me that the Bible's almost right, but it's not quite right. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1485.0s)]
*  So I'm going to rewrite it, which he did the Book of Mormon and look at where we are today. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1495.0s)]
*  It was not that long ago. Right. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1501.0s)]
*  And and in the course of that journey from Joseph Smith coming out of the woods to where we are today with Brigham Young University and the beautiful city of Salt Lake City, Utah. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1503.0s)]
*  There was a lot of bloodshed and Joseph Smith was murdered. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1517.0s)]
*  Brigham Young fought in another interesting theory that isn't proven, but it's I believe it. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1521.0s)]
*  It holds is what saved the Mormons because in 1857 when you had the Mormon Wars, you know, Brigham Young was fighting the president Buchanan and when the military was coming after him in 1857 and he was holed up and prepared to fight in Salt Lake City and Buchanan wanted him out. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1529.0s)]
*  And then right around 1858, 1859, little thing called the Civil War popped off and the entire focus of the U.S. military was not on Brigham Young and Utah, but it was on fighting the Civil War. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1548.0s)]
*  And before the Utah Church was able and Brigham Young was able to grow the Mormon Church and survive and thrive. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1563.0s)]
*  And he was able to politically negotiate a place in the government so that by the time the Civil War ended, Brigham Young was deeply entrenched and was able to lead the Mormon Church to the great power that it is today. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1571.0s)]
*  I think if the Civil War hadn't occurred, there would be no Mormonism in the United States. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1585.0s)]
*  Wow, that's crazy. What if we're two at his turn of events? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1591.0s)]
*  And I'm going to probably get ripped on for that one, but I believe it's supportable. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1594.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to get ripped for everything. That's okay. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1599.0s)]
*  That's just how it is. Mormons are the nicest people. My next door neighbors used to be Mormons. They're the nicest fucking people. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1601.0s)]
*  I agree. I completely agree. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1607.0s)]
*  They're so nice. I know a ton of Mormons because I know a bunch of people in Utah. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1610.0s)]
*  And Salt Lake City, Utah is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful state. Salt Lake City is a cool city. And like I'm down with the Sundance Film Festival. So I'm down with the whole state. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1614.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I love Utah, but it is a fascinating story. It's a fact. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1627.0s)]
*  And it's, you know, look, they have a great sense of humor because the Book of Mormon, when Matt Stone and Trey Parker did that musical, they took out a full page ad in the playbook. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1631.0s)]
*  So they're like, if you want to know more about Mormonism, come visit, like find out the real thing. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1643.0s)]
*  So instead of protesting and suing and attacking them, and they just took out a fucking ad. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1649.0s)]
*  I think that shows incredible character. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1657.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1661.0s)]
*  Because that fucking, you've seen the Book of Mormon, right? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1662.0s)]
*  Yes, I have. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1665.0s)]
*  Hilarious and pretty brutal. And they're like, well, if you like, you'd like to find out more about Mormonism. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1666.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can't figure out. Like I, when I was doing my research for American Primeval, I went to Salt Lake City and the Mormon Church gave me a tour. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1671.0s)]
*  And I told them what the film was about and that the Mountain Meadows massacre was in the book. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1683.0s)]
*  Was it going to be in our show? And they took me to the theater. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1688.0s)]
*  Have you ever been to the theater, the Mormon theater in Salt Lake City? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1693.0s)]
*  No. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1696.0s)]
*  Holds like 20,000 people. It is the most beautiful, incredible theater where they have weekly events and meetings. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1697.0s)]
*  And they took me in there and there's a huge pipe organ. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1706.0s)]
*  And I had a private concert with their organist. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1709.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's that. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1712.0s)]
*  Wow. Look at that place. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1713.0s)]
*  And I sat by myself in the center of that theater. And you see the pipe organs. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1715.0s)]
*  And they gave me a private concert. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1722.0s)]
*  And then they took me into the museum and showed me the history of the Mormon Church. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1726.0s)]
*  And I told them about the Meadows massacre, which I've taken heat for in the show. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1731.0s)]
*  And at the end of the tour, there's a bookstore in the museum, the Mormon Museum in Salt Lake. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1736.0s)]
*  And the book, Mountain Meadows Massacre, by this guy Turley was there. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1743.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I want to buy this book. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1748.0s)]
*  I read the book and I'm like, oh, for sure we're putting this story in our film. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1750.0s)]
*  And it was for sale in the Mormon bookstore. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1756.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1759.0s)]
*  And I met with the author, Turley, who then took me to the site of the Mountain Meadows Massacre. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1760.0s)]
*  And he had written the book with the support of the Mormon Church to get their side of the story out. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1766.0s)]
*  Did you film at the actual site? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1772.0s)]
*  No, we didn't. That was in, the actual site was in Utah. But I went and toured it. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1773.0s)]
*  So you filmed in New Mexico. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1778.0s)]
*  Yeah, we filmed everything on different reservations around Santa Fe. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1779.0s)]
*  But if you go to the site of the Mormon Meadows Massacre in Utah, the Mormons have built a big memorial there honoring 130 pioneers from Arkansas who were killed there. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1785.0s)]
*  And the Mormons have owned this event and they were very willing to talk about it, which is kind of like them buying a full page ad and Book of Mormon. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1798.0s)]
*  They're like, you know, we know you're going to make a film about the Meadows Massacre. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1809.0s)]
*  It's probably going to be inflammatory in some ways. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1814.0s)]
*  However, come visit us. We want to meet you. We want to show you. We want to play music for you. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1816.0s)]
*  And I had an incredible time with the Mormons that were involved with us doing the research for Primeval. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1823.0s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by The Farmer's Dog. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1833.0s)]
*  I've been asking dog owning friends what they feed their dogs, and most of them are surprised by the question. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1835.0s)]
*  And I get it. For decades, kibble was the only option. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1840.0s)]
*  But as humans have been eating healthier, companies like The Farmer's Dog started feeding dogs healthier too. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1844.0s)]
*  Because when your dog eats freshly made human grade food, owners notice a bunch of positive changes, including weight loss and higher energy levels. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1850.0s)]
*  Basically happier dogs. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1859.0s)]
*  Did you know that overweight dogs can live an average of 2.5 years less? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1862.0s)]
*  And did you know that 60 percent of dogs are overweight? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1867.0s)]
*  So when my friends say I just feed my dog kibble or whatever, I tell them, no, you got to think about this one. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1871.0s)]
*  You have to try The Farmer's Dog because no one, dog or human, should be eating highly processed food for every meal. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1876.0s)]
*  So try The Farmer's Dog today and get 50 percent off your first box of healthy, freshly made food plus free shipping. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1884.0s)]

*  The offer is for new customers only. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1899.0s)]
*  So what is the backlash, though, if they've admitted that this massacre took place and it's a historical part of the historical record? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1902.0s)]
*  The book is for sale in this Mormon theater. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1909.0s)]
*  What is the backlash? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1912.0s)]
*  The biggest single issue, if you get into the weeds, and I think it's an interesting point of debate, is whether or not Brigham Young knew and authorized this massacre. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1913.0s)]
*  And the way the massacre played out in real life was different how we did it in the film. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1925.0s)]
*  In the film, we did it in one swell move, like it just happens. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1930.0s)]
*  You know, we filmed it in one shot and it's pretty intense, visceral, very fast events. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1935.0s)]
*  And then it's over. In reality, this wagon train was surrounded by the Mormon militia, the Naboo Legion and some of these Native Americans. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1941.0s)]
*  And it went on for about four or five days. And the Mormons dressed up as Native Americans. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1950.0s)]
*  This is where it gets kind of some Mormons aren't thrilled that we pointed out the fact that they were trying to put the blame on the Native Americans. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1956.0s)]
*  So they literally, Mormons dressed up as Indians to confuse the pioneers. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1964.0s)]
*  And in case there were survivors to say, oh, it wasn't Mormons. It was the Native Americans that did this. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1969.0s)]
*  So they don't love that. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1974.0s)]
*  But what what the Mormons claim or some in the Mormon Church claim is that during the three or four days that the siege took place before the actual massacre. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1976.0s)]
*  And the details of the massacre are really fucked up because the Mormons pretended they were accepting a surrender. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1985.0s)]
*  So they went in with white flags and they said, OK, the men walked this way, the women and children were going to walk you to safety because the Indians are going to kill you. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1991.0s)]
*  Mormons said, we're here to save you. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=1999.0s)]
*  So they started walking them out. And then on someone's signal, they just killed everyone. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2001.0s)]
*  Really bad. But the issue of whether Brigham Young knew about it or didn't know about it, we imply that he knew about it. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2006.0s)]
*  We never say that he authorized it, but we imply that he did know about it. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2015.0s)]
*  And what many of the defenders of Brigham Young will say is that there was a letter written where Brigham Young said, do not harm these pioneers. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2020.0s)]
*  Don't don't kill them. But the letter was sent by horse while the massacre, while the event was already occurring. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2030.0s)]
*  So I've had people say he knew that that letter wasn't going to make it there in time. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2039.0s)]
*  He was covering himself. Oh, hey, I wrote a letter. I knew it couldn't get there in time, but I wrote a letter. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2044.0s)]
*  So there's plausible deniability. No one knows. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2049.0s)]
*  It's hard to believe if you really start getting into this. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2052.0s)]
*  And obviously I did. I know it's not on the top of everyone's list of things to give a fuck about. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2055.0s)]
*  But it's really hard for me to believe that in 1857, a group of Brigham Young soldiers would act unilaterally on their own and commit a crime that's horrible without somebody approving it. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2061.0s)]
*  It's hard. It's hard for me to imagine. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2073.0s)]
*  But so that's the single issue that tends to, you know, if if I do, and I really try not to like my girlfriends turned me on to read it. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2076.0s)]
*  I never even really knew what it was. Oh, my God. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2087.0s)]
*  Like what? Like Reddit is fucking crazy. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2092.0s)]
*  Yeah. I was talking to, you know, Jack Carr, right? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2097.0s)]
*  Mm hmm. He's he's getting into, you know, making movies and he's doing all this cool stuff at the Terminalist. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2102.0s)]
*  And I think he's a great guy. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2107.0s)]
*  And he was talking to me about reviews because it was the first time he was ever getting reviewed. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2110.0s)]
*  Right. And, you know, any filmmaker who says they don't read the reviews is lying. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2115.0s)]
*  OK, they're just fucking lying. And they we do read reviews and we care and they hurt, you know. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2120.0s)]
*  And and he's like, I guess he's gotten, you know, read something he didn't like on the Terminalist. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2127.0s)]
*  And he's just called me. He's like, how do you handle this shit? I want to kill this. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2133.0s)]
*  He's freaking out. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2139.0s)]
*  And I'm I mean, I'm not he wasn't really freaking out that bad, but he was pissed. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2141.0s)]
*  And I'm like, Jack, you know, welcome to the world of what we do. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2145.0s)]
*  People are going to are going to talk. I'm like, I'm like, you don't understand what like before Reddit and and comments and all the things. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2149.0s)]
*  Back when we first put movies out, man, there were three critics that mattered. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2158.0s)]
*  Like when I first started making movies, there was this guy, Kenneth Turan, and in the L.A. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2164.0s)]
*  Times, there was Janet Maslin in the New York Times. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2169.0s)]
*  And then there was Siskel and Ebert. Right. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2172.0s)]
*  And like they had so much power. Right. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2174.0s)]
*  So you you'd make a movie and you'd spend tens of millions of dollars and you put your heart and soul and you're like, we never try to make bad movies. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2178.0s)]
*  Right. Like that's that's never the goal. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2187.0s)]
*  We're always like, you know, we want to win something. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2189.0s)]
*  It's hard to make a good movie. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2192.0s)]
*  But you put all your your heart and soul into these movies. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2194.0s)]
*  And then it's fucking three critics that control your fate. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2198.0s)]
*  Right. And I was telling Kara about, you know, my first movie was called Very Bad Things. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2202.0s)]
*  It was about this bachelor party that goes haywire. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2208.0s)]
*  That's a great movie. Appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2211.0s)]
*  I love that movie. So that movie got hands down the worst review ever given to a movie in the history of film reviews. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2213.0s)]
*  Please don't pull it up right now. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2222.0s)]
*  But feel free. Anyone listening? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2224.0s)]
*  Kenneth Turan's review of my film, Very Bad Things in the Los Angeles Times. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2226.0s)]
*  OK, I read this review. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2231.0s)]
*  I literally vomit like people talk about vomiting. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2234.0s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever vomited when something bad happens. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2237.0s)]
*  I puked. I went into like shock. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2239.0s)]
*  I'm like he tried to destroy my career and he like it was. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2242.0s)]
*  And so I'm telling Jack that I'm going pull it up right now. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2247.0s)]
*  Pull it up. And he starts reading it. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2250.0s)]
*  And he's like, oh, my God. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2252.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2257.0s)]
*  I go, don't fucking tell me about bad reviews. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2259.0s)]
*  OK, because I got the worst. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2262.0s)]
*  And Kenneth Turan, who, like after I'd gotten that review, I was in a bar at the Four Seasons Hotel [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2264.0s)]
*  in Los Angeles getting drunk with a couple of my friends. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2271.0s)]
*  And Kenneth Turan was in the bar. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2274.0s)]
*  And I got up and started moving towards him. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2276.0s)]
*  I was in a blackout rage. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2279.0s)]
*  And my friend Joe and Mike Mendelson held me back because I was going to get him. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2281.0s)]
*  And for three films after that, Kenneth Turan, he just had it out for me. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2288.0s)]
*  This guy hated me. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2294.0s)]
*  And finally on I believe it was either Friday Night Lights or Lone Survivor, he reluctantly gave me a good review. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2296.0s)]
*  But it was more like a broken clock is right twice a day. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2304.0s)]
*  But like nowadays, like I said to Jack, it's like, OK, if you the crazy thing about if you are focusing on how your work is being perceived and it matters and it does matter. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2308.0s)]
*  I could say anyone who says it does and I think is kind of lying. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2322.0s)]
*  Don't you think it matters more about the audience than about the critics? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2326.0s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2330.0s)]
*  My perspective on critics is that no one wants to be a critic. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2331.0s)]
*  Generally, they wanted to be creative, but they're not good enough for sure to contribute. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2335.0s)]
*  They don't have anything to contribute. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2341.0s)]
*  And they're they're using a different standard that doesn't really apply to just like the working human being. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2342.0s)]
*  It just wants to be entertained. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2348.0s)]
*  And that's why I said to Jack, I go, dude, like like we have Rotten Tomatoes, right, which is a way of critics. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2350.0s)]
*  If you get 61 percent good, you get a fresh tomato. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2356.0s)]
*  If not, you're you know, you've got a rotten tomato and that that sucks. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2361.0s)]
*  OK, I've got a rotten tomato. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2365.0s)]
*  That sucks. Oh, I got a fresh tomato. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2367.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2369.0s)]
*  But now they have the audience score right next to the critics score. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2370.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2374.0s)]
*  And that's the one that I said, Jack, don't look at the critics. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2375.0s)]
*  Look at what your audience is saying. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2378.0s)]
*  And that's when, you know, like I learned about Reddit and all that stuff. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2380.0s)]
*  And I'm like, fuck the critics. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2384.0s)]
*  I'm down with this Reddit shit because you get such interesting conversations. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2386.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2391.0s)]
*  And they're much more thoughtful, I think. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2392.0s)]
*  And they've taken away the power, you know, and I'm not shitting on critics. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2395.0s)]
*  I get it. You want to be a critic. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2400.0s)]
*  Whatever. You know, I do like the quote about critics in my book. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2402.0s)]
*  I don't go to the critics about critics and life doesn't go to the critic. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2407.0s)]
*  It's the man in the arena. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2410.0s)]
*  I like that quote and I believe in that. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2412.0s)]
*  And I've used that to justify my mood when I get a bad review. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2414.0s)]
*  I'll just read the man in the arena over and over until I feel good. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2419.0s)]
*  Is that Theodore Roosevelt? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2422.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2423.0s)]
*  That's a great quote. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2425.0s)]
*  Great quote. Fantastic quote. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2426.0s)]
*  And it's true. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2428.0s)]
*  It is absolutely true that, you know, to do to do people that do, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2429.0s)]
*  you know, I was just talking to Dana White and about something that I actually want to mention to you. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2436.0s)]
*  But and the my love of a guy like Dana is the the doer of it all. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2446.0s)]
*  The guy who just says, I don't care what the critic says. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2452.0s)]
*  I'm going this way. I am fucking going this way. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2456.0s)]
*  And if I win and you're with me on the ride, you're part of me. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2460.0s)]
*  If I lose and you're still with me, you're my friend. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2464.0s)]
*  If not, I don't give a fuck. I'm going to do it again. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2467.0s)]
*  And I have I have so much respect for that. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2470.0s)]
*  And and I'll tell you another interesting thing about my business that never it never. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2473.0s)]
*  It always surprises me how real it is. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2481.0s)]
*  But when you make something, a movie or you do something, whether it's American Premiere, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2484.0s)]
*  almost anything I've done. And I don't know if you've ever experienced this. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2489.0s)]
*  You know, you put yourself on the line so intensely and and you believe in it with your heart and your soul and you go for it. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2492.0s)]
*  And as it's getting ready to come out, there's this weird thing that happens where everybody separates from you. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2501.0s)]
*  And you're the one that's kind of now you're about to be judged. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2508.0s)]
*  It's going to be determined to be successful or a failure. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2511.0s)]
*  It's going to get reviewed. And everyone's kind of like, good luck, Pete. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2515.0s)]
*  Good luck. And I could like like the day or two before it comes out, all the people like. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2522.0s)]
*  And this is when you know who's got your back. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2528.0s)]
*  OK, because there's a few you look around and like, well, all these people were with me for this journey. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2531.0s)]
*  And I'm all by my fucking word. Where'd everybody go? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2536.0s)]
*  And it's, you know, like my sister, my best friend, Ari, my dog, my son. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2541.0s)]
*  There's a few people who are really right there. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2549.0s)]
*  And then and then when it comes out and it works, man, you have a lot of friends. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2552.0s)]
*  And and and that's, you know, just one of the things that you have to do in this business. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2559.0s)]
*  And it's why the critics fuck them. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2567.0s)]
*  And it's why Dana and people like that, you who do, you know, create it and build it and make it. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2570.0s)]
*  And it's real. You definitely need feedback because you definitely need to know if you're on the right track. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2577.0s)]
*  But you can get lost in feedback. You can get lost in positive feedback, too. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2584.0s)]
*  You get lost. You can get lost in people approving you and you can get drunk in it. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2588.0s)]
*  I don't read anything. I don't read anything about me. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2595.0s)]
*  No reddits ever. Nothing. I don't read anything. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2598.0s)]
*  I just I get it. Like sometimes I'm good. Sometimes I'm not as good. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2601.0s)]
*  That's I get it. I do my best. That's all I can do. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2605.0s)]
*  And I feel like if you're really self-critical, which I am, and you're your objective and you analyze yourself and you're brutally honest, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2609.0s)]
*  you have to be brutally honest about what you've done and how it is. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2619.0s)]
*  Could you have done it better? Is there anything? Did you cut corners? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2623.0s)]
*  And if you don't, if you don't cut corners and if you do your best and you really prepare, that's all you can do. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2627.0s)]
*  You just do your very best. And if you haven't done your best, that's when the critics really sting. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2633.0s)]
*  If you know that you kind of slacked off or you weren't focused or there's something that was wrong with what you did. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2637.0s)]
*  Or you just did it for the money. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2644.0s)]
*  That can often. Yes, I agree with that. To do it for the money is a real, real one. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2646.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, that's the downfall of Robert De Niro. Yeah. Right. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2650.0s)]
*  He needs money for divorces. You know, he's got marital problems. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2654.0s)]
*  And so I spend a lot of money and he starts doing these fantasy movies with Michelle Pfeiffer and like bizarre shit. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2658.0s)]
*  Or he's like, you're like, what is Robert De Niro? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2664.0s)]
*  One of the greatest actors of all time doing these fucking goofy ass movies. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2666.0s)]
*  You get extended. I agree with you that like what I always say is I do a lot of research for my films and, you know, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2670.0s)]
*  have went to Iraq with Navy SEAL Platoon and lived on an oil rig and went back to high school for Friday Night Lights. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2678.0s)]
*  And I found that if I whenever I put that work in and I put that research in and I really, with the exception of very bad things, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2685.0s)]
*  which was a fantasy about a bachelor party gone haywire, which Kenneth Turan didn't like. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2695.0s)]
*  It did hurt me. It did. That review. But I was younger. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2700.0s)]
*  But if I do stay true to my instincts and my passion and I follow it, A, the work seems to connect much, much better. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2705.0s)]
*  And I don't I don't feel if somebody doesn't like it or wants to talk about it or debate it. OK. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2715.0s)]
*  It's I don't it doesn't hurt me. Yeah, that's experience. Right. I think so. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2721.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And any time I've done a job for the money and there have been a couple, it's it's backfired horrifically. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2725.0s)]
*  And the money was never worth it. Right. The the the the reviews did sting worse because you agreed with them. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2732.0s)]
*  Yeah. They were right. Yeah. I was lazy. I didn't give a fuck. I was, you know, I cared. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2742.0s)]
*  I still I didn't phone it in, but I wasn't locked in. Right. And that's the difference. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2747.0s)]
*  And yeah. And I think one of the reasons you don't have to read your shit is because you know you're locked in. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2752.0s)]
*  You just are. And that's why you're connecting and and locking in. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2759.0s)]
*  And I say it to filmmakers now because so kids are so confused, young kids that want to become filmmakers, you know, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2767.0s)]
*  that they they think they're, you know, they're going to work hard and they're going to make these movies and they're going to put their heart and soul into them. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2774.0s)]
*  And people are going to watch them. And then they go on and they see TikTok videos that are getting, you know, 400 million likes. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2780.0s)]
*  And someone's just, you know, live streaming them like making toast. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2788.0s)]
*  And they're like, wait a minute, what the fuck is happening? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2795.0s)]
*  And I say, look, all you can do is control your passion, your work, your discipline and believe in something and put the work in. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2797.0s)]
*  And I believe that the results, you know, will will take care of themselves. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2808.0s)]
*  But it's it's weird, you know, for for filmmakers today and to try and figure out how how to what's going to penetrate and what's not going to penetrate. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2813.0s)]
*  And yeah, I remember when when I did that that series about opioids, painkiller and, you know, that pretty heavy issue. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2822.0s)]
*  And we worked really hard on that. And I was very, very proud of it. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2833.0s)]
*  And we came out number one on Netflix and we were number one for like six, seven days around the world. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2837.0s)]
*  And on the eighth day, we were number two. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2843.0s)]
*  And the number one show was a documentary made on cell phone footage about the Johnny Depp, Amber Heard divorce trial where people were just in the parking lots. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2845.0s)]
*  And that was the number one show on Netflix in the world. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2856.0s)]
*  And I'm like, whoa, wow. Like, you know, they probably made that for twenty five thousand dollars. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2860.0s)]
*  If that and that everything is sort of there's this great parody now. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2867.0s)]
*  And I'm like, and it's confusing. But I'm like, did you just have to work harder? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2872.0s)]
*  Yeah. And if you're not telling the truth, you're going to have a harder time. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2876.0s)]
*  You can't be in the business of getting the most attention because human beings are easily distracted, easily amused. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2882.0s)]
*  We like a lot of things that have zero quality. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2892.0s)]
*  And just because we're watching it doesn't mean it resonates with us. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2894.0s)]
*  Just because you're watching the Amber Heard trial doesn't mean it's changing the way you feel about things. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2896.0s)]
*  Really entertaining you and not just entertain you, but stimulating you in a way like, wow, like that was a fucking masterful piece of cinema. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2901.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's there's a difference, you know. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2911.0s)]
*  And yeah, there's going to be a bunch of people that just watch people unbox cell phones or eat octopus. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2913.0s)]
*  You know, this like there's weird videos that get a lot of likes. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2919.0s)]
*  But you're not in the business of attention. You're in the business of art. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2922.0s)]
*  And I feel like when it comes to paying attention to comments and critics, I feel like if you're locked in and if you're doing your best, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2925.0s)]
*  if you don't if you're one of those people that don't need to be checked on, some people need to be checked on. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2935.0s)]
*  Some people get off the rails, they get a little full of themselves and they need a little something to just like set them back. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2942.0s)]
*  You need someone to say that one sucked like, God damn it. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2947.0s)]
*  And then you work harder. But if you're working as hard as you can. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2950.0s)]
*  This is my advice that I give comedians when it comes to comments and things like that and negativity. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2953.0s)]
*  You only have so much attention and think of your attention attention as if it was a number like you have 100 units of attention. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2961.0s)]
*  Now, if you're spending 30 units paying attention to comments and negative articles and criticism, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2971.0s)]
*  that's 30 units you can't use for something that you love. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2979.0s)]
*  That's there. And then also it probably bleeds into your thoughts when you're doing those things that you do love, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2983.0s)]
*  particularly like devastating negative reviews and comments and things that are like really hurt you that hurt your feelings. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2990.0s)]
*  Take a lot of numbers. Yeah, it's just bandwidth. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=2997.0s)]
*  You're robbing yourself of your ability to do the things that you love. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3001.0s)]
*  You're robbing yourself of your ability to pay attention to your family, your ability to contact your friends and reach out and to be present. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3006.0s)]
*  Because you're thinking, oh, my God, I can't believe he hated my movie. Oh, my God, I can't believe, you know, I bombed. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3015.0s)]
*  Oh, my God, I can't believe this podcast sucked. Whatever it is, you're robbing yourself. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3021.0s)]
*  You can only do your best. And if you're doing if you're not doing your best, you probably need those comments. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3026.0s)]
*  You need something to wake you the fuck up and get locked in. But if you're locked in, you don't want it. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3032.0s)]
*  You should know. I know if I talk too much. I know if I interrupt too much. I know. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3039.0s)]
*  And I'll drive home and like, I hate you. You don't need to be. I don't need it. I fucking hate me. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3043.0s)]
*  I'm my number one critic. So I don't pay attention. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3051.0s)]
*  And this is something that I had to figure out over the years. But when when I knocked it down to a formula of attention bandwidth, that's when I really understood it. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3055.0s)]
*  Because I'm like, OK, the times, even distractions, like the times that I'm spending just scrolling through Instagram and looking at nonsense like that hour is a valuable hour to write. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3066.0s)]
*  I could have been doing like real good things with that hour where I feel good about it or I get nothing. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3078.0s)]
*  Just just distraction, just nothing, which is fine. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3084.0s)]
*  Sometimes if you're on a fucking airplane or something like that, you're going to do like, who cares? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3087.0s)]
*  Is it really ever fine? Do you think? I think it's OK sometimes. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3092.0s)]
*  Because barely barely as a comedian, I think there's a value in having your thumb on the pulse of culture and even the chaotic, you know, fucking unboxing videos and food and stupid shit. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3094.0s)]
*  And people just sticking their ass out. Right. And Insta hose. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3107.0s)]
*  Like there's there's a value in keeping your thumb on it. You just have to know when your thumb's getting burnt. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3110.0s)]
*  I don't think there's a value in Insta hose. I don't. I don't. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3115.0s)]
*  I actually don't. And I've I've gotten pretty good at like just removing that from my life. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3119.0s)]
*  But I was challenging the boxing. OK, yeah. People putting shit in boxes. Maybe eating, eating asparagus, I guess. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3125.0s)]
*  I do enjoy cooking videos. I think there's value in that. I love watching chefs prepare food. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3134.0s)]
*  Where do you stand on? And this is something I talked to a lot of writers and filmmakers about. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3139.0s)]
*  Like, just being quiet is really important. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3145.0s)]
*  And and being for me, the most creative experiences I've ever had have come far away from any stimulation, from any controlled thinking, from allowing ideas to come to have like, you know, like the divine, the divine spirit, the angels that are creativity that require a certain amount of quiet and space for those to emerge, at least for me, they do. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3150.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I try to make space because I so agree with the bandwidth. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3178.0s)]
*  And you're right. But more than anything, just turning it all off. Yes. Can be so inspiring for me creatively. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3183.0s)]
*  Yeah. One of the most disappointing things that I've ever done, the most is some of the most disappointing things is when I sit down from my computer to write and I wind up looking at my phone and I just scroll and bullshit. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3193.0s)]
*  And then I start writing, but I'm distracted and I get an email or a text message comes through. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3205.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, yeah, I'll text him. And I'm just distracting myself. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3209.0s)]
*  And then I realized, like, after an hour and a half, Scott, I just fucking wasted an hour and a half that I could have written something that could have been a new brilliant bit. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3212.0s)]
*  It could have been a new thing that I'm really excited about. Instead, I just fucked off. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3221.0s)]
*  Yeah. So my creative process, like I just I just wrote a script that will be my next film. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3226.0s)]
*  And I wrote it in a very locked in zone. I try to find a way of locking myself into a pattern when I'm writing. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3234.0s)]
*  But it involves the key for me is getting up about 445 at the latest, but usually right around. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3242.0s)]
*  I'm crazy about it. So I'll set my alarm for 545 to the same song every morning that wakes me up. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3250.0s)]
*  This script was Van Morrison. And from I will go right. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3256.0s)]
*  I'll take a piss and then I'll get a cup of coffee and then I'll go right to my writing room with no phone, no stimulation, nothing until I put in, you know, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3260.0s)]
*  usually about two and a half to three hours of just pure mental focus, no distraction, no conversation, no news, no phone, no nothing. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3270.0s)]
*  Why do you like to do in the morning? Because I think when you actually like studying writers and their writing habits, I believe that, you know, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3282.0s)]
*  if you've had a good sleep, a sober sleep and an intention sleep, meaning you go to bed with some plan of what you want to write tomorrow. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3291.0s)]
*  So I want to write a film about Marines. I want to write the landing at Okinawa in World War Two, which is part of the story. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3300.0s)]
*  I know I'm going to write the actual landing scene. I go to bed with that intention. I might even write that intention down. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3309.0s)]
*  You wake up, your mind is like at its most fertile. It's like a calm pond, you know, like a mountain pond that's absolutely flat and like glass and reflective and beautiful. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3315.0s)]
*  And in the morning, it's at its most calm, your mind. And then I believe that every bit of stimulation you put into it is like a pebble or a rock being dropped into that water until the water starts getting all churned. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3329.0s)]
*  And that's what happens to our minds by, you know, 11 o'clock in the morning. If you've been, you know, plugged in and communicating, your mind is just a fucking feral, you know, boiling cauldron of acid. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3341.0s)]
*  This is how I think of it. So I like early morning, super calm. I can find the ideas. And I tend to if I lock in like that, I write at a high level and kind of to your own level. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3356.0s)]
*  And I think that's a fair point about like critic proof. I know it's good. I because I know it came from the deepest place I have. And it's like, well, okay, if you don't like that, then you don't like me. Sorry. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3371.0s)]
*  Which is fine. Yeah, I can handle that. Yeah. But like, I know that, you know, versus, you know, writing a little bit here, working a little bit there and then going out to lunch and then sitting in a cafe and, you know, coffee shop and kind of writing. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3384.0s)]
*  I just don't think that's deep work. Yeah. And I have noticed that like rappers and a lot of people in the hip hop community have been working on a documentary about Rihanna for quite a while and spent a lot of time with her in the studio. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3399.0s)]
*  And it's amazing the hours that hip hop performers, you know, musicians and rappers keep because they're going into the studio at two o'clock in the morning and working till, you know, one in the afternoon and then sleeping all day. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3415.0s)]
*  And that that were that nighttime and I've talked to her about it. She's just extremely creative late at night. Almost for me, the exact opposite. But like, I like, do you like to work creatively at night? Yeah. Can you write comedy at night? Yeah, I write when I get home. Wow. Yeah. So what I do is I do shows and then I come home and everyone's asleep. My whole house is asleep. So it's quiet and you can access. Yeah, because my mind is really stimulated because I just performed, you know, and, you know, I just maybe I've had a different [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3432.0s)]
*  drink or two and I sit in front of the computer and I just start thinking. Really? Yeah, I just start thinking. I just try to freestyle with thoughts. And the way I write is I just I have a topic and I just start with just essentially an essay and not an essay that I think anybody's going to read. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3462.0s)]
*  An essay is just like my thoughts, just rambling thoughts. And then maybe I'll rewrite a paragraph, but I'll keep the same paragraph above it to reference and then I'll rewrite it again. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3478.64s)]
*  Like what kind of subject? Like anything, whatever it is, technology, how it's affecting our lives and what our future is going to be like. And then I'll sit down with that and think about the pros and cons. And like, what do I really what hasn't every society faced this? Like, would you want to go back and live in the caveman days again? No, definitely. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3487.8799999999997s)]
*  Not would you want you. Do you want to live in a time with no penicillin? No, no, no, no, no. Like, so how much technology is too much technology? And I'll just start writing and out of that, I'll get a bit out of that. I mean, not always maybe one out of 10 times. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3508.56s)]
*  Sometimes something's useful. Like there's a lot of times I'm just throwing shit against the wall. But the key is throw a lot of shit. You have to throw a lot of things. You know, Hemingway famously said my friend Ari Shafiri has this on his laptop. It says the first draft of everything is shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3524.76s)]
*  I've heard such a great quote. It just sits on his laptop. And I love it. I love that. It's so true. And I just write, I just write. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3542.08s)]
*  But when you're when you're writing, like, because I was just watching you as you were speaking, you were you were looking up at the sky, like for an idea. Do you do you think about your your writing intellectually? Okay, I'm thinking this thought, okay, I'm gonna write it down, or your hands on the keyboard, and you're just channeling. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3549.92s)]
*  It's both, you know, sometimes just sitting there thinking about it before I write or in the middle of writing like is this right? Am I correct? Is this how I'm looking at this? Or am I trying to force this? And then I also write on a computer that is not connected to any apps. It doesn't have anything on it. The only thing it has on it is it has it's a mic, it's a think pad. So it has a you can't distract yourself. Right? I can I am allowed to Google things to find out if something's correct. That's it. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3569.12s)]
*  There's I've never I don't go to websites. I don't look at it. This laptop is just for writing. It's connected to the internet, which is a tricky thing. But there's a rule. So my home computer is there's no rules. I might watch YouTube videos. I might fucking watch a little Netflix. It's you know, IMAX. So it's big screen. I might do all kinds of stuff on that computer. But when I'm writing, my laptop is only for writing. And so there's there's I don't allow myself there's no tick [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3598.76s)]
*  tock. There's no Instagram. There's no nothing. I don't ever look at anything else. I just write and I use the browser the I use fucking Bing, which is like who searches shit on Bing. You know, it's good enough to find out what's real and what's not real. That's the only time I use it. That's it. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3628.76s)]
*  And do you experience like euphoria when you're writing on occasion? Do you blow your mind? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3647.64s)]
*  Well, you know, these ideas are not they're coming from fucking the ether. They're coming from somewhere. I know that creativity is an individual thing and it varies. But for me, my best ideas seem to come out of nowhere. It's like I don't even know if they're my ideas. They're coming from some place. And this is the concept of the muse, right? Like the muse is [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3653.3599999999997s)]
*  bestowing upon you these beautiful gifts of creativity. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3676.52s)]
*  Steven Pressfield. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3679.72s)]
*  Yes. Yes. The War of Art. Amazing book. I've got a stack of them out there. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3680.8s)]
*  I love him. He's a big inspiration. Yes. He's incredible. And he's just a brilliant guy. But that that's where it's at. It's just like setting this table showing up and then trying to pull these things from this other dimension. This wherever the fuck they're coming from. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3685.92s)]
*  And then I get these little nuggets and then the nuggets are transferred to my phone. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3706.7599999999998s)]
*  I feel bad for people who never get to experience that. Yeah. You know, I keep a necklace with with a dog tag and a quote from a William Blake poem. And he said with that that has always just helped me quite a bit. And it's the only thing pleasing to God is the creation of beautiful and exalted things. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3711.88s)]
*  And I remember the first time I got to experience the power of writing and something. It was like literally a religious experience. I don't know what happened. I kind of blacked out. I lost track of time and I wrote eight pages and I looked at it. I'm like, I don't know where this came from. And I read it. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3736.92s)]
*  And I blew my mind and I felt like I was having almost a religious experience. And that quote when I read it, the only thing pleasing to God is the creation of beautiful things, the creation, being creative and being able to please God through creativity or have a religious and mystical experience that's not drug induced through your power of your creativity. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3756.24s)]
*  I think it's the greatest thing in the world. And it kind of saved my life because if I hadn't found writing and filmmaking, I don't I don't know what I would have done. I wouldn't have been. I mean, I don't know. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3786.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, that's why it's for you, because it feels so real and so powerful that without it, you feel like your life would be lost. Yeah. And that amazing. That's an amazing thing to find as a human being. If you can find something that you love so much that you can't imagine life without it like that, you would be lost.

*  Can I tell you about it's sort of a non sequitur? But I did want to I did want to mention and it sort of related to something I love because I love boxing and I own a boxing gym in Los Angeles, which was hands down the stupidest thing I ever decided to do in my life was, oh, it'll be cool to have a boxing gym and manage boxers and, you know, no, don't don't. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=3816.9599999999996s)]
*  It's awful. I mean, I love the fighters and so much empathy. But one of my fighters, Chris Van Heerden, his girlfriend is a girl named Cassandra Carolina, who I think I told you a little bit about earlier when we're working out.

*  just because I've I've been to his house. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4308.400000000001s)]
*  He's rich. He's still, you know, sharp. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4311.0s)]
*  That's good. He's handsome and he's well spoken and he didn't take his brain. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4313.68s)]
*  Right. He didn't take his brain. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4317.6s)]
*  The stories of, you know, like working class [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4318.56s)]
*  boxing gyms like Churchill Box in my gym in L.A., [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4322.12s)]
*  which I technically don't own anymore because it just was turning into such a headache. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4326.599999999999s)]
*  If you could see the day in day out trials and tribulations [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4330.48s)]
*  that these fighters go through. Oh, yeah. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4334.64s)]
*  And you know it from UFC. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4336.28s)]
*  I think that boxers have it like harder. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4338.08s)]
*  I think I can't prove this. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4341.92s)]
*  But boxing is a more dysfunctional state than UFC, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4343.64s)]
*  mainly because of Dana. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4348.92s)]
*  And, you know, the fact that Dana has been able to monopolize it [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4350.4s)]
*  and that there's a system that you're a huge part of that that makes sense [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4353.799999999999s)]
*  and that there's good people involved at the top and and and on the [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4358.44s)]
*  on broadcasting and all of it. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4362.5599999999995s)]
*  Boxing has none of that. Right. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4364.44s)]
*  And so it's this broken, dysfunctional mess [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4366.32s)]
*  that is just begging for someone, hopefully Dana, to come in and and organize. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4370.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they are talking about doing that. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4377.28s)]
*  And Turkey Alashik, who is running Riyadh season, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4379.64s)]
*  has done a phenomenal job of putting together these incredible fights. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4384.08s)]
*  He's basically just said, there's a lot of resistance [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4387.56s)]
*  getting these top fighters to fight each other. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4390.12s)]
*  What's the resistance? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4391.76s)]
*  They want to maximize their earning potential by staying undefeated [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4393.160000000001s)]
*  and avoiding the really tough challenge. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4396.4800000000005s)]
*  Just give them the money now. Yeah. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4397.8s)]
*  And he's having all these fighters fight these dangerous fights. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4399.88s)]
*  And it's incredible for boxing. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4404.04s)]
*  Do you think that that there's a way for Dana and UFC to work with him? [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4406.48s)]
*  Yes. I mean, they're talking about doing that. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4410.639999999999s)]
*  How would that go? Do you think what would it look like? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4412.4s)]
*  Well, I mean, he obviously has an excellent relationship with them [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4414.8s)]
*  because, you know, Riyadh season helped promote the big event at the Sphere, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4420.4s)]
*  which was an insane so cool. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4425.88s)]
*  Have you fucking been to a I haven't been there, but I watched the UFC fight. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4427.88s)]
*  It's the greatest. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4432.599999999999s)]
*  You weren't there. I was the greatest venue in the history of anything. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4434.0s)]
*  But it doesn't overpower the experience. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4438.280000000001s)]
*  I don't know, man. It didn't overpower the fights. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4440.360000000001s)]
*  The fights were insane. They were so good. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4442.64s)]
*  But it was like the arena itself is so spectacular. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4444.76s)]
*  I would say go to see any band there you possibly can go to see anyone there. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4448.88s)]
*  It's so good. Yeah. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4452.52s)]
*  The graphics are so mind boggling. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4454.360000000001s)]
*  It's like you're on a drug. Yeah. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4456.76s)]
*  It's like you're having a psychedelic experience. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4458.64s)]
*  I mean, the moment I walked into it, I was like, you got to be fucking kidding me. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4460.6s)]
*  It's so I actually there's a video of me like I made a video. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4465.360000000001s)]
*  I wanted to film the my very first reaction. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4469.0s)]
*  The very first time I walked into it, it blew me away. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4472.280000000001s)]
*  What kind of drug? What kind of drug would you compare it to? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4475.400000000001s)]
*  It's like you're in a different dimension. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4477.84s)]
*  It's like this is mushroom, like a DMT. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4480.0s)]
*  Well, it's like it's it's so this is this is actually me walking. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4482.280000000001s)]
*  Give me some volume. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4486.4400000000005s)]
*  This is my first time ever being inside this fear. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4491.56s)]
*  This is it. Holy shit. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4495.68s)]
*  And this is just they're just practicing [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4502.400000000001s)]
*  and doing rehearsals of all the graphics packages. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4508.080000000001s)]
*  This isn't even the audience is even in yet. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4511.4400000000005s)]
*  This is insane. Oh, wow. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4516.280000000001s)]
*  And this is nothing compared to when they had the graphic packages running. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4518.4s)]
*  And I mean, it was unbelievable. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4524.12s)]
*  It's just the amount of money that it cost to put on a show there, though. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4527.24s)]
*  Do you think that like, is it going to be profitable? [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4531.759999999999s)]
*  Like, like, like, how do you make that money back? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4534.84s)]
*  Like, it's I don't know. How much did it cost? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4538.44s)]
*  I think the UFC spent something like [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4541.24s)]
*  twenty five million dollars over a normal budget for a for an event. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4543.679999999999s)]
*  But I was just think like, if you pay, I think it was Dolan. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4548.68s)]
*  It was the Madison Square Garden folks that put that deal together. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4551.16s)]
*  And I just I'm like, well, OK, it holds how many? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4555.96s)]
*  Thirty five thousand. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4560.2s)]
*  I don't think it's even that not that big. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4561.6s)]
*  And I just like they someone spent a lot of money on that screen. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4563.4s)]
*  Right. Yeah, that's a lot of technology. Yeah. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4566.88s)]
*  But so you thought you thought that Turkey, he did a great job. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4569.68s)]
*  But was Turkey involved in the UFC fight? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4574.56s)]
*  He was involved in Riyadh season, was a part of the sphere event. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4577.2s)]
*  It was co promoted by Riyadh season. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4580.28s)]
*  So in theory, Dana could work with him in some way and start. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4582.28s)]
*  That's the plan. And they own Ring magazine now. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4586.72s)]
*  So the reason why that's significant is the Ring magazine belt [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4589.72s)]
*  is one of the only belts that has kind of been. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4593.4400000000005s)]
*  It's there's a bunch of different organizations that are sanctioning bodies. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4598.32s)]
*  Is the WBO, the WBC, the IBF. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4601.96s)]
*  There's all these different. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4605.08s)]
*  It's very fractured. Right. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4606.36s)]
*  But Ring magazine has always been like Roy Jones, Jr. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4609.0s)]
*  was the Ring magazine, middleweight champion of the world, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4612.04s)]
*  the Ring magazine, super middleweight champion of the world. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4614.36s)]
*  Like that's the gold standard is Ring magazine. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4616.4s)]
*  So there would be one belt in this. Right. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4619.4800000000005s)]
*  If they can do that and then overpower everything else with money and then [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4622.12s)]
*  really put the compelling fights like did you watch this past weekend? [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4626.52s)]
*  Arter Bitterbeve and Dimitri Bivol. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4630.56s)]
*  What a fucking fight. Yes. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4632.92s)]
*  Probably the greatest light heavyweight fight of all time. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4636.0s)]
*  Incredible. Bivol trains in our gym, by the way. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4638.96s)]
*  Does he really? Churchill boxing. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4641.400000000001s)]
*  The hardest punch I've ever seen anyone throw in my life was in our gym. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4643.08s)]
*  David Benavides was sparring Bivol. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4648.8s)]
*  Bivol and David Benavides is a great fighter. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4651.200000000001s)]
*  But Bivol caught him and and dropped him with the jab. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4655.200000000001s)]
*  Inspiring. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4660.24s)]
*  Whoa. Inspiring. Bivol, incredible fighter. Amazing. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4661.92s)]
*  So is Benavides. So they're both are. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4665.36s)]
*  Those are actually two guys that I feel like could be could do it right. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4667.4s)]
*  But just having so much trouble getting a recognition that they deserve. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4671.28s)]
*  I mean, Benavides has been chasing Canelo forever. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4675.4s)]
*  Won't fight him. Yeah. For a good reason. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4677.719999999999s)]
*  That's a hard fight. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4680.28s)]
*  That's a hard fight. And you want that fight? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4681.759999999999s)]
*  You got to you got to get paid. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4684.0s)]
*  You got to get paid. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4686.0s)]
*  But I'm hoping that with Riyadh season. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4687.0s)]
*  Turkey would make that fight. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4688.88s)]
*  Right, because he signed a multi-fight deal with Canelo for four hundred million dollars. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4690.32s)]
*  I think it's a five fight deal for four hundred million dollars. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4694.64s)]
*  I think that's what's been reported. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4697.84s)]
*  I don't know if that's accurate. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4699.12s)]
*  But but Terrence Crawford's the first one. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4700.32s)]
*  Which is not really is that really happening? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4702.68s)]
*  Is Crawford Canelo fight? Yes, it's happening. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4704.96s)]
*  So what was going to happen was [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4707.72s)]
*  Terrence was Canelo apparently had made a deal with Jake Paul [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4710.6s)]
*  to fight Jake Paul. Ridiculous. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4715.8s)]
*  Ridiculous. But I bet it was for a significant amount of money. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4717.84s)]
*  Still ridiculous. Yeah. But fun. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4721.4400000000005s)]
*  I'd watch it. Look, Jake Paul wants to test himself against actual [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4724.84s)]
*  not just world champion, but one of the greatest of all time. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4729.04s)]
*  He would be if Canelo really fought and it wasn't fixed. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4731.400000000001s)]
*  Jake Paul would would not survive 45 seconds. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4735.12s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4739.8s)]
*  I think it would take a few rounds. Really? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4741.2s)]
*  Yeah. First of all, Jake is a lot bigger. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4742.92s)]
*  Jake's a lot bigger. But what would they what way would they? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4744.92s)]
*  Well, I don't think Jake is getting anywhere lower than 205 pounds. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4747.44s)]
*  He's a huge guy. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4751.24s)]
*  So Canelo would let him fight at 205. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4752.36s)]
*  I think that would be the case. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4754.5599999999995s)]
*  I think Canelo, when he got to 175, when he was fighting light [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4756.32s)]
*  heavyweight and he still fluctuates between 68 and 75, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4760.48s)]
*  I feel like he probably weighs 190 when he's walking around. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4764.32s)]
*  So he would probably weigh 190 and Jake would weigh over 200. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4766.919999999999s)]
*  They would probably fight either at cruiser weight [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4771.28s)]
*  or they would fight at heavyweight. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4774.0s)]
*  Didn't Tommy Fury like take Jake Paul? [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4775.56s)]
*  No, he beat him, but it was a very good fight. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4778.8s)]
*  It was a very good fight. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4780.84s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. But Tommy Fury versus compared to Canelo. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4781.64s)]
*  Right. Different levels, different levels. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4784.88s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt. Look, who's favored for sure. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4787.080000000001s)]
*  The greatest of all time. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4789.88s)]
*  One of the greatest boxers of all time and Canelo Alvarez. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4791.160000000001s)]
*  He's the favorite. But I'd like to see what happens. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4793.400000000001s)]
*  It would be crazy. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4796.6s)]
*  I like a little freak show every now and then. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4797.72s)]
*  As far as like, would you like to see? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4800.04s)]
*  I like a lot of freak show. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4802.200000000001s)]
*  Look, if Jake Paul wants to fight for the title, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4803.76s)]
*  I would like to see him beat top contenders in the light [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4805.56s)]
*  heavyweight division or whatever division he chooses to compete at [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4809.2s)]
*  and then eventually fight for a title. Yeah. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4811.8s)]
*  But are the fights even real? Like the Tyson fight? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4814.400000000001s)]
*  Like I saw video breakdowns of Tyson [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4818.04s)]
*  not throwing punches early on in that fight. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4821.84s)]
*  If you watched any of those videos were like, yeah, he's [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4824.56s)]
*  there's like a left hook is 100 percent available. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4827.56s)]
*  Tyson, you know, in training, 99 percent of the time [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4831.639999999999s)]
*  releases that punch and he held that. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4835.679999999999s)]
*  Like, do you think that that was a real was that a real fight? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4837.84s)]
*  It looked like sparring to me. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4840.799999999999s)]
*  That's what it looked like. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4842.639999999999s)]
*  But like with an arrangement beforehand. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4843.24s)]
*  I wouldn't want to speculate because I haven't talked to anybody about it. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4846.0s)]
*  But my educated assessment. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4848.92s)]
*  Agreed. Yes. Agreed. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4851.599999999999s)]
*  It looked like sparring. It didn't look like a fight. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4853.08s)]
*  And you think of Canelo and Jake Paul agreed to do it. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4855.44s)]
*  I don't think that would be that. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4858.639999999999s)]
*  I think that would be a bad. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4860.04s)]
*  Be a fight. That would be a fight like a sanction. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4860.96s)]
*  Real. Not enough to be a fight. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4862.76s)]
*  Yeah. I think Canelo Alvarez is making any agreements [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4864.4s)]
*  where he's not going to knock you out. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4867.84s)]
*  Well, he's not taking the fight, though, right? [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4868.96s)]
*  Well, this is what happened. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4871.24s)]
*  So they had this agreement and Jake Paul actually told me about the agreement [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4872.6s)]
*  when I met him at the inauguration. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4876.4s)]
*  We were talking about it. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4877.96s)]
*  And I was like, holy shit, it hadn't been announced yet. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4878.76s)]
*  I was like, that's crazy. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4881.04s)]
*  And then Turkey came along and said, fuck all that. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4882.56s)]
*  Let me throw some money at you and said, stop with all this bullshit. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4887.5199999999995s)]
*  You need to be fighting the greatest fighters in the world right now. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4890.92s)]
*  You need to be fighting Benavides. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4893.639999999999s)]
*  You need to be fighting Terrence Crawford. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4894.92s)]
*  So Terrence Crawford is first on the list and a lot of second on the list, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4896.4s)]
*  according to what I thought. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4900.88s)]
*  Oh, we should. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4902.12s)]
*  Most of my Crawford in September. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4903.32s)]
*  And they're going to have him fight Cinco de Mayo weekend against like a no name. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4905.08s)]
*  Right. All William Skull, SCU, LL. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4908.679999999999s)]
*  That's why I was asking. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4912.44s)]
*  I don't strip Canelo last year or unnamed. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4913.639999999999s)]
*  Do they have a date for Canelo Crawford? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4916.76s)]
*  Is it September 13th? Supposedly. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4919.240000000001s)]
*  But yeah, see, that's kind of crazy that they're going to have another fight [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4920.96s)]
*  beforehand, but it does give Crawford time to bulk up. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4924.280000000001s)]
*  So Crawford got on scale the other day. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4927.4400000000005s)]
*  He was one hundred and eighty five pounds. Really? Yes. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4929.0s)]
*  And he's doing deadlifts. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4931.160000000001s)]
*  He was doing deadlifts with 450 pounds. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4933.040000000001s)]
*  Crawford is a strong dude. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4935.400000000001s)]
*  I'm going to put Crawford in another success story of boxing. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4937.96s)]
*  I'm totally just contradicting myself. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4940.68s)]
*  Now I remember. You're right. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4942.56s)]
*  He's the I love the guy. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4944.160000000001s)]
*  He's fantastic. I know you've had him on. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4945.56s)]
*  Right. So a couple of times. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4947.400000000001s)]
*  He's so good. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4948.52s)]
*  And he's the best switch hitter in the game. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4949.4800000000005s)]
*  Maybe the best switch hitter since Marvin Hagler. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4951.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. He's phenomenal. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4953.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. And he's so intelligent. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4955.240000000001s)]
*  Like his his boxing is so clever. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4956.8s)]
*  He sets traps. How old is he? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4958.56s)]
*  Thirty six. Canelo's like 30. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4960.76s)]
*  So Crawford is 37. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4965.56s)]
*  Yeah, I'm looking at a thing. How old is Canelo? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4967.080000000001s)]
*  I think he's 35. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4969.280000000001s)]
*  Thirty four, 35. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4973.0s)]
*  He's still on his prime. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4975.72s)]
*  What's crazy is fucking better be of his 40 [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4976.360000000001s)]
*  and went 12 hard rounds where they never slowed down once. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4979.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's because people like you are getting us all in crazy shape. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4985.8s)]
*  These guys are living forever. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4989.4400000000005s)]
*  You're like teaching us the way to do that. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4991.52s)]
*  Very likely Terrence Crawford faces fighter with 90 percent [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4993.8s)]
*  KO rate after Canelo says De La Hoya. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4996.56s)]
*  Who would that be? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=4999.120000000001s)]
*  That's what I was looking at. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5000.240000000001s)]
*  What weight class would that be after? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5001.6s)]
*  So he must have fought a. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5003.56s)]
*  Oh, that's such a boxing headline, isn't it? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5005.160000000001s)]
*  Like 90 percent. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5008.4800000000005s)]
*  George Ortiz Jr. OK. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5009.4800000000005s)]
*  Virgil Ortiz Jr. is a savage. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5011.160000000001s)]
*  That would be a phenomenal fight. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5013.56s)]
*  That would be an absolutely phenomenal fight. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5015.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. After that, though. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5018.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, I saw his fight with Madrimov, who was very difficult, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5021.72s)]
*  who Crawford struggled a little bit with, too, but beat. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5025.240000000001s)]
*  And Virgil walked him down. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5028.64s)]
*  He was he was battering him towards the last rounds. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5030.56s)]
*  Why is Oscar De La Hoya offered an opinion on who Crawford would fight? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5033.6s)]
*  Oscar De La Hoya is not Crawford's manager, is he? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5038.84s)]
*  I don't believe so. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5041.76s)]
*  No, I don't think he has anything to do with you. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5042.76s)]
*  Watch Oscar seems like he's a little off the rails. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5044.240000000001s)]
*  You watch. OK, for sure. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5046.64s)]
*  And I mean, God love him. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5048.92s)]
*  And I think he's having a good time. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5050.96s)]
*  Do you watch his clap? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5052.92s)]
*  Like, OK, I know social media. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5055.0s)]
*  I said, don't scroll. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5056.76s)]
*  And certainly like Insta Hoes are bad. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5057.84s)]
*  My favorite Instagram account is Oscar De La Hoya on his clap back Thursdays. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5060.24s)]
*  Well, he. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5066.64s)]
*  And then he rips into Eddie Hearn, basically. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5069.2s)]
*  And it's it's deranged. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5072.28s)]
*  It's absolutely deranged, but it's funny. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5074.08s)]
*  And Oscar clearly doesn't care. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5077.28s)]
*  He does like to your point earlier. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5079.64s)]
*  He does not give a fuck. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5082.16s)]
*  And he just rips apart anyone and everyone. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5084.4400000000005s)]
*  And he does this thing every Thursday called Clap. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5089.0s)]
*  I think it's called Clap Back Thursdays. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5091.28s)]
*  And and that's my secret guilty pleasure. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5093.64s)]
*  My secret guilty pleasure is watching him dance around with a thong on. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5098.44s)]
*  Oh, that was out of his fucking mind. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5101.28s)]
*  The best. That was the best was fake abs. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5103.48s)]
*  It's a hell of a drug cocaine. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5106.64s)]
*  It's a hell of a drug. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5108.96s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5110.36s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, he's [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5112.32s)]
*  I mean, I like to say we've all been there. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5116.28s)]
*  I haven't been there. I haven't been there. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5118.12s)]
*  No, I haven't. I haven't. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5120.04s)]
*  The fish nets on. I've been here. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5121.4s)]
*  But I haven't been there. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5123.28s)]
*  OK. And, you know, like I do respect him. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5124.5599999999995s)]
*  I asked was a great fighter. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5129.2s)]
*  Phenomenal fighter. Phenomenal fighter. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5130.719999999999s)]
*  But I mean, come on now. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5132.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like Oscar De La Hoya and all that's coming with him and Eddie Hearn, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5135.04s)]
*  who I also like quite a bit. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5140.5199999999995s)]
*  And then you've got Al Hayman and Bob Arum, you know, is [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5142.44s)]
*  in his well into his 90s and is just going. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5146.5199999999995s)]
*  It's it's chaos. Yeah. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5149.24s)]
*  And and that's the problem is that they're represented by different promoters. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5150.96s)]
*  And it's very difficult for people to co-promote. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5154.5599999999995s)]
*  Very difficult for people to decide like who's the A side, who's the B side. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5156.879999999999s)]
*  You get ridiculous deals where, you know, this fighter wants 75 percent. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5160.16s)]
*  The other fighter was 25 percent. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5164.0s)]
*  They have to figure out whether or not they can make this happen. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5165.36s)]
*  And the fighters like, fuck that. I want it 50 50. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5168.04s)]
*  And then the promoters get involved. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5170.44s)]
*  And they don't want you to fight that guy, fight the number one mandatory contender. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5172.24s)]
*  And then these some great fights never take place or they take place too late. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5176.04s)]
*  Like Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5180.12s)]
*  They fought too late. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5183.44s)]
*  I mean, if that fight could have been arranged by Riyadh season, [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5184.76s)]
*  they probably would have caught both in their prime and it would have been chaos. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5188.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Manny was he was done before that. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5191.96s)]
*  Yeah. He also had a blown shoulder going into the fight. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5194.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You know, he needed shoulder surgery before the fight even started. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5197.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Have you? [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5202.36s)]
*  I have a little regret that I never had a professional fight. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5204.84s)]
*  And I was just in Mexico and my driver. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5208.679999999999s)]
*  So talking about boxing and my driver told me his son was a pro fighter [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5213.28s)]
*  and that if I wanted to and he told me how much it would cost, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5216.92s)]
*  I could come have a professional fight and his son would would let me win the fight. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5220.8s)]
*  And then and then but then I could have bought. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5225.88s)]
*  Well, but it would be a sanctioned fight. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5227.96s)]
*  And it would go I would have a box record score of one and oh, or oh, and one. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5230.2s)]
*  I mean, I could have not paid the money and like taken the loss, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5234.12s)]
*  but at least I would have had it. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5236.599999999999s)]
*  And I did think about it for like about, I don't know, maybe a minute. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5239.84s)]
*  And I decided not to do it. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5244.76s)]
*  Like you and I were talking like, I just can't take getting hit in the head anymore. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5246.44s)]
*  And, you know, when I was younger and I had the gym, I would I would spar more. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5252.8s)]
*  You know, and Canelo, I sparred and that was controlled. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5256.88s)]
*  But I sparred Cam Cam Newton once, you know, the football player. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5260.84s)]
*  Yeah, who's six foot five. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5264.88s)]
*  And he was in the gym and he wanted to work. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5266.4400000000005s)]
*  And I'm like, well, let's spar and we'll just, you know, spar light. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5268.56s)]
*  And he wasn't a boxer. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5271.96s)]
*  And I have, you know, basic defensive boxing skills. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5272.96s)]
*  But I'm like, well, just let's work him. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5276.68s)]
*  And he's like, OK. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5278.400000000001s)]
*  And we started, you know, kind of sparring a bit. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5279.52s)]
*  And he didn't really know what he was doing. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5282.0s)]
*  But he's a very, very physical specimen. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5283.48s)]
*  And I lightly kind of jabbed at his face and maybe hit the gloves. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5287.599999999999s)]
*  And he just went insane. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5292.48s)]
*  I started punching me across the ring. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5294.12s)]
*  And I'm just like flashes of white. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5298.08s)]
*  I lost all feeling in my hands. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5301.08s)]
*  And then I didn't I didn't spar any other athletes [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5304.919999999999s)]
*  until Steve Nash came into our gym, the basketball player. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5308.719999999999s)]
*  And he wasn't as big as Kevin. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5312.04s)]
*  And so I'm like, well, all right, I'll spar with Steve Nash. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5313.64s)]
*  And he doesn't know how to box. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5316.24s)]
*  So we'll just gentleman spar. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5317.2s)]
*  So we're sparring a bit. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5318.84s)]
*  And I hit him. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5320.52s)]
*  And I underestimate how fucking athletic he is. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5321.4800000000005s)]
*  He just fucking cracks me hard with a solid right. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5325.24s)]
*  And it's my hands go numb. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5329.56s)]
*  I see nothing. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5331.12s)]
*  And then I'm like, that's it. I'm done. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5332.72s)]
*  And then Saquon Barkley comes into our gym. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5335.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, do you know who Israel Barkley was? [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5339.64s)]
*  Pro fighter, his uncle had an incredible career as a pro fighter. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5342.24s)]
*  Is that Iran Barkley? [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5347.32s)]
*  I'm sorry. My bad. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5348.32s)]
*  Iran Barkley. Thank you. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5350.16s)]
*  Wow. That was a political slip. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5352.0s)]
*  Israel Barkley. Oh, shit. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5353.92s)]
*  Sorry, everybody. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5356.52s)]
*  Thank you, Joe. Iran Barkley. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5358.6s)]
*  Do you know why Iran Barkley is? Sure. OK, good. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5360.64s)]
*  So that was Saquon Barkley's uncle. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5363.16s)]
*  Right. Did you know that? No, I did not. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5365.4s)]
*  Yeah, that was his uncle. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5367.28s)]
*  So Saquon comes into our gym and I'm like, oh, I'm I'm going to spar. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5369.08s)]
*  And I'm like, no, I'm not. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5373.08s)]
*  I'm not going to fuck with this guy. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5374.48s)]
*  After Cam Newton and Steve Nash and Saquon Barkley is a fucking stud. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5376.2s)]
*  Right. Like this guy's like Mike Tyson, but bigger, just his body type. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5381.639999999999s)]
*  So I'm like, well, I'll hold Mitzvah. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5386.4s)]
*  I just want to see. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5387.88s)]
*  And that guy could fight like his uncle, Iran Barkley. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5389.2s)]
*  Legend. Legend. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5393.08s)]
*  Taught him and he started throwing punches and Saquon Barkley could move [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5395.24s)]
*  and counter and had balance and, you know, head movement. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5399.88s)]
*  I'm like, dude, if you had instead of playing football, gotten into this at [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5403.5199999999995s)]
*  at, you know, 12, 13. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5408.36s)]
*  I'm assuming that your brain stayed on. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5411.84s)]
*  You would have been one of the great heavyweights of all time. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5414.28s)]
*  He could say, Quan can box. Wow. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5417.08s)]
*  And so but I learned I thought about taking the fight in Mexico and I decided. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5420.28s)]
*  I'm not. Would you ever? Yeah. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5425.56s)]
*  Hell no. Right. Yeah. No, not now. I'm 57. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5427.24s)]
*  There's no way I'm fighting anybody now. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5430.32s)]
*  Dude, you're in shape. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5432.76s)]
*  I did agree to fight Wesley Snipes like 20 years ago. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5433.76s)]
*  Yeah. There was nothing. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5438.24s)]
*  Well, he you remember what happened with him with taxes? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5439.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, of course. We went to jail, right? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5442.72s)]
*  Yeah. So I think they were trying to figure out a way to make money [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5444.400000000001s)]
*  to try to pay the government off. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5447.8s)]
*  And the UFC, they contacted. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5449.2s)]
*  Well, this guy, Campbell McLaren, who was one of the original producers [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5454.360000000001s)]
*  of the first UFC before Zufa bought it. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5458.200000000001s)]
*  He he he knew me because I worked for him at the time. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5461.200000000001s)]
*  I was the post fight interviewer in 1997 and 1998. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5464.4800000000005s)]
*  And that's that was when I first started working for the UFC. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5468.0s)]
*  I remember I started again as a commentator in 2001. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5471.04s)]
*  So in 1997, when I knew him, he knew that I did martial arts. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5474.200000000001s)]
*  He knows obsessed with this. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5479.280000000001s)]
*  And then so he contacts me like I guess it was like 2004 [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5480.28s)]
*  or five or something like that somewhere around then. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5485.24s)]
*  And he says, this is going to sound crazy. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5487.639999999999s)]
*  But Wesley Snipes wants to have a UFC fight. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5490.759999999999s)]
*  And he wanted to fight Jean-Claude Van Damme. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5495.2s)]
*  And we didn't think that that would be compelling. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5497.679999999999s)]
*  And so we offered some other names. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5500.04s)]
*  And we said, what about Joe Rogan? [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5502.24s)]
*  And he said, yes. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5503.84s)]
*  And I said, well, what do you mean? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5505.599999999999s)]
*  Like, when are we talking about? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5507.28s)]
*  Like how? Because I've been training. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5508.5199999999995s)]
*  I was brown belt jujitsu and I'd been training kickboxing still. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5509.76s)]
*  I was regularly training. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5513.4400000000005s)]
*  And so I would have had to really ramp everything. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5515.0s)]
*  And he was kind of a martial arts guy. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5516.84s)]
*  He's a martial artist. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5519.04s)]
*  But I don't think he's ever had a fight. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5519.84s)]
*  And I don't think he has any ground game. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5521.6s)]
*  And that's a giant problem. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5524.24s)]
*  No. And you really got in the hold of. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5525.8s)]
*  But also I was a national. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5527.280000000001s)]
*  I competed nationally in Taekwondo for five, six years, traveled around the country. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5528.96s)]
*  Like, and I had three kickboxing fights. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5534.68s)]
*  I was a good stand up fighter. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5536.68s)]
*  And I can kick very hard. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5538.4s)]
*  I'm very good. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5540.28s)]
*  And even then, I was even better because I was in my 30s. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5541.48s)]
*  So what happened? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5544.16s)]
*  He didn't want to do it. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5545.28s)]
*  He felt like as time went on. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5546.599999999999s)]
*  You just said you would have killed him. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5547.96s)]
*  As time went on, I think he kind of understood that it was a bad idea. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5549.88s)]
*  I think initially he thought he may. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5553.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, who knows? It could have been fucking chemically fueled. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5555.48s)]
*  These these conversations with the desire to have it was chemically [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5558.599999999999s)]
*  fooled and then he sobered up. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5561.76s)]
*  But I trained every day. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5563.599999999999s)]
*  I trained for six months. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5565.36s)]
*  You would have annihilated. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5566.5199999999995s)]
*  I was kickboxing with Rob Kamen in the morning and I was doing jujitsu. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5567.56s)]
*  And I was fucking prepping for the Wesley. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5570.56s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5573.76s)]
*  Fighters just didn't. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5574.160000000001s)]
*  We were in negotiation. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5574.88s)]
*  So the first negotiation was 50-50. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5576.0s)]
*  They were going to split a 50-50 this and that. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5578.240000000001s)]
*  Ba ba ba. And I said, OK, great. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5579.88s)]
*  And then a couple of weeks went by. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5581.400000000001s)]
*  I had lawyers involved, the whole thing. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5584.080000000001s)]
*  And then it was like Wesley wants 60-40. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5585.4800000000005s)]
*  And this time I'd already invested so much time training. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5590.4800000000005s)]
*  I go, OK, I just give it to him. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5592.84s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to fuck this guy up. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5594.84s)]
*  I go, just give it to him. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5596.280000000001s)]
*  Just give it to him. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5597.56s)]
*  And then it got to a point where just give me half a million dollars. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5598.6s)]
*  I don't care what you give Wesley. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5601.84s)]
*  I go, give me half a million dollars. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5603.72s)]
*  And we agreed on that. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5605.4400000000005s)]
*  I said, I don't care what you give him. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5606.64s)]
*  Just give it to him. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5607.76s)]
*  I'm going to I'm going to fucking strangle this guy. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5608.400000000001s)]
*  I'm going to get a hold of him. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5611.52s)]
*  And there's not going to be a goddamn thing he can do about it. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5612.72s)]
*  I was convinced. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5615.4400000000005s)]
*  And I was like, so was Wesley. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5616.6s)]
*  It was so but it was so engrossing. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5618.52s)]
*  Like it took up all my energy and my time. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5621.72s)]
*  Right. Like my mind shifted [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5624.52s)]
*  into like what it was when I was younger and I was fighting. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5627.28s)]
*  It was wild. It was weird. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5630.04s)]
*  Like I became like a different person for like like almost a year. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5631.639999999999s)]
*  So like when you hear the name Wesley Snipes now, I have no animosity. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5634.48s)]
*  There's not like a little part of your brain that still flips. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5638.36s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5641.16s)]
*  I think he did a smart thing. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5643.92s)]
*  I think he did a smart thing by not doing it. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5645.96s)]
*  It's just so interesting. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5648.08s)]
*  And and the idea that you got to experience [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5649.5599999999995s)]
*  a version of what it feels like to prepare to fight someone. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5654.6s)]
*  Yeah. People just don't get it. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5657.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. Well, I had fought a bunch of times, you know, and when I was younger. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5659.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, it had been more than 10 years since my last fight. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5663.280000000001s)]
*  But I knew what it was like. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5666.64s)]
*  I knew the experience. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5668.68s)]
*  I knew what training and preparing was like. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5670.08s)]
*  And I also knew that like I was a like a legitimate brown belt in jujitsu. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5673.400000000001s)]
*  I had been training him for a while. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5677.64s)]
*  But it was like I think he had had this idea that he was going to be able [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5679.72s)]
*  to hit me when I was trying to take him down. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5683.28s)]
*  I was like, do you know fucking happily stand up? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5684.88s)]
*  Do you think the Zuckerberg Musk was ever real? [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5687.4s)]
*  Was it ever even slightly real? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5692.96s)]
*  I don't know that that to me is the most. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5695.32s)]
*  Could you ask him, please? Zuckerberg is legit. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5697.44s)]
*  He trains hard. He trains with legit guys. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5700.08s)]
*  He trains all the time. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5702.639999999999s)]
*  He's very smart and very obsessed by it. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5703.84s)]
*  And he's like legitimately training. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5706.0s)]
*  He's significantly smaller than Elon. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5708.0s)]
*  Elon's a big guy. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5710.16s)]
*  But that only goes so far, especially if you don't have any endurance. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5712.36s)]
*  But does Elon, what do you think Elon's fighting skill strategy would be like? [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5715.839999999999s)]
*  But he took karate when he was younger. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5720.36s)]
*  So would he come karateing? [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5721.96s)]
*  I don't know. I don't think it was ever going to happen. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5723.48s)]
*  I mean, I was entertaining it because I think it would be fun if it did happen. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5726.16s)]
*  And Elon said he would do it. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5729.759999999999s)]
*  And Zuckerberg said he would do it. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5730.839999999999s)]
*  But like, how can I don't know how the guy tweets as much as he does. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5731.88s)]
*  How the fuck could you train for a fight? [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5736.08s)]
*  I mean, how do you how do you run SpaceX and Tesla? [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5737.759999999999s)]
*  And the Department of Government Efficiency and Starlink? [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5742.16s)]
*  So he's your friend. You know him better than we do. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5745.04s)]
*  How the fuck does he do it? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5747.4s)]
*  How he does it. And I'm his friend. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5748.72s)]
*  I don't know how he does it. I don't understand it. He's he's [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5750.12s)]
*  I've never seen anybody who knows how to manage time better than that guy. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5754.16s)]
*  Yeah. But and he's also has like 100 kids like I don't fucking. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5758.5199999999995s)]
*  I just different type of human. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5762.48s)]
*  I just love the idea of people that don't ever fight. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5764.5199999999995s)]
*  Having to suddenly have a fight. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5769.16s)]
*  Right. Just like like, you know, because people have never fought. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5772.04s)]
*  But suddenly get them. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5775.72s)]
*  And yeah. OK, here's another secret. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5777.280000000001s)]
*  Don't like when I do scroll, I look for street [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5779.320000000001s)]
*  fights with people who don't know how to fight [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5783.280000000001s)]
*  or or drunk people fighting as well. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5786.280000000001s)]
*  You too. But like like, you know, OK, Elon and Zucker [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5788.64s)]
*  Mark, you know, are going to fight. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5793.96s)]
*  OK, let's say it's going to really happen. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5795.280000000001s)]
*  We both train, but they're not fighters. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5797.64s)]
*  So however much they train, they're still running their other businesses. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5799.84s)]
*  Now the fight starts. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5802.68s)]
*  And for about 20 seconds, they're going to have some tactics [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5804.28s)]
*  that their trainers have been. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5807.56s)]
*  And then it's all going to go out the fucking window. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5808.92s)]
*  We'll go out the window with Zuckerberg. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5811.84s)]
*  Zuckerberg is a real martial artist. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5814.0s)]
*  Has he ever really fought? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5815.360000000001s)]
*  Yes, he's have Jiu Jitsu matches. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5816.64s)]
*  He hasn't fought a kickboxing match, but he does a lot of sparring. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5818.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. He could do a two minute or three minute. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5821.96s)]
*  100 percent. No doubt. Yeah, no doubt. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5824.28s)]
*  And also, he's very disciplined. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5826.68s)]
*  And stay true to his. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5828.36s)]
*  Yeah. What style of fighting? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5829.48s)]
*  Well, he trains in Jiu Jitsu, but he also trains in mixed martial arts. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5831.5599999999995s)]
*  So he does Muay Thai. He does everything. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5835.4s)]
*  He's really obsessed with it. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5837.36s)]
*  And he has been for years. OK, so he's a legitimate martial artist. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5838.92s)]
*  Elon's going to come out and Elon's running SpaceX and he's got to dodge. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5842.679999999999s)]
*  And now he's going to take some time and focus on the fight. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5847.16s)]
*  It's not going to do it. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5849.5599999999995s)]
*  No, you don't have it. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5850.92s)]
*  There's no way he has the time. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5852.32s)]
*  But if you want to really prepare properly, you train twice a day [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5854.0s)]
*  and you have to have recovery in between. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5857.12s)]
*  So you have to get massages. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5858.76s)]
*  You have to do red light therapy. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5860.12s)]
*  Do you have to do everything, especially if you're at his age [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5861.68s)]
*  and you have to take hormones, you have to be on the ball. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5864.5199999999995s)]
*  You have to take peptides. You have to. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5866.84s)]
*  You have to really watch your nutrition. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5868.72s)]
*  You have to really make sure you get enough sleep. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5870.68s)]
*  All those things are out the window. He's not doing any of those things. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5872.68s)]
*  He doesn't have the time to do any of those things. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5875.08s)]
*  No, it would have to be like a demonstration [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5876.5199999999995s)]
*  where they agree to how it's going to go. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5879.5199999999995s)]
*  Even then, there's no way he could be in condition for it. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5881.28s)]
*  Yeah, there's no way. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5883.92s)]
*  And so he did train with some of my friends. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5885.32s)]
*  He trained with Lex Lex Friedman. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5887.0s)]
*  I think he trained with George St. Pierre as well. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5889.28s)]
*  So I think he realized early on his cardio wasn't going to get him there. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5891.36s)]
*  His cardio is non-existent. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5895.92s)]
*  What is what is harder on cardio than boxing slash UFC? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5897.36s)]
*  Do you think like I always say boxing? [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5902.5199999999995s)]
*  People don't understand how exhausting 40 seconds of sparring is like. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5904.88s)]
*  And I'm never fought UFC. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5909.96s)]
*  I've always felt that boxing, for some reason, is actually harder on the on the cardio. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5912.16s)]
*  I'm sure I'm wrong. I'm sure. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5918.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. Wrestling is the hardest. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5919.76s)]
*  OK, but but but the what what else compares [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5921.8s)]
*  in terms of cardio and physical demanding to wrestling, UFC, boxing? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5926.4400000000005s)]
*  What maybe ultra running, maybe really crazy things where guys have to run like 300 miles. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5932.36s)]
*  But they don't have the anaerobic kind of exhaustion and the soccer. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5937.36s)]
*  Soccer takes incredible conditioning, incredible conditioning. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5940.92s)]
*  Those guys are unbelievably fit. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5943.88s)]
*  Have you ever followed Ozzie Rolls football? Yes. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5945.88s)]
*  So, you know, I'm doing my next films about a football game [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5949.56s)]
*  that some Marines played in World War Two, and we're filming it in Australia. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5954.76s)]
*  It's called the Mosquito Ball. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5958.52s)]
*  And in the middle of a true story about this football game [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5959.64s)]
*  that was played on Guadalcanal before the Battle of Okinawa. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5962.68s)]
*  But these Marines all played it. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5966.12s)]
*  These Marines were good college football stars. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5968.16s)]
*  And then they all died in the Battle of Okinawa. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5970.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's an intense story. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5972.48s)]
*  But we need to film this tackle football game. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5975.04s)]
*  There was supposed to be a touch game and the Marines ended up playing tackle. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5978.76s)]
*  And legend has it that it was the most violent football game ever played. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5982.5199999999995s)]
*  And so we got to film a tackle football game [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5986.5199999999995s)]
*  in Australia, which is we're going to make the film. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5990.08s)]
*  And like stuntmen are tough, but like playing tackle football, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5992.599999999999s)]
*  you know, is a fucking painful thing to do. Right. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=5997.36s)]
*  Imagine, you know, even like turkey bowl touch football games on Thanksgiving. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6000.96s)]
*  Like people are in the hospital. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6005.16s)]
*  So I was just in Australia and I had the idea that, well, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6007.08s)]
*  like Ozzie Rolls football, it's perfect. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6010.84s)]
*  We'll just take a bunch of these guys and teach them how to play tackle football. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6013.2s)]
*  And they'll really do it. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6017.76s)]
*  So I just went to an Ozzie Rolls football practice in [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6019.68s)]
*  in Brisbane, Australia. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6023.92s)]
*  And those fucking dudes are tough. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6028.4s)]
*  They are tough. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6031.76s)]
*  If you ever just watch like the highlight reels of Ozzie, I mean, the notepads [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6033.48s)]
*  full smash. And I put that. Yeah, here it is. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6038.4s)]
*  I mean, yeah, these are the guys we're going to use. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6043.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. These fucking collisions. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6046.6s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. I think these are the toughest athletes. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6049.5599999999995s)]
*  I think this is how they should play regular football. I do, too. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6053.5199999999995s)]
*  I feel I feel like the pads are bullshit. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6056.68s)]
*  But there's only way the only way you can pay American style football is with pads [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6059.12s)]
*  because like the collisions that these guys have, like your career, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6063.5199999999995s)]
*  because you look at this guy, look at how cold is done stiff. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6066.48s)]
*  Look at this. Look at the hitting is just fucking nuts. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6070.48s)]
*  And I'm sure a lot of head to head collisions, too. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6076.32s)]
*  So I went to this practice of one of these teams just got back [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6078.44s)]
*  and they were and I brought in American football. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6082.36s)]
*  And I'm like, do you guys have any idea? [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6085.719999999999s)]
*  And they're like, zero. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6087.92s)]
*  I'm like, come on, you you sort of have to know something. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6089.719999999999s)]
*  And they're like, zero. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6093.88s)]
*  So I really I get they just know nothing. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6095.599999999999s)]
*  Like how much cricket do you know? Zero. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6097.88s)]
*  OK, if you if I had a gun to your head and said one rule of cricket, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6100.5199999999995s)]
*  could you do it? No. Could you do it? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6104.599999999999s)]
*  No, you could. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6107.36s)]
*  Like cricket, do you understand? [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6108.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, it's got to stay in. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6110.68s)]
*  I think I've seen him try to throw back in. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6111.52s)]
*  Stay in the water. The ball has to stay in the water. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6113.320000000001s)]
*  The pitch. They go out the pitch. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6116.08s)]
*  We don't know shit. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6117.6s)]
*  No. Do you understand how fucking popular cricket is? Gigantic. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6118.8s)]
*  Like bigger than football. Huge. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6121.6s)]
*  Go to India or Sri Lanka. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6123.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, like these people go nuts. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6124.96s)]
*  So in Australia, they have hundred thousand people [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6127.12s)]
*  stadiums for Ozzie Willis football. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6130.88s)]
*  So I go and I'm like, you know, I'm meeting these guys [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6133.84s)]
*  and these guys, I think, are big stars. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6137.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know them. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6139.32s)]
*  But, you know, this is a major Ozzie Willis football team. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6140.16s)]
*  And I got the football and they don't. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6142.759999999999s)]
*  So I line them up 11 against 11. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6144.16s)]
*  And I'm teeth in there. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6146.96s)]
*  They're really kind of starting to get into it. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6148.16s)]
*  And they're lined up center guards tackles and court. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6150.48s)]
*  And I'm like, all right. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6153.599999999999s)]
*  So what do you think? They're like, yeah, we don't like it. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6155.12s)]
*  I go, let me let me help. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6156.799999999999s)]
*  Tell me what this does for you. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6158.08s)]
*  All right. You're the center. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6159.44s)]
*  And if you were doing this in American football, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6160.88s)]
*  you'd be making six to seven million dollars a year. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6163.08s)]
*  You're the tackle on blindside. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6165.96s)]
*  You're making 40 million dollars a year protecting Patrick Mahomes. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6167.68s)]
*  OK, you're Patrick Mahomes. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6171.4800000000005s)]
*  And I'm telling them how much money they would make [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6173.16s)]
*  because you guys make no money. Right. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6175.8s)]
*  There's no money in it, which is crazy, crazy. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6178.12s)]
*  And then they have, you know, tall poppy syndrome. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6181.0s)]
*  Have you heard of this? [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6184.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. Like, yes, there's no ego like these guys. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6185.4800000000005s)]
*  They're huge. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6189.240000000001s)]
*  You know, they're members of these super successful teams, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6190.4800000000005s)]
*  but they don't have the ego of American athletes. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6193.4800000000005s)]
*  And they don't get the attention. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6196.88s)]
*  And it's tall poppy syndrome. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6198.72s)]
*  They're culturally, you know, conditioned to not brag [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6200.52s)]
*  and to boast and to be humble. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6205.12s)]
*  And and I don't know. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6207.84s)]
*  I'm I they like to see people get knocked down and get too big. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6209.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. That's tall poppy. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6212.88s)]
*  They cut the tall poppy gets its head cut off. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6214.96s)]
*  So they stay humble, which I kind of thought was kind of cool. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6217.200000000001s)]
*  You know, just realizing that I was hanging out with like the captain of [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6221.4400000000005s)]
*  an Ozzy rules team and I had dinner with the captain of the [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6226.72s)]
*  Oh, the New Zealand, the All Blacks, the rugby team. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6230.88s)]
*  And this guy, this was a little while ago, a couple of years ago. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6235.84s)]
*  This guy in America, I mean, you know, the All Blacks, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6241.400000000001s)]
*  like the most popular rugby team and the most humble dude ever. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6243.72s)]
*  And you go to a restaurant and nobody bothers him. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6247.52s)]
*  He, you know, no security, no nothing. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6249.8s)]
*  We don't that would never exist here. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6253.0s)]
*  But seeing how hard these dudes hit and trained [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6256.84s)]
*  made me think, well, maybe they're working at the level of athleticism [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6261.0s)]
*  that fighters are working at. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6265.24s)]
*  I mean, that's a hard fucking sport. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6267.04s)]
*  It seems like it, especially if you watch that video. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6268.96s)]
*  Like, that's that's unbelievably cruel. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6271.44s)]
*  The difference between fighting and anything else is [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6273.68s)]
*  that there's no one there to assist you. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6276.88s)]
*  There's no other teammates. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6278.52s)]
*  There's no rules. There's no timeouts. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6279.8s)]
*  You know, you have round breaks, but fighting is very individual. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6281.96s)]
*  And if you didn't prepare properly and your opponent did, you're fucked. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6286.04s)]
*  If he's better than you and he's more skilled and he's got better genetics [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6289.68s)]
*  and better training and he comes from a better background and he's more [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6293.2s)]
*  he's more technical, you're fucked. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6297.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, it's it's it's a crazy sport where you're literally [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6299.68s)]
*  putting your health on the line. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6302.8s)]
*  Let me ask you this question. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6304.32s)]
*  And this this is something I don't talk about. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6305.84s)]
*  But it's another secret theory that I have. OK. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6308.4s)]
*  Just between you and me, I feel like and I've seen a lot of boxers training [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6311.36s)]
*  and I've seen a lot of great trainers. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6317.08s)]
*  Eddie and Chepo are great trainers. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6321.0s)]
*  Abel Sanchez is a great trainer. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6324.0s)]
*  Pedro Nema from my gym. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6325.68s)]
*  Lots of great trainers out there. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6327.28s)]
*  And I've watched entire camps where trainers like if I'm your trainer, [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6329.2s)]
*  I figure out, OK, this is our opponent. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6334.48s)]
*  These these are going to be our tactics. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6337.5199999999995s)]
*  We're going to do a lot of jabbing with overhead rights. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6339.28s)]
*  And we're going to take our head offline consistently. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6341.92s)]
*  We're going to counter this way. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6344.48s)]
*  We're going to. And every and I really watched this [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6346.32s)]
*  and paid a lot of attention to it. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6349.92s)]
*  And this is I'm not in any way shitting on trainers, [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6351.32s)]
*  but I'm kind of making your point about how alone fighters are. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6354.88s)]
*  I see all this training and I watch it and I understand the strategies [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6359.08s)]
*  and the tactics. And the second the fight starts, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6363.2s)]
*  none of it has any relationship to how the fight goes down. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6366.28s)]
*  It all the strategy is rarely employed. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6370.2s)]
*  And it becomes this moment where a fighter has to adjust [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6373.88s)]
*  and adapt and improvise incredibly. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6378.24s)]
*  And yeah, the conditioning matters a lot. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6381.24s)]
*  But I often think that, like, the training doesn't do shit. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6384.56s)]
*  The trainers are they can help you get your head right [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6388.68s)]
*  and get yourself in a warrior's mindset. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6392.64s)]
*  And I do respect that. But tactics. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6394.52s)]
*  Sometimes I think that they're like. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6398.120000000001s)]
*  Am I wrong? Yeah. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6401.76s)]
*  OK, yeah, definitely wrong. All right. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6403.6s)]
*  At the highest level, it's the most important thing. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6405.56s)]
*  OK, but do not at the highest level, like at a Terrence [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6407.64s)]
*  Crawford level, level tactics are everything. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6411.52s)]
*  But he just does it. Yeah, he does does it. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6413.88s)]
*  But it's also because he spent so much time working on the fundamentals [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6416.280000000001s)]
*  and the technique and the movements and counters and positioning. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6420.84s)]
*  And he understands boxing so comprehensively. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6424.8s)]
*  He knows where the punches are coming from. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6428.24s)]
*  He knows where he's going to be vulnerable to get hit. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6430.56s)]
*  He knows when he's not. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6434.0s)]
*  He knows when he has to take a risk and to give one, he has to take one. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6435.16s)]
*  But how much of that like his his trainer, Bohem, Bohem. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6439.12s)]
*  I might be saying I know him. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6444.08s)]
*  I know his trainer, just like Eddie and Chepo. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6445.56s)]
*  And they've gotten who's got to have Canelo. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6449.28s)]
*  They have lots of other fighters. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6452.28s)]
*  But like Eddie and Chepo have never had another Canelo Alvarez [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6455.32s)]
*  and including all of his brothers. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6458.84s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, how much of it is just God given talent [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6461.12s)]
*  like Terrence Crawford has that's then trained by trainers [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6465.04s)]
*  versus how much credit does a trainer get? [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6469.679999999999s)]
*  Training gets some credit, but a trainer with a bad fighter [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6472.08s)]
*  is never going to create a world champion. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6475.2s)]
*  Like you have to be an extraordinary individual [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6477.88s)]
*  to be a championship level fighter, no doubt. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6480.56s)]
*  And then there are some championship level fighters that have [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6482.88s)]
*  they have emerged from gyms that don't have any championship, [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6487.2s)]
*  like Marvin Hager, one of the greatest of all time. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6489.88s)]
*  He came out of the Petronelli brothers gym. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6492.28s)]
*  They weren't known for having like a giant stable of multiple world champions. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6494.400000000001s)]
*  Who is the who are the top who, in your opinion, the best UFC trainers? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6499.96s)]
*  Well, there's quite a few. There's quite a few. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6505.0s)]
*  There's some really elite trainers out there. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6507.4s)]
*  And I don't want to miss anybody. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6509.719999999999s)]
*  For us, the hobby is probably my favorite. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6511.639999999999s)]
*  He's because he's very, very intelligent and very analytical. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6514.32s)]
*  And he does a fantastic job also of breaking down fights [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6519.719999999999s)]
*  both before the fight and after the fight and telling you like what tactics [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6523.44s)]
*  didn't work and why they didn't work and what went wrong in the fight [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6528.08s)]
*  and what was very effective. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6531.28s)]
*  He's just a brilliant human being and also just [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6532.839999999999s)]
*  so intelligent about the way he makes his fighters prepare. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6536.6s)]
*  And he trained George St. Pierre, who's one of the greatest, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6541.280000000001s)]
*  if not the greatest of all time. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6544.4400000000005s)]
*  So there's him. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6546.0s)]
*  There's Greg Jackson and Mike Winkle, John from Jackson Winkle, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6549.04s)]
*  John and Albuquerque, which is phenomenal gym. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6553.360000000001s)]
*  That's where John Jones came from. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6556.360000000001s)]
*  Multiple world champions have come from that gym. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6558.320000000001s)]
*  Those guys are phenomenal. John Crouch in Arizona. He's phenomenal. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6561.240000000001s)]
*  There's just so many fucking like top of the food chain guys. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6565.719999999999s)]
*  And how much how much of that skill is and if it's it's all equal, I get it. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6570.36s)]
*  But how much of that skill that makes a great UFC trainer is, OK, [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6576.44s)]
*  if I'm your trainer and I'm getting you ready for a fight, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6581.2s)]
*  I'm going to study your opponent. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6583.96s)]
*  I'm going to stay your opponent's strengths, his weaknesses, his tendencies, [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6585.28s)]
*  his tells, and I'm going to train you in relationship to that and and be right. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6588.599999999999s)]
*  Right. So I you can anticipate where there's going to be an opportunity and take it. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6594.799999999999s)]
*  How much of it is that and how effective is that like versus how much of it is, Joe? [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6600.36s)]
*  I got to keep you fucking ready for anything. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6605.679999999999s)]
*  I got to keep you in shape. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6608.0s)]
*  I got to keep you mentally like good. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6609.5599999999995s)]
*  I got to remove distractions. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6613.28s)]
*  And I got to be like your father, your uncle, your brother [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6615.28s)]
*  and everything else in between. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6619.959999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, I think there's both. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6621.759999999999s)]
*  But I think for some fighters, every fighter is a different approach. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6623.64s)]
*  John Jones is famous for studying tape and devising game plans [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6627.08s)]
*  and strategies that are based on what he sees about his opponent's tendencies. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6632.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And that's how he caught Daniel Cormier with that left high kick. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6636.4400000000005s)]
*  Like he he knew Daniel dips to the right. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6639.8s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, and Daniel even called it out before that. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6642.92s)]
*  You think you're going to hit me with that head kick? [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6647.12s)]
*  And he actually did hit him with it in the fight because Daniel had a tendency. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6648.56s)]
*  And John exploited that tendency. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6652.719999999999s)]
*  And he does that with everybody. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6654.48s)]
*  He's famous for not just doing that, [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6656.0s)]
*  but also not taking fights on last minute notice. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6659.639999999999s)]
*  Like he's had some opponents fall out and the UFC offers him [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6662.879999999999s)]
*  an alternative opponent in a short period of time. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6666.599999999999s)]
*  And he says, no, I didn't train for that fighter. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6669.719999999999s)]
*  He goes, I'm the greatest of all time for a reason. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6672.32s)]
*  And that reason is I'm fully prepared for every fight. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6674.879999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to take a fight against someone who I'm not fully prepared. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6678.44s)]
*  And has he had the same coach his entire career? Yes. Yes. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6681.4s)]
*  So that's a real Jackson Winklejohn. He's been with them forever. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6684.839999999999s)]
*  And that's an incredible pairing. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6687.679999999999s)]
*  Well, it's incredible. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6689.879999999999s)]
*  Jackson, in particular, is fantastic at devising strategies to deal with opponents. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6690.759999999999s)]
*  And, you know, he trained Holly Holm when she knocked out Ronda Rousey. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6695.5599999999995s)]
*  No, I was there. They are. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6698.5199999999995s)]
*  You were in Australia for that? That was in Australia. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6700.16s)]
*  No, I wasn't there. I watched it. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6702.5199999999995s)]
*  I was. I felt like I was there because I watched it. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6704.4s)]
*  Yeah. And it was shocking. That was crazy. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6706.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. It was a crazy fight. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6708.679999999999s)]
*  But they trained her. Yes. Yeah. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6709.84s)]
*  Shocked, right? Oh, it was incredible. Yeah. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6712.76s)]
*  But Holly was good, man. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6715.12s)]
*  She's a multiple time world champion in boxing and in kickboxing. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6716.400000000001s)]
*  She was very, very legit striker. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6719.88s)]
*  Oh, you were surprised. Yeah, it was shocking. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6722.0s)]
*  But it was also like Holly was good. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6724.76s)]
*  She was really fucking good. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6726.6s)]
*  And when she landed that head kick. Yeah. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6728.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. I remember Ronda's face, just the shock in her face. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6730.0s)]
*  And yeah. And she just was. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6733.64s)]
*  Yeah, that was I literally felt like I was there because [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6736.2s)]
*  so I was a piercing moment. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6739.0s)]
*  But they knew that Ronda had a very specific entry that she used [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6741.12s)]
*  to try to take people down. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6744.76s)]
*  And they avoided that every single time. Kept her out. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6746.16s)]
*  They they circled away. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6748.8s)]
*  They fought off Ronda's takedown attempts and kept the fight standing. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6750.72s)]
*  And that flustered her. Yeah. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6754.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, it just it was just more effective. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6755.8s)]
*  And so it really depends on the athlete. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6757.64s)]
*  Like I said, if you get a person that falls apart in the heat of the moment [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6761.4400000000005s)]
*  and just throws it all out the window and starts brawling. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6764.8s)]
*  Yeah. Well, then your training has kind of gone to waste. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6767.0s)]
*  And then they're relying on instincts and hopefully skill. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6769.04s)]
*  But if you have a really good fighter and a really good trainer, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6772.52s)]
*  then you get a Mike Tyson. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6776.44s)]
*  What was her trainer Edmund or Ronda's trainer? [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6777.6s)]
*  I can't remember his name. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6782.96s)]
*  But I wonder whether he underprepared her for that. Right. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6787.84s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, she was very stretched in when that was going on [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6791.8s)]
*  because she was doing movies and she was a superstar [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6796.48s)]
*  and she was like constantly being courted. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6799.28s)]
*  But, you know, you know, she did a movie for me. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6801.16s)]
*  I'm part of that problem. Oh, really? What was that? [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6804.04s)]
*  It was mile 22, but she had kind of retired by then. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6805.919999999999s)]
*  This was after her. This is after the fight. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6809.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think that the distractions when you're a superstar are huge. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6812.4s)]
*  And if you give in to all those distractions, you say yes to everything. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6816.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And you have agents that want you to be and you think like, [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6819.919999999999s)]
*  you're so confident you could do anything anyway. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6822.639999999999s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. I'll beat everybody. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6825.08s)]
*  And that's how every champion feels. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6826.96s)]
*  Sometimes I think about like what I've seen with with coaches. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6828.56s)]
*  And and, you know, I I do appreciate a coach. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6832.4400000000005s)]
*  And I've just seen different success stories in different ways [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6836.4400000000005s)]
*  that coaches have really impacted fighters. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6840.08s)]
*  But I think about like, why don't life coaches work better? [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6842.92s)]
*  And like, like, I wouldn't mind having a coach that would be like, Pete, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6847.0s)]
*  here's our enemy, here's our opponents. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6852.12s)]
*  And like I actually had a therapist for a while who actually for [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6854.48s)]
*  when I first started seeing him, his name's Barry. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6857.719999999999s)]
*  And he's a great guy. And I love him. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6860.04s)]
*  And he's but, you know, so much of my relationship with him was [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6862.5199999999995s)]
*  unpacking my shit, you know, my parents and my trauma and my fears and all this stuff. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6866.2s)]
*  And and for years, Barry would, you know, talk to me about my dreams [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6872.5199999999995s)]
*  and all this stuff and and like the dreams that I had that night, not my goals. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6876.96s)]
*  And then I started to realize, well, OK, I feel like I've talked about [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6881.5599999999995s)]
*  my mom and my grandma, my grandparents and every fucking thing, [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6884.36s)]
*  the bad that's ever happened to me. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6888.32s)]
*  And and like Barry, what if we start talking strategy? [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6889.84s)]
*  Like, could you coach me? [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6893.16s)]
*  And he started coaching me a bit. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6895.04s)]
*  And I found that, like with my business decisions, my creativity decisions, [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6897.24s)]
*  like, like, you're so disciplined, you know, like, I don't know. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6902.679999999999s)]
*  Do you ever think like, why don't life coaches work better? [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6907.719999999999s)]
*  And if you had someone like [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6911.84s)]
*  John Jones coach in your life every fucking day, would would it be better? [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6915.0s)]
*  I think for a lot of people, yes. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6922.64s)]
*  Yeah, if you could find someone who could devise a strategy [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6925.04s)]
*  that you could follow and you could help because it's a collaboration, [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6928.08s)]
*  you know, you could collaborate with this person and go. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6931.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's definitely value in that. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6934.56s)]
*  But you could also be your own coach. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6936.96s)]
*  Yeah, but you can. So many people can't write like, don't people ask you [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6939.48s)]
*  or I don't know, they ask me for advice and how do you do it? [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6944.2s)]
*  And I'm like, well, you know, you've got to go to bed. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6948.16s)]
*  You've got to get up early. You've got to have self motivation. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6950.36s)]
*  You have to not make stupid mistakes. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6953.08s)]
*  And you know, sometimes what you don't do that helps more than what you do. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6956.08s)]
*  And I I'm aware of people struggling to figure out [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6960.799999999999s)]
*  like more than ever, especially with, you know, all this perceived success [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6966.32s)]
*  through social media and the glorification of billionaires and all this stuff. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6970.6s)]
*  Everyone's like, I'm not happy where I am and I want and I and I'm like, well, [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6974.6s)]
*  you know, are you following these basic rules? [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6978.92s)]
*  Like the basic rules that I believe you follow, you, Joe, follow. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6981.6s)]
*  And people seem to have so much trouble. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6985.72s)]
*  Getting on a program. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6989.24s)]
*  Well, you got to pay attention to the people that are successful. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6990.8s)]
*  Like, what are they doing? [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6993.84s)]
*  And without doubt, [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6995.32s)]
*  everyone who is really successful and has longevity has discipline. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=6998.48s)]
*  And discipline is maybe number one. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7003.759999999999s)]
*  Discipline is showing up with a desire to improve and work hard every day. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7006.5599999999995s)]
*  What do you think the source of your discipline is? [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7012.04s)]
*  Martial arts for sure. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7014.84s)]
*  100 percent. Learning when I was young, that focus and and [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7016.36s)]
*  and drive and attention to detail and an obsession [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7020.64s)]
*  leads you to get excellent at something. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7025.64s)]
*  And there's no ifs, ands or buts about it. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7027.56s)]
*  That the more time I put in, the more I trained, the better I got. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7029.72s)]
*  The more I was really locked in and focused, the better I performed. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7032.8s)]
*  And I learned that at a young age. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7036.200000000001s)]
*  I learned that as a kid. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7037.96s)]
*  And so I developed discipline when I was very young. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7039.8s)]
*  But so thousands of young people. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7042.400000000001s)]
*  What age did you start martial arts? [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7045.92s)]
*  I started fighting when I was 15. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7047.64s)]
*  OK, but you started fighting. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7048.8s)]
*  I started training when I was like 14. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7050.639999999999s)]
*  OK, but I took my first karate class. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7052.719999999999s)]
*  That's actually older than I would have thought. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7054.5599999999995s)]
*  But like so so many, you know, thousands of kids [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7056.799999999999s)]
*  take boxing classes or your lessons or mixed martial arts or whatever. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7060.4s)]
*  And they don't find the level of discipline that you were able to find. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7066.36s)]
*  Right. Yeah, it's not for everybody. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7071.04s)]
*  So but what made you able what made you like? [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7072.36s)]
*  Was it your parents? [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7075.599999999999s)]
*  Was it insecurity? [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7077.04s)]
*  Yeah, someone that gave you shit when you were eight [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7078.72s)]
*  that made you like, fuck it, I'm going to learn this shit [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7081.84s)]
*  and I'm going to master it. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7084.240000000001s)]
*  Well, when I first started doing it, I just wanted to figure out how to fight. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7085.4800000000005s)]
*  And I wanted and I was very lucky that I found a gym [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7090.360000000001s)]
*  that was filled with incredible fighters. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7093.12s)]
*  They were very high level. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7095.68s)]
*  One of the guys, my friend John Lee was a national champion [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7097.64s)]
*  and he was like a mentor to me. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7100.96s)]
*  And, you know, I was a white belt and he was a black belt [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7103.400000000001s)]
*  and competing in the World Cup at the time. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7106.12s)]
*  That's when I met him. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7108.4s)]
*  And, you know, he just took a liking to me and helped me out a lot. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7109.839999999999s)]
*  So white belts, you're a complete beginner. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7112.679999999999s)]
*  But I got a black belt in two years. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7115.96s)]
*  I was obsessed. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7117.92s)]
*  I trained every day of the week. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7119.679999999999s)]
*  I had a key to the gym and I could work out any time I wanted [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7120.759999999999s)]
*  because my instructor at some point in time realized that I had potential [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7124.32s)]
*  and made a deal with me and offered me I could teach classes. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7128.879999999999s)]
*  And if I taught classes and I taught private lessons, like teaching beginners, [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7133.48s)]
*  like when they first come in, you have to take a certain amount of beginner classes, [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7136.92s)]
*  private lessons before you're allowed to enter into the group class. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7140.08s)]
*  So I would teach people from the very beginning. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7143.6s)]
*  And so because of that, I was able to be at the gym all day long. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7145.6s)]
*  And whenever I wanted to be there, I could be there. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7151.04s)]
*  And I also from teaching really broke down technique, [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7153.16s)]
*  which is the most important thing to like if you have bad technique, [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7158.28s)]
*  even if you're like a good fighter, you have flaws in your. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7161.76s)]
*  You can get pretty far with bad technique if you're just eventually you get [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7165.04s)]
*  you get caught. It's just not you're not going to be the best. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7168.72s)]
*  The best have excellent technique, like without doubt, [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7171.32s)]
*  especially when it comes to martial arts. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7174.4s)]
*  It's but kicking and jujitsu like it's technique is everything [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7176.44s)]
*  and technique and drive and training and focus. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7180.72s)]
*  And I realized early on, like I thought I was a loser. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7183.92s)]
*  And then until I started doing martial arts and getting really good at martial arts, [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7186.56s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I'm not a loser. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7189.44s)]
*  Like, I'm really good at this. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7190.56s)]
*  Like I have a propensity to it. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7192.2s)]
*  I have a genetic propensity. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7194.72s)]
*  I have like very good. I'm fast. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7197.320000000001s)]
*  I hit really hard and I really loved it. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7199.76s)]
*  I love getting better. I love the fear of it, too. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7202.52s)]
*  I love being terrified. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7204.6s)]
*  I love overcoming the fear of competition. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7206.2s)]
*  It was so fucking scary. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7209.72s)]
*  It was like it was like religious for you that wasn't. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7211.240000000001s)]
*  I was like a much a massive experience. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7214.08s)]
*  It was so religious that my girlfriend at the time wanted to fuck in the gym [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7218.52s)]
*  because I had the keys and I wouldn't have sex with her there. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7222.320000000001s)]
*  I'm like new. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7224.28s)]
*  Why? It's a sacred space. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7225.24s)]
*  We can't fuck in the church. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7226.4s)]
*  Even when no one was there, I would bow. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7227.679999999999s)]
*  That might have been a mistake. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7229.48s)]
*  I'd go into the gym. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7230.679999999999s)]
*  You should have fucked her. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7231.759999999999s)]
*  I fucked her plenty. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7232.719999999999s)]
*  All right. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7233.16s)]
*  So we're keeping it. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7235.0s)]
*  But like, like, OK, so I think that's so interesting [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7236.36s)]
*  that to trace the origin story of of your fuse being ignited, [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7239.759999999999s)]
*  because people look at you and they're like, OK, that dude is fucking on. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7245.4s)]
*  He's in it. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7250.16s)]
*  I've had people tell me that I'm in it. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7251.92s)]
*  You know, some of my friends, mutual friends are in it. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7254.88s)]
*  You know, when you're in it, you know, when you're in it, [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7258.16s)]
*  because you can't find that. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7260.48s)]
*  Well, they don't have the thing. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7262.28s)]
*  Whatever it is, like not everybody is going to be great at everything. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7264.12s)]
*  They're just not. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7268.36s)]
*  It's just some people just don't have the discipline, the desire. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7269.36s)]
*  They don't have the willpower to push through when they're tired. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7273.08s)]
*  They don't have the willpower to show up when they're feeling tired and lazy [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7275.639999999999s)]
*  or when they're uninspired. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7278.92s)]
*  I just you have to you have to learn that. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7280.8s)]
*  And you have to learn that through like if you want to get great. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7283.400000000001s)]
*  There's only one pathway. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7286.4800000000005s)]
*  There's only one pathway. It's hard work and discipline. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7288.2s)]
*  There's no other way. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7291.0s)]
*  And you might not get there still. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7292.24s)]
*  Because if you're hard work and you have discipline, [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7294.360000000001s)]
*  but you're you're competing against Mike Tyson, he also has that timing. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7297.08s)]
*  Yeah, he also has hard work and discipline, but superior genetics [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7301.320000000001s)]
*  and superior training hypnotized from the time he was 13. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7304.12s)]
*  You're fucked. Yeah, you're fucked. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7307.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I I I can remember. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7308.84s)]
*  When Canelo Alvarez first came into my gym and he was young, [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7313.6s)]
*  he was just starting to have a rep. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7317.0s)]
*  Everything about that guy [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7320.28s)]
*  wept of exceptionalism, the way he put his bag down, [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7323.400000000001s)]
*  the way he took his shoes out, right, the way he drank his water. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7327.24s)]
*  Every rep, every, you know, when he started to stretch, [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7332.08s)]
*  every single stretch, intentional, intentional as fuck. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7335.6s)]
*  Him starting to just lightly warm up on a heavy bag [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7340.360000000001s)]
*  felt he was absolutely exceptional. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7343.76s)]
*  And I try to tell other fighters in our gym and other people in general [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7347.64s)]
*  that like, you don't understand, it's it's not something you know, [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7352.72s)]
*  you see other pro fighters, I don't see a lot of them come to our gym [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7356.240000000001s)]
*  and they're talking to people and they're joking around [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7358.84s)]
*  and they're sort of, you know, taking a moment or two off. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7361.320000000001s)]
*  And then you look at all of them and these are good fighters. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7365.0s)]
*  I mean, these are pro fighters, but they're not exceptional. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7368.12s)]
*  And they don't have that intention. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7372.28s)]
*  And when I would see Canelo Alvarez or certain elite [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7374.44s)]
*  Crawford's done media days at our gym, they from the moment they walk in, [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7378.92s)]
*  everything about them, the way they take their sweatshirt off [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7384.28s)]
*  and fold it up and put it down. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7386.799999999999s)]
*  I'm like, that dude's a world fucking champion. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7388.679999999999s)]
*  Has nothing to do with the fighting. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7391.0s)]
*  The way their hands, they hold their hands out when they're getting taped. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7393.719999999999s)]
*  It's almost like every breath from the moment they walk in to walk out [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7398.0s)]
*  is so fucking exceptional. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7402.0s)]
*  And I look at all these other fighters, I go, no, you don't understand. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7404.92s)]
*  You don't. He's got something you don't have. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7407.44s)]
*  And you can still lose with all that because you're a fight bevel. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7410.08s)]
*  You might be. Yeah. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7414.84s)]
*  You might be competing against a guy who has a slightly better strategy [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7415.679999999999s)]
*  and maybe he's better at one thing that sets you off. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7419.24s)]
*  Yeah. And you want to beat that guy. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7422.48s)]
*  Well, you got to work even harder. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7424.64s)]
*  You got to go back and figure out what you did wrong. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7426.04s)]
*  You got to figure out where your flaws are and improve upon them, [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7428.48s)]
*  whether it's an endurance issue, whether it's a technique and strategy issue, [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7432.28s)]
*  whether it's pacing, whatever it is. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7436.16s)]
*  Floyd never lost. Right. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7438.84s)]
*  And I do. I have. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7440.44s)]
*  I totally agree with you. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7442.04s)]
*  What you said earlier that Floyd deserves. That's a great story. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7443.4s)]
*  I just for some reason have in my life over the years [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7446.44s)]
*  sometimes hated on him a little bit for a variety of reasons, [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7449.52s)]
*  mainly because of how defensive he was. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7452.84s)]
*  Now I know how great he is. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7454.76s)]
*  But I do sometimes look for inspiration in random places. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7456.360000000001s)]
*  And if I'm feeling like I need a reminder of what excellence is, [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7460.64s)]
*  I'll watch training videos from Vegas with Floyd, [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7464.6s)]
*  just him and his uncle or his dad just doing the mitts, [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7469.080000000001s)]
*  doing these like 15 minute rounds, just so smooth and effortless. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7472.360000000001s)]
*  And what does he say? Hard work? Easy work, hard work? [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7477.32s)]
*  Or I can't remember what his phrase is. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7481.48s)]
*  But the the beauty of like Mayweather training in a gym. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7483.16s)]
*  And I I just find that so interesting to look for people who are exceptional. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7489.48s)]
*  And it's a long road, man. It's a long road. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7496.88s)]
*  You're making a mountain one layer of pain at a time. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7500.16s)]
*  And you're you're competing against other people [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7503.32s)]
*  that are doing the exact same thing. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7505.5199999999995s)]
*  And if less you set yourself apart from the pack, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7506.8s)]
*  unless you're a guy like Marvin Haggard that goes to Cape Cod [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7509.8s)]
*  and trains in the winter, runs on the fucking sand, [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7512.64s)]
*  unless you're that guy that like pushes it past everybody else, [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7515.4400000000005s)]
*  you're not going to be exceptional. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7518.6s)]
*  And it's a it's a fucking struggle. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7520.04s)]
*  That's why some fighters, they reach a certain level of success [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7523.68s)]
*  and they sort of slack off. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7527.24s)]
*  And a lot of people thought Canelo was doing that [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7529.400000000001s)]
*  when he started playing golf all the time. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7530.92s)]
*  Like they're like, oh, he's not completely focused anymore. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7532.2s)]
*  And maybe this is why he doesn't want to fight Benavides. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7535.400000000001s)]
*  Might be might be a little true. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7537.68s)]
*  It also might be a money thing. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7539.96s)]
*  It might be like, look, I'll fight that guy. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7541.320000000001s)]
*  But I know what that fight is. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7542.84s)]
*  And I want 200 million dollars for that fight. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7544.4800000000005s)]
*  How about just like how hard it is to stay hungry [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7546.56s)]
*  when your refrigerator is that fucking full? [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7550.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You're kind of a good looking dude. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7552.16s)]
*  You have a beautiful wife. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7555.0s)]
*  You've got this Hacienda in Mexico that like Pablo Escobar [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7556.2s)]
*  would have killed for the stallions in the cars. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7560.320000000001s)]
*  And you got to go fucking deal with David Benavides. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7563.92s)]
*  Right. Like that's like when Rocky, when you had to go fight. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7567.44s)]
*  I can't remember who and he's all rich. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7571.08s)]
*  Clubber Lang. Yeah. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7572.36s)]
*  You go fight Clubber Lang. Rich. Yeah. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7573.32s)]
*  Like, OK, Canelo, however, I'll fight you poor. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7575.44s)]
*  But now I got to fight you rich. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7578.759999999999s)]
*  I got to wake up for like, oh. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7580.88s)]
*  Hagler always just say it's very difficult to wake up in the morning [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7583.08s)]
*  when you're sleeping in silk sheets. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7585.599999999999s)]
*  And like and and I do think about that also. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7588.4s)]
*  Like I have people asking me like, like, you know, [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7592.12s)]
*  we started talking about making American pride beautiful. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7595.92s)]
*  That was one hundred and forty five days up on a mountain, you know, [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7598.48s)]
*  in standing on ice with clamp on your shoes because we're on ski mountains [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7602.68s)]
*  and there's fucking wind and it's fucking miserable. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7608.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm like, people like, why? Why are you doing this shit? [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7612.0s)]
*  I'm like, because I fucking love it. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7616.36s)]
*  You fucking love it. I love it. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7619.24s)]
*  But they're like, but but we could like, you know, I got a boat. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7621.12s)]
*  We're going to go into the Mediterranean. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7624.44s)]
*  I'm like, no, I'm going to be up on the mountain. Yeah. And like [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7626.24s)]
*  staying hungry is a I don't know. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7630.2s)]
*  But it all depends on what your motivation is. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7633.72s)]
*  If your motivation is just get wealthy and then once you reach that point, [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7635.88s)]
*  now you're fucked because now you don't have this motivation anymore. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7639.84s)]
*  If your motivation is the big house and the big cars and all that bullshit. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7642.84s)]
*  But if your motivation is excellence, you can maintain that motivation [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7646.599999999999s)]
*  no matter what your financial state is forever. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7649.92s)]
*  It's an unlimited source. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7651.96s)]
*  And that's the necklace I wear pleasing to God as a creation of beautiful. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7653.04s)]
*  That's what it says on your neck. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7657.64s)]
*  Yeah. The only thing pleasing to God is the creation of beautiful [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7658.56s)]
*  and exalted things. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7661.76s)]
*  Is that quote? [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7663.16s)]
*  Because it reminds me, dude, like, OK, I don't I'll enjoy. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7664.32s)]
*  Like you want to take me to a fancy Michelin restaurant here in Austin. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7669.32s)]
*  OK, you want to take me to Guero's and fucking have some ribs. OK. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7673.56s)]
*  Like, I don't care. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7678.5199999999995s)]
*  And I mean, I appreciate it. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7680.5199999999995s)]
*  But it's not your primary. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7683.48s)]
*  No fucking no. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7685.0s)]
*  Your primary motivation is not to show up at the big party [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7686.48s)]
*  and have everybody kiss your ass. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7689.16s)]
*  No, it's creation, creation of great art. Correct. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7690.76s)]
*  Yeah. And if you're a fighter, it's the same thing. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7693.36s)]
*  It's like to to be excellent, to be unstoppable, [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7695.639999999999s)]
*  to be the best of the best. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7700.0s)]
*  And if you have that motivation, you can maintain that with wealth. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7701.48s)]
*  You can still get hungry to be Canelo and come out and fight David Benavides. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7704.68s)]
*  But it's obviously very hard to do, [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7708.92s)]
*  which is why most fighters don't maintain it once they achieve wealth. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7711.12s)]
*  Who's the best? [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7715.240000000001s)]
*  Who's the best? [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7717.16s)]
*  Like, I think Tom Brady is a great example of like someone that was able to just. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7717.88s)]
*  Yes. Like reignite the fucking beast. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7722.08s)]
*  Yes. Kobe Bryant, I guess. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7724.68s)]
*  You know, yes. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7727.84s)]
*  But like fighters or people that you know that I just think [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7729.92s)]
*  it's interesting to think about. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7734.2s)]
*  It's a different thing, though. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7735.2s)]
*  Sports and fighting are a different thing because you don't play boxing. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7736.28s)]
*  Yeah, you don't play it. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7740.2s)]
*  It's like you could decide that you're going to still maintain [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7741.48s)]
*  a very high level of basketball and you enjoy you want to just be excellent. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7744.44s)]
*  But no one's kicking you in the legs, you know, no one's taking you down, [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7748.2s)]
*  strangling you. Who's the is George St. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7752.16s)]
*  Pierre that's been able to like who is it? [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7754.32s)]
*  John Jones that in your mind is like curious in that they were able to [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7756.72s)]
*  with a full fridge and comfortable sheets. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7763.280000000001s)]
*  Just keep fucking. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7765.72s)]
*  But John Jones is exceptional because John Jones beat a lot of guys [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7767.0s)]
*  when he wasn't training. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7770.04s)]
*  There was times in his life where he was fucking off and partying all the time [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7771.200000000001s)]
*  and still beating the best guys in the world. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7774.280000000001s)]
*  That was like the the when he had that press conference with Daniel Cormier. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7775.8s)]
*  He goes, I beat you when I was doing coke. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7780.04s)]
*  Coke. Yeah. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7781.92s)]
*  That's such an insult. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7783.92s)]
*  What's the worst insult in that? [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7785.6s)]
*  I was doing I was high on fucking eight balls and I beat your ass. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7788.080000000001s)]
*  Well, John talked to me about it. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7791.4s)]
*  He said, I used to when I was younger, I used to give myself an excuse. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7792.599999999999s)]
*  So I would party really hard like a week before the fight, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7796.4s)]
*  which you should never do. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7799.24s)]
*  And it's like, well, if I lose, you know, maybe it's because I partied. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7800.759999999999s)]
*  But he doesn't he doesn't do that now. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7805.08s)]
*  Now he thoroughly prepares. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7807.32s)]
*  And he went through a time when he was the light heavyweight champion, [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7809.679999999999s)]
*  when he was kind of like playing with his food, [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7811.96s)]
*  because he was just so much better than everybody else. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7813.84s)]
*  He wasn't he wasn't threatened by people. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7816.36s)]
*  So he wasn't putting on the performances that he did when he was younger. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7818.639999999999s)]
*  Like when he won the title against Shogun, he lost some of that motivation, [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7821.2s)]
*  but then gained it later in life when he went through a bunch of legal struggles, [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7826.32s)]
*  a lot of problems and realized like this could all be taken away from me. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7830.72s)]
*  I got to get back to what made me great. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7834.12s)]
*  And then, you know, won the heavyweight title, defended against the greatest [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7836.5599999999995s)]
*  and steeped me out, Chichin. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7840.12s)]
*  You know, now he's the heavyweight champion of the UFC. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7841.76s)]
*  What do you think he's been fighting? [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7843.92s)]
*  He's how many on the title in what, like 2008? [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7845.4s)]
*  When did what year did John Jones win the title? [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7848.92s)]
*  Which is just that's insane. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7852.2s)]
*  Fucking crazy. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7853.8s)]
*  And he's 40 now. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7855.12s)]
*  He's in his 30s. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7856.72s)]
*  He's 30. He's the youngest ever champion in the UFC. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7858.32s)]
*  He won the title at 22 years old. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7861.88s)]
*  2011. OK, so he has been a world champion for 14 years. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7865.04s)]
*  That is unheard of. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7870.08s)]
*  So he has to be the greatest fighter in the history of the UFC, [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7871.84s)]
*  greater than George St. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7874.44s)]
*  Pierre, I mean, right? Like, I think on paper, for sure. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7875.96s)]
*  I think the problem with that is like, who did he fight [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7879.32s)]
*  versus who did George St. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7882.2s)]
*  Pierre fight? Who did Khabib fight versus who did George St. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7883.24s)]
*  Pierre? Like, it's like who did Mighty Mouse fight versus... [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7886.5599999999995s)]
*  OK, but so according to that, who do you put number one based on those metrics? [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7888.96s)]
*  Well, out of just the sheer longevity and the accomplishments, I say John Jones. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7893.84s)]
*  But I could see the argument for Mighty Mouse being the best [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7898.12s)]
*  martial artist I've ever seen. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7902.4s)]
*  I think he's the best expression of martial arts talent [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7904.4s)]
*  and technique that I've ever seen. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7907.52s)]
*  But then George St. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7909.400000000001s)]
*  Pierre is right up there, too. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7910.160000000001s)]
*  And George St. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7911.320000000001s)]
*  Pierre was, you know, multiple division world champion. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7911.88s)]
*  He won the welterweight title, then he won the middleweight title. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7915.280000000001s)]
*  And then he came back after four years off and beat Michael Bissping [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7918.96s)]
*  for the middleweight title. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7922.56s)]
*  Like, he's he's in the argument, too. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7923.4400000000005s)]
*  I just think there's a real problem with saying the number one of all time, [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7925.6s)]
*  the greatest of all time. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7928.92s)]
*  But if you were going to give it to somebody, I would say give it to John. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7929.92s)]
*  When you think about John and like like what [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7932.120000000001s)]
*  how he's been able to do it for this long and go through these highs and lows and [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7935.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, fighting and doing blow like that's funny. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7940.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like, well, he's that talented. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7943.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, he's that good. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7945.88s)]
*  He's an intelligent psychopath. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7947.5199999999995s)]
*  Like like, but what what's in there, you know, like to what we're talking about. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7948.96s)]
*  What's the like? [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7952.84s)]
*  Yeah. What's driving that motherfucker? [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7954.5599999999995s)]
*  No, you can't you can't. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7956.48s)]
*  You can't manufacture that. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7958.48s)]
*  You either are that guy or you are not that guy. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7960.2s)]
*  So that's pure nature. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7962.36s)]
*  It's a lot of things. It's how he grew up. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7964.68s)]
*  He has two savage brothers. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7966.48s)]
*  Both of them are NFL players, superior athletes. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7968.48s)]
*  They beat each other up all the time. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7971.28s)]
*  I'm sure. Yeah. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7972.84s)]
*  You know, it's like you're in a competitive environment from the time you're young. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7973.84s)]
*  You have incredible genetics on top of that. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7977.12s)]
*  Then you go to a place like Jackson Winklejohn that is superior training [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7979.28s)]
*  with world class sparring partners, world class coaches, world class recovery, [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7983.44s)]
*  training facilities, technique strategy, all the above. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7987.76s)]
*  It's like you need a perfect storm to be a real, true all time great. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7990.96s)]
*  Do you think that because sometimes I think we're [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=7996.64s)]
*  that having of being fucked up can work to your advantage [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8001.04s)]
*  and having addictive tendencies and being like being able to harness [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8004.6s)]
*  addictive tendencies tendencies into something as violent as [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8009.2s)]
*  and to be able to apply those to a sport versus just being, [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8014.36s)]
*  well, I'm a well adjusted human being with no addictive tendencies, [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8018.92s)]
*  not a lot of trauma. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8022.32s)]
*  I'm going to I'm going to fight you. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8023.64s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm a fucking beast that grew up in a fight. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8025.32s)]
*  And like Mike Tyson grew up, I don't even understand [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8028.36s)]
*  if you grew up inside or outside, dealt with fucking ignited [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8032.68s)]
*  torments, drug addictions, violence. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8036.92s)]
*  And I will kill. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8039.76s)]
*  And and I guess [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8041.8s)]
*  that's always interesting to look at how well adjusted people do [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8045.400000000001s)]
*  versus people that have real trauma when it gets fucking brutal. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8049.76s)]
*  I think there's some real value to being out of your fucking mind. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8053.76s)]
*  I really do. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8058.360000000001s)]
*  And I think some of the greatest artists, some of the greatest athletes, [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8059.52s)]
*  some of the greatest accomplishments were achieved [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8062.4400000000005s)]
*  by people that were out of their fucking mind and just had pushed it to a level [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8065.8s)]
*  to a level and into an area that other people weren't willing to go. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8070.84s)]
*  And that's how they became the best of the best. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8074.88s)]
*  And you don't get to be a Michael Jordan unless you're out of your fucking mind. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8076.88s)]
*  I know maybe an Elon Musk. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8080.64s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8082.04s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Similar. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8083.56s)]

*  Mm hmm. Even when they trust you, you still have to know how to play it. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8621.16s)]
*  Even if you're, you know. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8625.44s)]

*  you know, for the most part, that there's there's financial parameters [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8636.92s)]
*  and you have to be able to accept that and play that because [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8641.36s)]
*  you're playing in a serious game like our bosses, they don't give a fuck. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8644.36s)]
*  They're all publicly held now and they're looking at stock prices. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8648.4s)]

*  and just pure and think about like, oh, I just you know, like you actually were [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8656.44s)]
*  when you were doing your podcast, like I kind of was when I was in Minnesota [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8661.279999999999s)]
*  making little movies and doing all this idiotic shit that got my dad to say, [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8665.0s)]
*  oh, you're going to make gay porn, you fucking idiot. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8669.84s)]
*  This little phase of, oh, isn't I was in Minnesota [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8673.8s)]
*  and St. Paul in this small school. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8677.28s)]
*  And I'm like, I just fucking love this shit. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8679.640000000001s)]
*  Just like your first book. I just loved it. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8681.76s)]
*  But I'm like, I tell people, if you just want to be an artist, [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8684.2s)]
*  go write plays in Oklahoma City and just stay over out there. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8687.08s)]
*  But if you want to like step into this arena, like. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8691.880000000001s)]
*  It's tricky, you know. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8697.560000000001s)]
*  Well, you have to be all in. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8698.76s)]
*  And you have to realize that this is a very high failure rate. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8700.480000000001s)]
*  And yet even all in, just like fighting, you still might not make. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8704.0s)]
*  You might not make it. Yeah. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8707.28s)]
*  I mean, acting is the best example that there's I mean, we talked about [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8708.36s)]
*  Tim McGraw being amazing. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8711.76s)]
*  How many amazing actors out there that don't act? [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8712.92s)]
*  There's a lot. There's a lot of people that can act. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8715.12s)]
*  You can take them and they can figure out how to do it. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8716.92s)]
*  It's a weird skill that some people either have or don't have. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8719.76s)]
*  Some people have the ability. You can definitely get better at it. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8723.04s)]
*  There's definitely like people that that train very hard. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8725.44s)]
*  And there's method acting and there's all sorts of different strategies. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8729.08s)]
*  But the reality is there are a small number of roles [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8731.76s)]
*  and a large number of people and they're auditioning for these things. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8736.8s)]
*  And if you don't get into one, you probably won't get the other. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8740.24s)]
*  And it might be five, ten, fifteen years and you've had no success [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8743.279999999999s)]
*  and you don't know what the fuck to do. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8747.32s)]
*  And you can quit or you can do with Billy Bob Thornton is [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8748.519999999999s)]

*  And then all of a sudden, boom, he takes off. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8753.0s)]
*  Well, that's what the reason I got into directing was I was trying to act [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8754.72s)]
*  and I was having mixed success and I was getting very scared that, you know, [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8760.32s)]
*  you could like prepare for an audition for five days and I know everything [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8764.279999999999s)]
*  and I'm ready and I'm all in and I go in and I laugh. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8768.64s)]
*  I get 30 seconds of the director's time and you find out like, oh, [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8772.88s)]
*  you look like the dude that the director's girlfriend cheated on him. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8777.32s)]
*  And he's like, you were dead before it started. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8781.32s)]
*  Then I was I was on this TV show, Chicago Hope. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8783.56s)]
*  It was a hospital drama. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8787.52s)]
*  And I was kind of getting a little famous. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8789.12s)]
*  I played a TV doctor, Billy Crunk, and people kept calling me Billy. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8790.880000000001s)]
*  Whenever I walked down the street like, hey, Billy, what's up, Billy, Billy, Billy? [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8795.36s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, my fucking God, this is going to be my legacy [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8799.0s)]
*  as being this TV fucking doctor, Billy. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8802.28s)]
*  And I was on an airplane going from L.A. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8805.640000000001s)]
*  to New York and I'm sitting there and this guy walks by me and he stops. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8808.400000000001s)]

*  And I'm like, fuck this shit. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8829.2s)]
*  I'm like, I've been busting my ass. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8832.4s)]
*  I'm barely making it as an actor and people are showing me their rash. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8835.04s)]
*  I'm like, I got to fucking do my own sling blade. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8838.76s)]
*  And I did very bad things and still got the worst review [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8841.08s)]
*  ever in the history of reviews. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8845.16s)]
*  But it started my career. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8847.24s)]
*  It was a good movie. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8848.6s)]
*  You know, you know, it's that critic, but you know, it saved me. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8849.56s)]
*  So I get the horrible review. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8852.88s)]
*  I throw up and I'm literally in on death's fucking door. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8854.64s)]
*  Like I'm done. I have no career. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8859.4s)]
*  I get a phone call at night from a woman named [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8861.32s)]
*  her name is Kelly Chapman Myers. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8865.88s)]
*  She was married to Ron Meyer, who used to run Universal. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8867.36s)]
*  And she's like, he was a huge fucking guy. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8870.6s)]
*  Ron Meyer was a big, big mogul in our business. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8873.0s)]
*  And I could hear these guys laughing. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8875.72s)]
*  And she's like, Pete, Pete, I'm on the boat with Ron and Steven [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8878.04s)]
*  and David Spielberg and David Geffen. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8882.44s)]
*  Oh, wow. And I know we're watching your movie [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8885.44s)]
*  and they're laughing like little fucking frat boys. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8887.96s)]
*  And fucking Ron Meyer gets the phone and he's like, this is fucking great. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8890.84s)]
*  And I'm holding the review of Kenneth Turan. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8894.92s)]

*  Let's go. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8906.199999999999s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8908.64s)]
*  So they say, well, they were right. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8909.72s)]
*  And the critic was wrong. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8911.64s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8912.8s)]
*  But I think a lot of those critics probably wanted to beat you [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8913.439999999999s)]
*  and they didn't didn't get the chance and they failed and they got this job [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8915.68s)]
*  and then they shit on everything. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8919.08s)]
*  And you got to be able to take the hits. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8920.56s)]
*  And I took the hit, you know, like it strengthens you. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8922.599999999999s)]
*  It strengthens your resolve. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8925.599999999999s)]
*  Go as a get knocked down seven, get up eight. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8926.92s)]
*  I believe in that. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8929.52s)]
*  Like, like if it's just all good all the time. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8930.44s)]
*  I think you get knocked down seven, you get up seven. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8936.0s)]
*  I think you have to get you knocked down seven. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8938.16s)]
*  No, you get knocked down seven. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8941.24s)]
*  Seven. You get up. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8942.640000000001s)]
*  You get up for the time. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8943.76s)]
*  No, seven times. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8945.36s)]
*  You get knocked down the seventh time. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8947.04s)]
*  It's a phrase. It's a phrase. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8948.320000000002s)]
*  It sucks. Get knocked down seven. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8949.640000000001s)]
*  Get up seven or get knocked down seven. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8951.640000000001s)]
*  Well, whoever made the phrase, they're wrong. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8953.480000000001s)]
*  No, because you get knocked down. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8955.2s)]
*  You get up. Right. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8956.92s)]
*  But one time, if you start up and get knocked down, one, one. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8957.72s)]
*  You're one ahead of getting up because you started up. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8962.439999999999s)]
*  No, no. You get knocked down one. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8965.24s)]
*  You get up one. You get knocked down to fall down seven. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8967.24s)]
*  Get up eight. Yeah, they're retarded. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8970.48s)]

*  Yeah. Every time you get knocked down, you get up. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8979.679999999998s)]
*  You can't get up if you haven't been knocked down. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8981.279999999999s)]
*  That's stupid. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8982.96s)]
*  If you get knocked down seven times, you get up seven times. Period. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8983.8s)]
*  It's like math, man. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8986.96s)]
*  You're making me do math. Well, it's just they're just delusion. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=8988.16s)]

*  But then eventually I caught up. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9145.2s)]
*  You know, it's just you just keep working. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9147.52s)]
*  That's all it is. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9149.32s)]
*  All it is is like keep improving and working. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9150.64s)]
*  And if you don't have the desire to keep improving and working, [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9153.56s)]
*  you should get out because you're in the wrong business, [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9156.04s)]
*  because there's going to be a bunch of people that do have that desire. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9158.28s)]
*  And if you want to live a life of mediocrity and half-assedness [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9160.52s)]
*  and just fucking kind of showing up and doing the bare minimum, [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9164.44s)]
*  like what kind of a fucking life is that? That's not fun. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9168.640000000001s)]
*  That's not exciting. That's not stimulating. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9172.32s)]
*  One of the things some people don't have drive. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9174.6s)]
*  They don't have this desire. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9177.720000000001s)]
*  You can't you can't like you can't make a championship fighter [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9178.84s)]
*  out of someone who doesn't like working out like you can't. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9182.800000000001s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9185.28s)]
*  Like you have to have something inside you, a calling, [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9186.48s)]
*  to whatever you do. And for you, it is filmmaking. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9190.44s)]
*  You have a calling to this thing. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9192.76s)]
*  It's a passion project. It's love. It's art. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9194.640000000001s)]
*  It's intensity. It's discipline and focus. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9197.36s)]
*  And you're trying to make the best fucking thing you can make. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9200.08s)]
*  And if you're not doing that, you shouldn't be doing what you're doing. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9202.84s)]
*  Or you need to come to Jesus moment. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9206.400000000001s)]
*  You need a refocusing. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9208.560000000001s)]
*  You need something that real that like Pressfield had, [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9210.12s)]
*  where he realized he was kind of like 40 years old and like half-assing his life. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9213.12s)]
*  He turned it around. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9216.880000000001s)]
*  And he talks about how he turned it around by deciding that he's a professional [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9217.84s)]
*  and amazing career since then, right, which is kind of spectacular. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9221.2s)]
*  For anyone that doesn't know Steven Pressfield and they're like, [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9224.4s)]
*  they want to do anything like writing sports podcast. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9227.2s)]
*  That motherfucker has laid it out. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9231.76s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm not a big fan of like self-help. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9234.12s)]
*  Tell me shit like the war of art that that did, in my opinion. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9237.0s)]
*  And I think yours. That's the real deal. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9242.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's a guidebook. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9245.84s)]
*  It's a guidebook for creativity and discipline and becoming a professional. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9247.240000000002s)]
*  You know, and he he really laid it out and he laid it out also [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9251.0s)]
*  with his own personal examples of failure, which I think are very important. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9254.12s)]
*  Like, you need to know like that this struggle that you're experiencing [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9257.320000000002s)]
*  when you feel like you're fucking up. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9260.560000000001s)]
*  Everybody has that. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9263.12s)]
*  Nobody is just like gung ho the best of the best right out of the gate. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9264.720000000001s)]
*  You learn, you improve. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9268.92s)]
*  It's a long, slow journey. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9270.44s)]
*  It takes a lot of fucking work. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9274.28s)]
*  And if you're not interested in doing that, well, you better find something else. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9275.8s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that aren't interested in that. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9279.16s)]
*  A lot of people just want to do a job where they make some money. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9280.8s)]
*  And then at the end of the day, they can go play video games, hang out with their kids. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9283.16s)]
*  That's great. There's nothing wrong with that. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9286.64s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9288.84s)]
*  But if you want to do something that's extraordinary, that's very hard, [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9290.0s)]
*  it's going to take extraordinary effort. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9293.56s)]
*  It's going to take extraordinary discipline and willpower. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9295.88s)]
*  And it's going to take objectivity. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9298.4s)]
*  You're going to have to have introspection. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9299.8s)]
*  It's going to be a lot of things. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9301.84s)]
*  You're going to have to a lot of soul searching. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9302.96s)]
*  And you still might fucking get your ass kicked. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9304.52s)]
*  You still might get your ass kicked. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9306.32s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9307.56s)]
*  Yeah. But that's why when people do succeed and someone can put together [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9308.72s)]
*  something like American Primeval, it's so fantastic because we know how hard it is to do. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9312.359999999999s)]
*  It's not easy. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9318.24s)]
*  Are you going to apologize to your wife for me or do I have to? [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9319.119999999999s)]
*  She's used to watching. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9322.48s)]
*  She's fucking freaked out in Nosferatu, too. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9324.039999999999s)]
*  She hated that. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9326.08s)]
*  Did you have to watch that movie at the climax that I was doing? [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9326.72s)]
*  I'm not going to watch that with her. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9330.32s)]
*  But no, no, no, definitely don't watch it with her. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9331.279999999999s)]
*  So the climax, tell everybody you were telling me about it in the gym. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9334.36s)]
*  Last night, I watched this film [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9337.480000000001s)]
*  called The Climax. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9341.560000000001s)]
*  It's made by this French director who's made some really fucked up gas. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9343.6s)]
*  Gaspard, no, his name is he's from. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9348.76s)]
*  My son made me watch this film [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9352.84s)]
*  and he's he's this guy's made some really fucked up films. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9355.400000000001s)]
*  And I don't recommend them if you if you have like any sensitivity, [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9358.36s)]
*  because this guy is the hardest filmmaker out there right now. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9362.36s)]
*  In my opinion, like these are fucking intense movies. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9366.2s)]
*  They weren't called irreversible. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9369.24s)]
*  Did one called Enter the Void. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9370.84s)]
*  And they're about drugs and death and sex. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9372.720000000001s)]
*  And they're very experiential. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9376.04s)]
*  So you feel like you're. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9378.04s)]
*  Yeah, so this is it. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9380.36s)]
*  This is the climax. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9381.32s)]
*  And it's about these dancers [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9382.960000000001s)]
*  who accidentally drink a bunch of fucking LSD. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9385.44s)]
*  And this is the hardest film I think I've ever seen in my life. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9389.04s)]
*  And you feel like you are on a very, very, very bad LSD trip. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9394.84s)]
*  Is this in subtitles? Yeah, it's French. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9400.92s)]
*  It's French, but its language is almost irrelevant. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9403.28s)]
*  But if you want to, I don't I don't recommend LSD for [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9406.92s)]
*  because I'm not a doctor and I think it's very dangerous. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9411.640000000001s)]
*  And I've done LSD and I've had some pretty intense experiences on it. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9414.92s)]
*  But this is a brilliantly deranged [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9419.560000000001s)]
*  trip into, you know, ever. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9423.4s)]
*  Have you ever had a bad trip like a really bad trip? [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9425.84s)]
*  Not really. So I haven't either. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9428.24s)]
*  And I've done, you know, some of the DMT and the five M.U.O. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9430.0s)]
*  and, you know, mushrooms. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9433.2s)]
*  I've had powerful experiences. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9435.08s)]
*  But I did have one bad experience on LSD the first time I ever took it. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9437.28s)]
*  And none of us had ever taken it before. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9442.0s)]
*  So we didn't feel it. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9443.76s)]
*  So we took another hit thinking that. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9445.2s)]
*  So we all basically were a bunch of high school kids in New York City [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9447.08s)]
*  trying to go to a Santana concert. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9450.12s)]
*  And we just started fucking tripping out. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9452.08s)]
*  And it was scary. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9455.960000000001s)]
*  It was actually really, really scary. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9458.12s)]
*  This movie is a experientially. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9460.08s)]
*  It becomes. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9464.64s)]
*  And this is something that is one of my strategies [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9465.56s)]
*  when I make in movies is I don't want my movie to be a part, [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9468.56s)]
*  a spectator sport. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9472.96s)]
*  I don't want you watching it. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9474.359999999999s)]
*  I want you participating. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9475.72s)]
*  I want to try and grab you by the throat and make you watch [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9477.279999999999s)]
*  and be like, come on, bro. Watch. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9481.679999999998s)]
*  Put the fucking phone down. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9483.64s)]
*  I want to own your heart and your mind and your pulse [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9485.279999999999s)]
*  while you're watching my films. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9488.439999999999s)]
*  That's just a goal. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9490.0s)]
*  Some sometimes I do better than others, but that's always the goal. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9491.72s)]
*  I don't want you kind of sitting back watching this motherfucker. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9495.76s)]
*  Gaspar, no, he takes you into it in a way that [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9499.52s)]
*  I'm sure a lot of people will hate it. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9504.56s)]
*  I mean, people see the guy that is like speaks to you the most right now. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9506.56s)]
*  No, I don't. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9511.6s)]
*  I mean, there's a part of me like so I'm getting ready to make a film [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9513.039999999999s)]
*  called Mosquito Bowl, this war movie. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9516.36s)]
*  And these young kids went through, I don't know if you know, [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9518.6s)]
*  the Pacific Theater campaign and what the battles of Tarawa and Guadalcanal [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9522.28s)]
*  and Okinawa, these were hellacious, awful, fucking violent fights. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9526.88s)]
*  And the Japanese wouldn't surrender and they believed in Emperor [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9532.08s)]
*  Horigito, so they would fight to the death. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9535.24s)]
*  You know, Banzai charges and Sepik, they would kill themselves before they would [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9537.48s)]
*  be taken prisoner. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9542.72s)]
*  And World War Two, you had these young American kids who in our movie [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9544.119999999999s)]
*  were college football players who Pearl Harbor hits. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9547.72s)]
*  And they immediately joined the military and they have to go fight these fucking [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9551.16s)]
*  horrific battles like just people's throats getting blown out and torturing [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9555.48s)]
*  and killing and suicides from the locals. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9560.84s)]
*  Suicide. And so to me, one of my goals with this next film [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9564.6s)]
*  is I want to try because been a lot of good war films and just like there [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9569.24s)]
*  have been a lot of good Westerns. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9573.0s)]
*  And I always said, well, I never got to make one. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9574.16s)]
*  So I want to try and make a Western. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9576.28s)]
*  I was American Primal. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9577.6s)]
*  Been a lot of great war films, great war films, but I never got to make one. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9579.28s)]
*  So my take is to try and bring people into the experience. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9583.4s)]
*  But you have you have made war films. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9587.56s)]
*  World War Two. Oh, OK. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9590.039999999999s)]
*  So you're right. I made I made Lone Survivor. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9592.08s)]
*  I never made a World War Two film. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9593.8s)]
*  And there have been a lot of great ones, you know, from Private Ryan to Hexel Ridge. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9596.48s)]
*  Private Ryan was probably the first one that was realistic, though, right? [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9600.32s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that opening scene. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9603.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That which is which is like why Steve for anyone. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9605.84s)]
*  Like you asked me who I look up to, Steven Spielberg. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9609.119999999999s)]
*  He is so far ahead, the goat of my business to think that the guy who did fucking [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9611.52s)]
*  Jurassic Park and E.T. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9618.2s)]
*  God love both. Close Encounters. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9620.4s)]
*  Then is like, oh, you know, the in Spielberg was always like the good boy [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9622.4s)]
*  of the because I was like he was growing up with like Coppola and Scorsese [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9626.04s)]
*  and Michael Mann. And these guys were like, fuck, ready. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9630.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were just fucking hard partying motherfucker. Right. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9632.68s)]
*  You know, hard drinking, hard drugging, hard fucking filmmakers. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9636.16s)]
*  And Steven was like the good, goody good kid. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9640.08s)]
*  Right. Like, well, little Steven, he's got to go home soon. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9643.08s)]
*  Put the wait. Don't keep the girls in the garage. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9647.08s)]
*  Steven's still here. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9649.8s)]
*  And then Steven's like, oh, really? [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9651.08s)]
*  And then he makes, you know, [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9652.8s)]
*  saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List. Right. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9655.759999999998s)]
*  And these were like, you goes, oh, really? [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9659.24s)]
*  You don't think that I know how to do war. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9661.0s)]
*  Saving Private Ryan was like another fucking level. Another level. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9663.48s)]
*  So to answer your question, Spielberg, so I look up to still the most. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9668.88s)]
*  And I think he's on a whole nother level based on the scope of his work. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9673.16s)]
*  But Gaspar, no, if I'm thinking about the thing I got out of watching this film [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9678.279999999999s)]
*  that I would try and use in my own way for for Mosquito Bowl, for a war movie, [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9683.119999999999s)]
*  is the idea that you want to try and take the audience [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9688.96s)]
*  into what it would have been like to try and get on that fucking beach. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9692.119999999999s)]
*  And, you know, in the case of my film, [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9696.16s)]
*  there was a battle of Tarawa and they were trying to get a shore, [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9699.119999999999s)]
*  but they fucked up the tides. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9702.48s)]
*  So they came in and the tides were too low. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9704.48s)]
*  So those landing craft all got stuck on the tides on the coral reef. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9706.439999999999s)]
*  And they started getting bombed by the Japanese who were hiding in the caves. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9711.039999999999s)]
*  And they brought their big guns out. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9715.24s)]
*  So these kids were getting blown up before they even got to the fucking beach. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9716.88s)]
*  They were getting killed. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9721.96s)]
*  And they're, you know, best friends or body parts are floating in the fucking oceans. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9723.160000000002s)]
*  And there's sharks and there's giant surf waves. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9727.640000000001s)]
*  And they're getting rocked before they've ever even got. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9730.92s)]
*  So I'm like, OK, well, how do I want to show that? [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9734.960000000001s)]
*  Like, and I look at a movie like Climax, and I'm like, all right, different horror. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9739.04s)]
*  Bad acid, bad LSD. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9745.12s)]
*  But my God, you're like I had to stop watching it. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9747.240000000002s)]
*  And I knew I was coming in here today. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9750.84s)]
*  And I'm starting to have an anxiety attack because I want to get sleep to do, [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9752.8s)]
*  you know, to talk to you. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9756.119999999999s)]
*  And I'm fucking watching this movie and I'm all worked up [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9757.119999999999s)]
*  because he's taken me into the fucking experience. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9760.199999999999s)]
*  And he does his movie into the void is about DMT. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9765.119999999999s)]
*  And he takes you into the experience of DMT. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9768.56s)]
*  So for anyone [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9771.72s)]
*  who doesn't ever want to experience and, you know, things that you've touched [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9774.08s)]
*  and I've touched, watch, you can watch these movies [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9779.039999999999s)]
*  and you can be like, whoa, I'm getting that feeling. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9782.48s)]
*  And that's a that's a real accomplishment for a filmmaker. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9787.48s)]
*  And I it's immersive. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9790.76s)]
*  So watch it. But don't let your wife. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9793.119999999999s)]
*  I'll definitely watch it. Do not like I don't want to shit. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9794.92s)]
*  I don't want to worry. She's not going to. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9797.92s)]
*  It is not for everyone. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9800.32s)]
*  I can't talk her into watching anything that she doesn't want to watch. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9801.84s)]
*  She only watched American Primeval because I told her it was going to be really awesome. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9804.76s)]
*  And she loves Yellowstone in 1883, but there was like [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9808.119999999999s)]
*  we're violent. It's violent. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9812.48s)]
*  Well, it's also it's that time period. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9815.0s)]
*  I think we do have. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9818.439999999999s)]
*  We do have a bit of a problem culturally, because a lot of the films [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9821.6s)]
*  that were created in the early days about the Wild West were very glossy. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9825.52s)]
*  They were very whitewashed. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9829.4s)]
*  It wasn't an accurate representation of what actually went down. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9831.4s)]
*  You know, film in the 1960s and 70s in particular, [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9834.92s)]
*  when it covered that subject like spaghetti westerns, you know, great films. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9838.52s)]
*  But it just never really quite captured the reality. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9843.0s)]
*  I don't think filmmaking was really ready for that experience, because I think [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9846.720000000001s)]
*  the the settling of the West [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9852.0s)]
*  and making their way across the plains in particular [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9855.640000000001s)]
*  and dealing with the Comanche and the Plains Indians like it is [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9858.76s)]
*  one of the most brutal experiences in human history. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9862.08s)]
*  They couldn't look at it in film back then. There's no way. Right. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9865.28s)]
*  People have asked like, well, you know, [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9869.08s)]
*  when I was making it, is there going to be sex in the film? [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9871.84s)]
*  Like Isaac and Sarah, are they going to fall in love or they can have sex? [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9875.16s)]
*  I'm like, are you fucking can you imagine what they would have smelled like? [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9878.6s)]
*  Just think about just odor. Yeah. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9885.36s)]
*  From head to toe, there's no way these people are going to have sex. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9887.880000000001s)]
*  There is no way they were going to smell each other or taste each other [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9892.560000000001s)]
*  in any fucking way. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9895.76s)]
*  And and that was like, you know, [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9897.6s)]
*  when we were talking, we were putting it together and we're writing it [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9900.6s)]
*  and, you know, Mark, and we're like, well, should they have sex? [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9903.119999999999s)]
*  And we're like, there's no fucking way. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9905.96s)]
*  Just that alone. Right. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9908.24s)]
*  Would have been amazing to me that people did have sex. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9910.16s)]
*  That were wanted to fuck each other. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9914.84s)]
*  Like, get the fuck away from me. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9916.92s)]
*  Yeah, they barely washed back then. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9919.359999999999s)]
*  Barely. They never brushed their teeth. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9921.0s)]
*  And making their way across the country. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9923.8s)]
*  There's I mean, your months on end. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9925.56s)]
*  Same clothes. No sanitation. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9928.24s)]
*  Women didn't know tampons. Right. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9931.16s)]
*  Like there's no toilet paper. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9933.199999999999s)]
*  They didn't have Japanese toilets that blow water up your ass [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9936.0s)]
*  and you can fucking dry yourself. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9939.039999999999s)]
*  This was a messy fucking world in there. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9943.88s)]
*  We're not going to make. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9946.36s)]
*  And I wanted to do a scene where [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9947.68s)]
*  Taylor Taylor, Taylor Kitsch's character has to shit and he's constipated. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9952.08s)]
*  And he's got to use. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9957.24s)]
*  Sticks to help him get it out, because that we had read about that, [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9959.599999999999s)]
*  about that was how you had to shit because you were constipated all the time. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9963.32s)]
*  She would have to stick wood up your ass and broke it up and force it out. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9966.599999999999s)]
*  And we had that scene written. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9972.56s)]
*  And I called that one off. But. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9976.599999999999s)]
*  By the way, Taylor Kitsch is fucking great. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9980.519999999999s)]
*  He's a beast. That scene in the first episode when they first meet him [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9983.240000000002s)]
*  and he has to take off his clothes and he's changing. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9987.0s)]
*  And you see the scars all over his body like, holy shit. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9989.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's he's really good in that movie. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9994.28s)]
*  And that show, he's he's really. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9997.400000000001s)]
*  Teller. Teller is such a great, great guy and a great actor. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=9999.560000000001s)]
*  And, you know, like really proven because he had some big fucking misses. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10002.960000000001s)]
*  One of them was my film Battleship, which I'm proud of. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10008.52s)]
*  I love all my movies, but I kind of made him do that film. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10011.24s)]
*  And he was didn't quite work and he kind of had some other misses. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10014.68s)]
*  But he stayed true to himself and has built an incredible career. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10019.4s)]
*  And that's a guy who truly does like he used to live here. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10025.16s)]
*  And now this city got too big for him. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10029.56s)]
*  So now he's up and up way up in the crazy mountain, the crazy hills of Montana. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10031.6s)]
*  Just tracking wolves with cameras all day long. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10037.32s)]
*  Like I looked at some of your pictures in the lobby of the wolves. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10040.32s)]
*  Like he he sends me pictures all the time. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10043.32s)]
*  He's just so true to himself in that way. That's awesome. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10045.64s)]
*  But yeah, he plays a bad man. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10049.76s)]
*  He he plays it so well. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10051.64s)]
*  I think this is his best work ever. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10053.84s)]
*  I mean, he's been in a bunch of phenomenal projects, but this is this is his best. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10055.72s)]
*  It's so good, dude. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10061.039999999999s)]
*  I appreciate it. You should really be proud of it. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10062.84s)]
*  Thank you, man. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10064.88s)]
*  It's because it's it's not just really good. [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10065.88s)]
*  It's really good about a very unique time [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10068.48s)]
*  when you have this convergence of American, [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10071.68s)]
*  you know, this this emergence of these settlers trying to make their way [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10077.52s)]
*  across this country and dealing with the Indians. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10081.16s)]
*  And it's just is just phenomenal. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10085.439999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's it's a crazy time in human history and a very brief time. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10088.56s)]
*  If you really think about the impact that the West has had on American culture, [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10094.24s)]
*  we think about while West, every kid grew up playing cowboys and Indians. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10098.68s)]
*  Like this is a time that was a very short window. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10102.119999999999s)]
*  It was only a couple hundred years. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10106.16s)]
*  And it really changed the entire world [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10108.16s)]
*  because the the successful settling of this country by the Europeans [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10112.439999999999s)]
*  changed everything. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10116.6s)]
*  The establishment of America changed everything. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10117.92s)]
*  And the only way it was going to happen was you got to get through the the Indians. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10120.039999999999s)]
*  So we're doing the next one on. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10124.16s)]
*  This is a this is an announcement. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10126.960000000001s)]
*  The next American primeval is going to be on General Custer. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10130.64s)]
*  Yeah, man. And we're going to focus on [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10135.12s)]
*  a period, short period of time leading up to Little Big Horn and how when, [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10138.92s)]
*  you know, because he is a very misunderstood character from American history. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10142.960000000001s)]
*  And I'm sure you know a bit. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10147.2s)]
*  Are you a Custer fan? Yeah, yeah. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10150.04s)]
*  I mean, he was a fucking beast. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10151.68s)]
*  And he was a warrior in the Civil War who was leading in the front of the cavalry. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10155.08s)]
*  He started cavalry charges. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10159.56s)]
*  And I like to imagine being in a cavalry charge [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10161.72s)]
*  like like fucking five hundred guys on your side, five hundred of mine. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10165.48s)]
*  And we're just galloping full fucking speed at each other [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10169.64s)]
*  and just fucking smashing. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10173.6s)]
*  And he would just and he just kept doing it all through the Civil War [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10176.04s)]
*  and was just a badass. [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10179.6s)]
*  The war ends. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10181.880000000001s)]
*  And he's a warrior with like he starts losing his mind [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10183.160000000002s)]
*  because he doesn't know what to do with himself. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10185.720000000001s)]
*  So they send him out west to deal with the Indian problem. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10187.640000000001s)]
*  So have you thought about multiple versions of American primeval [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10190.84s)]
*  with different characters throughout history? [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10194.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So the goal would be to do [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10196.28s)]
*  like one of the things that was cool about American primeval [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10200.6s)]
*  and reactions, people like, whoa, I didn't know that about Brigham Young. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10203.04s)]
*  I didn't know this about Jim Bridger. I didn't understand. Right. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10206.84s)]
*  And so you get something that works. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10209.720000000001s)]
*  Hopefully, you know, entertaining, cool fucking show [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10211.960000000001s)]
*  that's just fucking awesome. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10215.32s)]
*  But you're also like, oh, wow, I'm fucking learn about the country. Right. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10217.28s)]
*  So you I like the idea of taking moments in American history, [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10221.12s)]
*  not necessarily all about the West, although Custer is something [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10225.56s)]
*  that Mark Smith and I are both kind of obsessed with. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10229.08s)]
*  And there's so much cool shit around the story of General Custer and Crazy Horse [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10231.88s)]
*  and building a fictional story around those characters. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10236.88s)]
*  And having some great actor play Custer is exciting. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10241.88s)]
*  But I could see doing the third one on something like the Attica prison riot, [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10245.08s)]
*  which has always obsessed me. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10250.4s)]
*  And if you followed that, there's an incredible book by Tom Wicker, [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10252.679999999998s)]
*  who was a journalist called A Time to Die that dissects that event [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10257.119999999999s)]
*  because I like events, you know, like I'm good with events. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10261.88s)]
*  If you give me a contained event over a short period of time [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10265.439999999999s)]
*  and I can tell that story and it's emotional and visceral, that that's [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10268.84s)]
*  an Attica was fucking wild and how it started and how it escalated [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10272.8s)]
*  and the players involved in the negotiating to try and calm it down [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10278.32s)]
*  and the corrupt governor Rockefeller who wouldn't negotiate [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10282.880000000001s)]
*  because they might be a peer weak. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10285.960000000001s)]
*  And then finally, it just goes off and everyone's dead. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10287.56s)]
*  And it was a great look at the American prison system, [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10291.880000000001s)]
*  racism, negotiations, religion, [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10296.48s)]
*  because the Black Panthers were in there and the Muslim Brotherhood was just. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10301.4s)]
*  So I like the idea of taking moments in American history [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10306.24s)]
*  that are probably pretty fucking violent and sort of presenting them [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10310.72s)]
*  and being like, wow, this is thrilling and deeply entertaining. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10314.72s)]
*  But I never knew that. [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10319.880000000001s)]
*  And this is like in with Attica. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10321.48s)]
*  Oh, this might get me to think a little bit about prison reform [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10323.16s)]
*  and the state of, you know, incarcerated American men [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10326.76s)]
*  in today in America, because that story of Attica is deeply [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10332.0s)]
*  rooted in like abusive prisoners all over America. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10337.2s)]
*  Have you done anything on that? No. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10341.76s)]
*  I mean, incarceration. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10345.44s)]
*  Well, I've done some shows with Josh Dubin, who used to work [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10346.88s)]
*  with the Innocent Project and now like Perlmutter, sir. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10350.6s)]
*  And, you know, because of the show, we've got a lot of people actually [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10354.0s)]
*  that were wrongfully accused, released. [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10357.48s)]
*  It's it's prison systems are fucking it's fucked. [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10360.68s)]
*  It's a fucking disaster. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10364.24s)]
*  I mean, look, you got going back to Ksenia, this girl who's now in a fucking [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10365.800000000001s)]
*  working prison camp in Siberia for like we have fucked up prisons. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10371.16s)]
*  Russia, South America, you imagine being in a Venezuelan prison right now. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10376.720000000001s)]
*  And so I like the idea in America has its own unique flavor [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10382.48s)]
*  of fucking hell within prisons. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10387.28s)]
*  Not to make light of prison, right. [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10391.720000000001s)]
*  And I'm not. But I actually had an idea a while ago for a show [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10394.24s)]
*  that I wanted to do like Survivor or or Fear Factor. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10398.6s)]
*  Take three guys, three, like take the three of us in this room right now. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10403.240000000002s)]
*  Three fucking tough, badass American men. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10407.480000000001s)]
*  All right. And put three. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10410.36s)]
*  Yeah, there's three of us in here. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10412.240000000002s)]
*  In my mind, you are. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10414.76s)]
*  That's what we're doing. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10416.52s)]
*  You're a fucking legend. [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10417.6s)]
*  You're a legend, Jamie. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10419.560000000001s)]
*  Fucking legend, Jamie. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10420.640000000001s)]
*  But you put each. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10422.84s)]
*  Man in a maximum security prison somewhere in the world, like the worst. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10425.36s)]
*  So you're in Thailand, Jamie's in Venezuela and I'm in Russia. [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10430.32s)]
*  OK. And you go in by yourself. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10434.039999999999s)]
*  All right. And you just are put in a general population. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10437.039999999999s)]
*  And the deal is you can get out any time you want. [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10440.64s)]
*  You just have to say the code word blue vase and the warden knows [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10444.16s)]
*  and the prison knows, but nobody is telling that nobody knows. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10448.16s)]
*  That everyone thinks you're a prisoner. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10451.84s)]
*  Whoever stays in the longest. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10453.48s)]
*  Gets 10 minutes. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10456.68s)]
*  And you have no idea when the other guys have gotten out. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10457.8s)]
*  Right. So like, all right. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10460.92s)]
*  You could stay in for five fucking years and me and Jamie got out in three minutes. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10463.039999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10467.599999999999s)]
*  But just like how you would survive prison and what a horror prison is today. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10469.039999999999s)]
*  And so that took me down a rabbit hole of I assume maybe doing it as a film. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10475.96s)]
*  But maybe a good Squid Games movie. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10479.96s)]
*  Yeah, like Squid Games. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10482.759999999998s)]
*  Did you do that? [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10483.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10484.759999999998s)]
*  Like a Squid Games movie. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10485.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like Squid Games. [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10486.800000000001s)]
*  Did you ever see the movie Brubaker with Robert Redford? [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10487.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10490.2s)]
*  Which true story about a warden of a new prison who went in undercover as a prisoner to, you know, to see what was going on. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10491.2s)]
*  But I think to do something like Attica, something like we're going to do Custer next. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10500.2s)]
*  But if you have any good ones, man, send them over. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmkaD9OqYE&t=10505.800000000001s)]
