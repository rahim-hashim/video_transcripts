*  matter
*  Well that one that I repeated in a podcast history
*  Well, we fucked that up. We thought we were recording we were saying how Burt is the only person we know who's both funny and
*  A great promoter like usually get one or the other you get someone who's really funny
*  But we're talking about Burt's we saw all this is being recorded. Oh, it's so much better
*  They got that audio is being recorded. Oh, I'm just that video so I can leave that in the mp3 everybody can download that beginning
*  Oh, okay
*  Everybody the audio we're gonna stop now. We're gonna double repeat ourselves
*  So a bunch of people Bert used to have a show called Bert hurt Bert and that one disturbed me the most
*  Cuz I don't remember this one at all Bert. He would do a bunch of stupid shit and get injured, but he's really getting hurt
*  He's doing jujitsu with some kid and some red belt kid who's with Hell's and grip or Horry and Gracie
*  Really that when he was that young he really reminds me that frat guy. Yeah, and he was I can't really see it now
*  But this is him like four years removed from that. This guy keeps arm bar and I mean he has no what to do here
*  108 pounds I think part of it. He's also going along with it enjoying he's got to take the offensive fuck that
*  Wow, this kid will never see it. He's played duck twice or possum twice
*  Video that I showed you that Bridgett Fetise showed me
*  It's a video of this guy who's on a school bus and
*  It's it starts with a bus driver throwing a little kid off the school bus screaming at him
*  And then a bunch of people like what the fuck are you doing man?
*  You can't chase him back onto the bus the bus driver gets back on the bus and then they check
*  No, are you okay? And they realize this little kid with like a lunchbox and everything is actually a grown midget
*  And he's pretending that he's a little kid hanging out with these little kids and the bus driver found it
*  Do the look at everybody's face with like when they say wait, he's not a kid and they're like, oh I was mad
*  So he's got the lunchbox. He throws out his lunchbox and he grabs them throws them. Yeah
*  It's crazy
*  Because he's got a little bit of a back. Okay, we're ready to beat his ass be the bus drivers ass
*  They saw him chuck off a little kid. Yeah, five-year-old body
*  People ready to call the cops. Yeah, and then they get to him to see hey you okay?
*  now watch this
*  They go
*  That's a grown-ass man, he's hurt dude was pretending to be everybody's confused look how confused they all are like
*  I don't I was mad before I don't know
*  What to think now that's crazy. Thanks. Look like they just saw David Blaine. That's crazy. Why did we bring that up?
*  Why were we talking about that? That's a great question. That's not a dude something to do with burp. I don't know what that was
*  What does it have to do with it's what I heard no no no no
*  Kid was beating up Bert and jujitsu. I don't remember
*  November yeah, this is a not sober November. No remember November
*  I definitely don't remember what the fuck we're talking about dude. You're uh, you're on an iPhone now. Tell me what that's been like
*  Okay, it's been pretty interesting. Yeah, so I've set myself in October to see if I could fucking do it again
*  You told me about that app that's on the thing. Mm-hmm
*  Limits your screen time. There was your screen time. Yeah, you have that for your kids. Yeah
*  Yeah, that's what I was looking for like five six years ago there was nothing it would just give you alarms and you can not
*  Because enough yeah
*  Yeah, you know, it's sort of like you remember when we had to do those 15 yoga classes
*  Uh-huh, you had to do it. So because you had to do it you just fucking knew you were gonna do it
*  The wishy-washyness was gone of what the wishy-washy is. I don't have to do this. I could back off
*  I'm kind of tired. Anyway, let me take the day off that all that shit was gone. You couldn't do that
*  Yeah, that's sort of the same thing with that app because you could always say I'm not gonna use my phone much
*  Fuck that does that mean dude? I'm an observer of the other people on our phones
*  Everyone who says that is on all the time. Yeah, it's so easy to be on and you could with me
*  I found myself just reading Google news stories for no reason
*  Yeah, just looking up and a lot of them aren't even like an interesting
*  It's like oh this car sold for this much money or oh, you know
*  Yeah wasting time wasting time time you're bored I'm lying to myself because I'm always thinking that I'm gonna oh but there's material in this
*  I'm gonna find a story. That's really funny. Yeah, but you those kind of you find out anyway
*  You know I'm saying like you people or force you a really good ones like the that guy getting thrown off of us
*  Yeah, how one's gonna get the way that thing would have got you, you know years before the internet
*  The horse one got to us well the internet was around but it was years before social media. What was your joke? I win
*  No, no, that's never in a special what yeah why
*  Comedy Central said it was too rough. It's pretty rough
*  Maybe I can revive it. Oh my god
*  Just the early days of the internet were like this. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it was a true story, too
*  Yeah, I did have a friend of mine that I go back and forth with he was so fucking
*  He was one of those dudes that just knows
*  Everything that's fucked up like he can find all the video the bud Dwyer video
*  you know he was one of those guys and he would send me this videos like batters up and
*  I would like batter up. What the fuck is this?
*  I open up the email and it's that porn star with a baseball bat upper ass Bella Donna. Yes, it was her
*  I was like Jesus Christ
*  And then you know and then I we would go back and forth. I would send him something fucked up
*  He would send me something fucked up
*  Baseball bat was surprising spattered nowhere batter up. I was like, what is this? I'm like, oh my god. How how
*  Poor girls asshole must be a wreck dude
*  Interesting fact about Bella Donna that first storytelling show we ever did at the improv 12 people were there and she was one of them
*  Oh, wow. Well, she used to go to the comic store. No, she was cool. Yeah
*  Yeah, it was crazy. They offered me some gaping porn. They had some DVDs. They were giving away. I'm like, I'm good man
*  Thanks guys, like why didn't you take it? I was like, hey man, it's not a disrespectful thing. It's just not my thing
*  I'm not into your art. Also. I'm afraid I'm gonna go down this line
*  this when like
*  Gaping porn is the weirdest shit ever because it's people want to look inside people's bodies
*  You want to look in the hole they want the hole to be gaping
*  Yeah, it's like a that's a style of porn and gaping and why the drip out you ever see the drip out at the end
*  Like why is this still recording and they shake the close-up? You know what I'm talking about
*  Close-up they close up vagina and wait for the jizz to come out. Yeah, I agree with that face. Yeah
*  It's not for me. I don't know why it's still on the video like it people like weird shit, right people like feet
*  They like they like everything and someone likes everything. What's really weird is a some things that some people would hate other people love
*  Mm-hmm
*  Yeah
*  With food to movies and shit like that
*  Intelligent well-respected woman
*  I won't break up her name was on stage talking about how she likes taking loads in the face
*  Now she might have been saying this as a joke, but it might have been true
*  Some people just like love it like some girls like that, right?
*  That's why it's or is it guys like it and that's why it's a thing or girls pretend they like it
*  So the guys do it but for some girls would be like fuck that get that away from me other people would love it
*  That's what's weird about humans. Yeah, right
*  There's so many people that are into such weird shit. I spit on vagina once you was whatever and
*  Didn't like it she was like just better my vagina
*  She was why didn't like that I'm like I was I won't do it again Wow
*  I don't know she goes all right, but a guy would get mad if a girl spit on his dick
*  I don't think no, they might be like, whoa
*  They're just shift away
*  Maybe if you were like having a really hard time staying hard anyway, because she's you know, she's intimidating you
*  You barely hanging in there and then she spits on your dick. You're like, hey, what the hell you might lose your boner
*  It was like real. Yeah a full gag her right away
*  Yeah, you're kissing and then she's is the next step and you're like, whoa slow down the fuck down
*  Was this type of foreign inevitable or like yeah, I never did the hustler stuff and never went through all the court cases would
*  Have happened in a hundred. Yeah, those Larry flint guys are important that they helped move the needle for sure. No doubt
*  I mean that guy took a bullet for the freedom of expression
*  Well, do you like porn or not? We've all jerked off to it. And if you say you didn't you're a hypocrite
*  I mean the way this liar not listening where you like cross the line that was that exists
*  Yes, he certainly did
*  But my point is I think that there was a there like they had already done deep throat before hustler, right?
*  Deep throat when was deep throat deep throat was a porn film that people went to see like a regular film
*  It was like a movie it was X same time wasn't it also a nickname like a code name for someone like yes
*  But that's like no no, that's post that's during Watergate
*  Well, that was one of the insiders in Watergate and their nickname was deep throat
*  But that was because the movie had already been out 70 they named one of the Nixon Watergate people
*  Was the person who was fun
*  Yeah, yeah for sure
*  Fucking look man those CIA people or whoever the fuck was involved with all that stuff SPF bi
*  Yeah, they're there a lot of them are bros. Yeah, do you think one guy?
*  Bros and the next guy's like oh really because I went to if someone was running for president I broke it
*  I fucking office dude, right? Yeah, what I'm sure I'm sure there's some of that some of that
*  There's there a lot of I mean, they're like cops. Yeah, like military people, you know
*  Like a lot of them are just men guys guys men. They probably watch porn
*  They probably know deep throat is you know if you're working for like one of the biggest police
*  I mean, it's essentially a police organization. None of them major in English with a focus on Shakespeare FBI's law enforcement
*  Jocks
*  Not not disrespecting it but that's why they would call it
*  Throat like it's a group group of women that are you know from
*  University of Massachusetts Amherst. Yeah, they call you fucking yarning
*  They're definitely not gonna call it deep throat. Yeah, that would be contributing to the patriarchy manic panic
*  But that movie was in 72. So when did hustler start hustler was around 75 76. Are you a fish in?
*  I remember
*  Remember like that said Larry Flint started in Columbus that first oh, that's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. Yeah, that's right
*  Yeah, man, I had to go to the hustler office once to review porn
*  There was like an article that they were doing where you review porn. It was so weird
*  it was like the weirdest thing they I forget is like early in the days the internet right like
*  More than 20 plus like trying to figure anything out. Yeah, they were just trying to figure things out and try things out
*  So you watch the porno over there?
*  I don't remember what it was. I think I was reviewing magazines. I was reviewing porn magazines
*  I'm trying to I think that was what it was or maybe they showed me a little of the porn or they showed me the magazine
*  I don't remember it was
*  Same time hustler started same year
*  Nixon ended 74. Mm-hmm first of the deep throat was 72. Yeah, so that's exactly where he came from
*  Yeah, you and Stan Hope
*  And Stan Hope's mom review boobs or something. Yes
*  Stan Hope's mom reviewed porn on the man show. That was it. Yeah, that's what it was
*  Stan Hope's mom would watch porn and give these fucking hilarious reviews of it
*  It was one of the best things we did it was really his mom was really funny, too
*  Really? She's like Hinchcliffe's mom. You seen Hinchcliffe's mom dude. She just had a clip mom did stand-up
*  He wrote the bits for and she did him. She had cue cards
*  She did it a kill Tony packed main room and fucking murdered. I'm telling you dude
*  She killed and one of she got me with a zinger. I forget what it was
*  It was fun. It was all shit that Tony wrote
*  It was funny shit man, and she did it with like authority like she hit the punchlines like he coached her really
*  Yeah, yeah, it was great. It was great
*  She never done anything like that before and here she murdered at her son's show and he brings her up as his mom
*  There it is right now. There's his mom
*  Okay, that's it. Yes. She's amazing. I'm telling you dude. She fucking murdered it. Look at him, dude
*  How dare you
*  How dare you she was really good man
*  Wow, that's cool. I don't want to play any of it because it's their stuff, but we people could see it
*  What's the video killed 25 year anniversary?
*  Episode 273 so was Dom I rara who's the best at those things? He's the best no one's better than Dom at those
*  roast shows
*  Talking shit or like something like kill Tony where a guy does it one minute of terrible comedy and he gets the chime in
*  He's just the master at dissecting people ironically have you ever seen him do is open my character. Oh, yeah
*  Oh, is it arrow razor?
*  Something like that. Oh, he does it so good. He's so nervous
*  If you interrupt me as to back up and start from the scratch from the beginning like over and over again
*  He's so good on kill Tony. He should be a regular. He really should he should be on every episode
*  He should be on every episode and then whoever the guest is on top of it. He's just so good
*  He's just so good at talking shit to people when they do terrible things and do it in a way
*  We can't even be mad at him
*  We use it were you watching last night's new episode of kill Tony no, I didn't see it
*  Why you have to watch it when it comes out like Ari was on yesterday. Oh, was it good?
*  You got a standing ovation. I think I don't know you that's what I do. I get standing owes Wow, dude. You're an animal. I
*  Just came on that good. Oh you came on naked from behind
*  How's that work for you to they have to blur out your cock and balls?
*  I don't know. It's something they should deal with I'm just there for the live show should be they should have like a little a little
*  Like a button you can put a little blurry thing that bounce around your cock
*  Why doesn't YouTube come on? I say a setting at this point on the YouTube just if you see a cock blurred out
*  Did you see the new release that said something and maybe this is people freaking out for no reason?
*  Maybe it's not skipped over what people are freaking out about some new
*  Terms that they have where they can get rid of any channel that they don't think is commercially viable
*  Is that the quote they did update their terms of service, but I don't I haven't looked into this
*  I'm just going off of what I think I don't know that that's like new in the terms
*  I think I've already been able to do that Facebook can delete your thing. I think Twitter can delete your account
*  I think that's kind of an all of them
*  So they always have the ability to tell you to fuck off you can't delete your own account, but they can delete yours
*  I mean come on dude. They run the fucking world
*  Well Facebook they're bigger than the government Facebook's a giant. Yeah, they're not national. They'll go anywhere. They're bigger than the government. They're giant
*  You don't freak me out
*  Zuckerberg on TV in China
*  I think you speak in Mandarin. I was so impressed. I was like look at this fucking guy. How smart is he?
*  Yeah, you went to the same school AOC went to I mean that's
*  That's beside the point yeah, yeah
*  What's he doing a lot of people went to that school? They can't do it. I know speaking Mandarin is that's hard
*  You know if you're learning that as an adult. Holy shit, and he does it on a talk show and people are laughing
*  It's really funny man, so he's on this show and the guy's speaking to I think it's Mandarin what?
*  Yeah, no, he's didn't understand it
*  Tells a story to the crowd and they're laughing so he told a joke
*  He told a joke in Chinese, so you know it already he knew how to talk in Chinese from college learned
*  No, I think I think his wife is Chinese so he learned, you know either with
*  Because I was a show to that movie. Hmm, so I think he's he's just one of those dudes
*  It's just a little too smart for his own good
*  He's running Facebook. They're trying to fucking
*  Every chance they go of course they are they definitely are but it's just the influence that one person can have
*  When you are a kid who starts up a social network
*  You think you're just gonna connect people that want to like say hi to friends from school
*  Yeah, you try to start making some cash and then next thing, you know
*  People are using it to shift democracies and then people are putting filters in there to try to control the content and then people are
*  biased against certain political ideologies and more submissive or
*  More permissive of others and then it becomes really weird like wait, is this a free speech zone?
*  Like what is this? Is this like you decide who are you?
*  Who are these people that get to decide are they deciding only for money?
*  Like how did you engineer this you wait a minute you engine you didn't engineer it specifically to create conflict
*  But it's more monetarily beneficial for you to create conflict and your algorithm is sort of
*  Conflict it's it's sort of gravitates towards conflict
*  right like if you're if you engage with things a lot of people like say if it's a if it's a topic that is a
*  Very red hot mad get you a mad abortion, right?
*  Of course if you engage with abortion threads, you're fucking your feed will be filled with those things. Oh, yeah
*  That's what you're fine. Yeah, and then keep coming back. What? Yeah, it's
*  my comment
*  But if here's my question if you're a person that instead engages with only positive stuff
*  Would that make your your your I mean is it just what you're engaging in?
*  Yeah, so I did this as a test to myself whatever on YouTube to see how much YouTube was influencing me
*  You know with that algorithm you've looked at fucking one video go down a hole
*  So yeah, you go down a hole Tim pool kept coming up for fucking you know, five months after that
*  After that podcast you did and then it was like
*  So I was like from now on for a month. I'm only clicking on puppy videos
*  I'm searching puppy videos when I see one like of yours or if somebody's that I want to see or music something that pops up
*  Before I'm like, nope, not touching it only searching and clicking on YouTube videos
*  Puppies sometimes they gave me dogs, but it was just more and more that shit soldiers coming home
*  When the dogs greeting them and then eventually just start hitting me with only fucking puppy videos
*  So that the algorithm just recognizes what you're interested in. Yeah, so you can't blame people then no
*  But sometimes it makes you think this way it makes you get mad about something ever talk to someone who's like woke about something
*  And you want to be like I don't really believe you
*  I don't believe you're this mad about this thing like somebody made you this mad
*  It doesn't doesn't quite make sense, you know
*  And so then it's like I think they've been influenced to think a certain way by these dumb algorithms
*  So it's kind of fun to be upset about things too
*  One of the things about like being into anything left-wing or right-wing stuff is like when you get into it
*  It's fun. Yeah other people are into it's fun too when when you got action shits happening you yelling at each other
*  You know you're going to that fucking Facebook every day
*  What the fuck these assholes have to say about the First Amendment today, right? You know you want to get what is it?
*  Yeah
*  But you proved at least on YouTube that if you just gravitate towards positive things like most of my YouTube feed is like MMA fights
*  And pool matches I watch a lot of pool pro pool like my my end muscle cars
*  My my YouTube feed is pretty it's it's pretty much what I look for. I don't look for a lot shit
*  I looked to YouTube for fun only
*  Does still hit you with shit that you're like, what is this about?
*  Yeah, occasionally they sneak some gossipy stuff in there some celebrity stuff in there
*  You know weird weird ones get in that don't seem to make sense. Yeah, I understand why but I don't use Facebook
*  So that's the most evil one. Yeah, I use it in a sense that it's connected to my Instagram, but I don't actually use it
*  I don't get in there. I don't read it. I don't
*  There's a little controversy this week that Instagram's gonna take the likes away from yeah, I heard about that
*  Yeah, it's gonna take the lights away from like
*  To minimize you can't see how many likes you got for a post. How many views?
*  You can see it all but the I can't see how many likes you got
*  So if you put up a picture and your picture got forty thousand likes I can never see that Wow
*  So they can still make their money off it but everyone else won't get to a contest of like
*  Speculation is that it's going to drive advertising dollars into giving money directly to Instagram instead of people being able to
*  Those fucks
*  Those fall not that's really what but if you were an Instagram, right and you had people making shit
*  Tons of money off your platform just by posting things. Hey, this is my new butt cream or whatever the fuck you're selling
*  Yeah, and they don't even get a piece of that. They got to be like, hey, what are we doing?
*  we're spending a million dollars a month and fucking bandwidth probably way more than that actually and
*  Way more than that they have videos and shit too. You could upload videos. It's got to be millions in bandwidth for every month and
*  They're not getting none of that. I
*  Get it. People go there. They get the mind other ads
*  It's they still monetize them, but you'll be able to show like if you if you have you know
*  If you have a screenshot of your phone and do that
*  I also think that it's gonna de incentivize people to like photos exactly because you don't see you're making a difference, right?
*  Who's made more money than those but doctors because of Instagram?
*  like if you look like the percentage of like
*  Uptick in revenue. Yeah, like but doctors like guys who just specialize in
*  Better that's Instagram made them they put them on the map. Yeah, these dudes out there with but they were going broke
*  They were having to do pop
*  And that's suddenly
*  Dude, you know, there's a theory that that I think is true that
*  Women are just hotter these days because they're always on the verge of being on Instagram
*  So even to go to the supermarket to put makeup on they're putting nice nice clothes on
*  They're always looking their best because they went to a friend. They might get uploaded
*  This is a tough time to be frumpy. Yeah, you know if you're a gal, there's a lot of competition out there
*  And there's a lot of a lot of these hoes go for it. Okay, they don't they go for it
*  They're pulling their panties aside and at 38% of their pictures, you know
*  I mean, there's a lot a lot of like strong competition out there now
*  They're changing the bar and this is by the way for sure
*  One of the reasons why prostitution is illegal why one of the reasons why prostitution is illegal
*  It would completely flip relationships on its head
*  If guys didn't need to have a relationship to have sex just sex and relationships were only love
*  So you can go no get sex from a woman for money
*  Just like you get a handjob or just like you can get a massage rather you can get a handjob
*  Yeah, I give you why can how can they give massage? Well, they can't massage your dick. Yeah
*  Well, if they did if they could there would be so
*  People would change what they want out of a relationship. Yeah, it would be different you would you would there would be it would be way like
*  Any women are not saying that all women are like this but any woman any woman that is sexually manipulative
*  We're like she won't she withhold sex from a man if he doesn't do certain things that goes away that goes away
*  Do that people my friends in Bangkok when I met people in Bangkok
*  They were like they don't play those the regular women here the non working woman, right?
*  They don't play the game right because they know doesn't exist. I could just walk down the street, right?
*  Like a bodega in New York, they're everywhere and just find a woman. Yeah, so this like I'll make him wait
*  It's like shut up with that. Yeah, you're interested just go for it. The problem is shame for the girl
*  That's the fucking problem
*  If there's no shame for the girl
*  If you didn't if no one really cared if she hooked up with you on a one-night stand
*  It turns out she fucked your cousin a month ago. No one cared. That's almost gone. It's almost gone. Yeah, it is almost gone, right?
*  It's changing. Yeah
*  Conversations people didn't talk about this shit and we were kids you had to figure it out on your own
*  It's so casual now dude nobody taught you about jerking off nobody taught you about drinking
*  No, nobody taught you what to do in a relationship
*  Those are the three most confusing fucking things you're just guessing
*  Yeah guessing gonna make a PSA real quick for the children who are gonna start drinking your parents are never gonna teach you about alcohol use
*  There's a thing called coasting when you have a few drinks
*  You can switch to water if you're feeling drunk
*  You're gonna throw up if you keep drinking like a child, but you're a child, right?
*  So you don't get how to do it yet. You got a coast one water one beer one water one beer
*  Great time don't have too many don't have if you're gonna drink and I don't advise anyone under 21 to drink because that's illegal
*  But if I was gonna advise them, I would say have two drinks. Don't have more than two two will fuck you up, man
*  Okay, I'm gonna take don't be that guy. You're for sure gonna get drunk, but yeah
*  If you're 16 years old, maybe 16
*  Daniels will put you in a fucking a goofy mood. I would say wherever you're at if you're feeling good
*  Just stop for a while stop for a while. It's hard right there
*  You still got more going down to problem is you lose your inhibitions, right?
*  They go out the window and then you're having fun. You want to have more fun
*  You got bird on the table he's got his butt crack you're underneath that he's pouring asshole shots
*  Because you can have two or three of those in four minutes and get blasted
*  What happened your mainlining alcohol right to the old hatch one shot you feel it like like instantly like whoa
*  You're ready to throw up. You still got two more shots that haven't hit you yet. Oh
*  You know what else is up our chief here's gonna be with me at the improv tonight at 1030 sold out show fuckers

*  Yeah, yeah, try to find a venue. I want I was it's a lot about Judaism my upbringing, you know
*  I can do that comedy club funny be done with that shit. Yeah, you know, so that's what I've been working on for a while
*  Yeah, it's been a couple of years, right?
*  Yeah, it's been a couple of years, right?
*  Longest one two and a half years. Mm-hmm
*  But it's also the first one that you did like a theme and it's essentially so what you did was like
*  There's a lot of guys who do that. I've never been to Edinburgh, but that festival is like that's how it is, right?
*  Oh my god, and it's like a lot of people who do themes. Yeah, yeah come in
*  So you decided to do a theme but to do this theme with American style stand-up. Yeah, that's exactly it, dude
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, the fur I went two years
*  I went with my storytelling show one year and then I was like my plan was to go show them what a fucking American hour was
*  Which is my last special just like hey, here's your stand-up you fucking fools
*  Trying to do some fucking hot higher thing where you're like tying it all together, but they're not funny, right?
*  They do like 20 minutes of unfunny. And so I was like everybody here
*  I'm giving you an American hour and it was just that and then the next year the plan was and it became two years later
*  Was like now I'll do one of your stupid fucking theme hours
*  But I'm not gonna do it where I'm just fucking serious for 20 minutes. It's ridiculous. Is that what they do?
*  They really do and I don't get it. I don't get why you have to I get the theme
*  I don't get why you have to stop being funny. Did you see it's all theater shit. Did you see Hannah Gatsby?
*  I didn't see her live. She was the year I was off and that yeah, I thought that was her name
*  I thought her name
*  You didn't see it I didn't see it live the people I know saw live was like in the room they're like damn
*  It was like pretty powerful because that shit goes at Edinburgh to people see four or five shows a day for five days in a row
*  And she's so but her thing a lot of is not funny. Some of it's funny, but a lot of funny. Yes
*  she was in England of the not funny part that was like
*  Legit powerful stuff where you're like fuck you're caught up in the emotion
*  But a lot of them is just forcing in and I've seen people doing my storyteller
*  She like forcing in some like lesson or something. It's like dude. It's not there. It's okay
*  You just have a fun story right right right right forcing in lessons is gross
*  Yeah, I always like the moth which I'd like them off but like there was the moth. I'm off. There's a storytelling series
*  Mikey D did one on there about about maybe about getting AIDS. Oh like the Stefano
*  And about his aunt or something, but usually it was like comics did it was just funny
*  And then when normals did it they were like they would have something they'd be like
*  That's not just the day. I lost my watch. That's the day. I lost my innocence
*  They just got over dramatic yeah, and that's what they do in Edinburgh a lot
*  Some of them are really good right but that theme thing was that and I was like I want to do that better when you say
*  American style stand-up. I almost wish I wasn't an American stand-up so I could fucking wholeheartedly agree with you
*  It's but I wish I wasn't an actual American stand-up so I could have
*  Oh, that'd be way better on opinionated point in this because when I hear people say you like America's not where the best stand-ups
*  Are like you're out of your mind
*  It's fine. They're doing great. They started behind us
*  I'm sure a lot of you are out there in New Zealand and Florida and other countries Florida's not America
*  Australia anywhere you're at
*  There's some of your genius and some of you are amongst the best in the world doesn't disqualify you for being amongst the best in
*  World but if you want to say that there's not a greater number of hilarious fucks
*  Female and male in America a way
*  Disproportionate number you're out of your fucking mind the greatest ones are here. You're out of your mind. It's not even close
*  It's not even it's there's no race. Yeah, it's
*  Starter yeah, right exactly. There's a lot of great comics other places, but overall
*  They're just like behind us take us completely out of the equation take our friends out of the equation
*  Yeah, this place is filled with assassins
*  I
*  Built on fucking rebels well, especially now with the internet
*  I mean you can become a legit national act with no one's help like Andrew like Schultz is doing yeah
*  He is doing everything everything through YouTube. He's selling out theaters. He's murdering it. You don't need anybody anymore
*  Yeah, these fucking killers like him all these assassins
*  He's turned the corner to people talk about it and like not about draw but just about like this material on stage
*  He's working at it. It's a funny fuck me. He's a smart dude, but the thing is like these guys they're they're blossoming now
*  There's a bunch of them and they're all over the place. Yeah. Yeah, it's a
*  Fucking it's a great time to be a comic. It really is
*  It really is the people get so worked up to which is also fun
*  I'm over all people definitely get more mad than they ever have before but they also get happier that you're willing to push the envelope
*  Oh, yeah, cuz it's a little bit of danger again. We talked about this. It's fucking dangerous again. It's great
*  Yeah, you said that to me on the phone once I'll never forget that I was driving home
*  You say the wrong thing like I think I can go a little darker and they're like nope you're done
*  We'll never be written off to each other exactly
*  But that's the reason why we can kind of we have freedom that maybe people in for T for sure TV shows don't have
*  Oh, yeah, they don't have any freedom. They don't have any freedom. Well, not but also right
*  They can take away a level of money we can make but like they can't take away the ability to do stand-up
*  No, unless every club says we won't book you or even the workout clubs won't have you guys
*  You just still do stand-up, right? Which is like the main thing. Yes. Yes, and you just have a few clubs
*  That'll be like you're we'll never gonna fucking get rid of him for anything. He says but yeah
*  And also the fans like if you did something, I mean it would have to be some horrible shit. That's real life shit
*  Yeah, you'd have to murder somebody. Yeah. Yeah
*  Do you think OJ could do stand-up?
*  for sure. Oh
*  My god, how do we make that happen?
*  He's actually charismatic I
*  Think he's friends with norm
*  Yeah, I think norm McDonald maybe I shouldn't say friends like norm knows him
*  And I think norm has actually talked to him about doing his part really. Yes
*  Do you know epic that would be that would be crazy?
*  I want to show you something the Stan wrote a long time ago now that we're talking about this if norm had if norm
*  Coached him OJ Simpson on his podcast. Hey juice
*  It's norm has this norm has
*  Whatever the fuck the opposite of having a filter is it's not having no filter. He's just got like like
*  Weird crazy shit's gonna come out of his mouth. He doesn't give a fuck. Did you see the did you see the
*  Sasha Baron Cohen with OJ? No, I did not
*  Oh, you gotta watch it. Yeah, if you're so sure. Yeah, I know I know I didn't see it the best
*  And he just this Italian guy and he's like
*  You gotta watch but he's like, yeah. Yeah. No, it's it has some assistant women, you know
*  I wish I could kill them but I guess I cannot and the guys like oh, just like I'm and I don't know
*  Oh, he gets him. Oh, he's just so convincing. He's so ballsy
*  Yeah to be able to do that shit in front of right in front of those people. They don't even know what's happening
*  Yeah, and they've signed up. Yeah here read this
*  This is what I mean by like they can't ever take it all away from us because you have clubs like this the stand
*  This is when I got one of my e-rages
*  Everyone call on the stand posting hateful messages and emailing hate speech to us
*  We never respond to such irresponsible protest despite what you feel about Ari Shafir
*  We have the right to book or hire anyone regardless of their views on religion race or politics
*  Ari is a comedian a performer just because you view his creations as something that is not humorous, but hate speech
*  That is your opinion harassing our establishment will not deter us from booking Ari to perform at the stand
*  please refrain from engaging our staff furthermore
*  unorganized protest over a
*  Over a something that is out of our control. Okay is not only morally wrong
*  But is viewed as a crime we will find out what special interest group
*  This is and press charges if this continues that is all damn
*  That's a public post that's what everyone else is backing down is like well, it's a tough time right now
*  You'll always have a few clubs like that. They're like get the fuck away. Yeah, we're not doing that
*  So you'll always have a place to thank God. Thank God
*  Yeah, yeah, thank Odin praise Zeus. Yeah. Yeah, I mean we need them. We need people like the store
*  We need many places that
*  You know in some clubs they used to recognize that they used to admits you would do this. They used to like write
*  Like full letters about Paul Mooney complaining about him and
*  We're like, what do you do?
*  And she was like call Paul read it to him and then decide if he wants the letter or not
*  Tell the people who complained that he's going to be severely punished
*  We would call Paul we just laugh about it goes read again read again
*  I love this and we read it back because you want to save for my day. Yeah
*  And then and then we call the person would be like, okay, he's been docked for two weeks. He won't be here
*  Here's four free tickets to the Comedy Store
*  Hopefully they'd be there when he was there again
*  And of course, he was never told not to show up. Oh my god, but like they were idiots back then too. It's hilarious
*  Always. Yeah, there's always people never gonna bow down
*  You know what?
*  I love looking at yelp reviews when I find someone that's like a one star for a restaurant that I know is good
*  I'm glad one star and then I'll read the review Mike. Let me check out this dude's profile
*  It's full of hate
*  Oh my god, he hates everything
*  Everything sucks every waiter is rude every fucking food is cold. It's more like the off-white house wash it
*  Some people are just twats. Yeah, they're just you know, did you see that New York Times review? They gave
*  The fucking Brooklyn steakhouse that we love what the hell's it called Peter Lugar's they gave Peter Lugar's one star one star
*  That member we just went there. Yeah, it was great was fucking amazing. Oh my god
*  Dude those potatoes they gave it one star
*  Three stars and you're like, maybe something happened. I don't know
*  It's smart because look if you're a provocateur slash journalist and I know how much you love trolls. Yeah
*  That's what that guy did. He took like one of the most delicious restaurants of all time and he made a one-star rating
*  It's either that or he's a moron
*  So either he's really clever or he's he's got to be a twat up on top of Google when you search Peter Lugar review
*  Now it sputters I can't start I count on Peter Lugar steakhouse in Brooklyn to produce certain sensations and then I don't know
*  Well, it's a very very popular restaurant, right? There's a giant waiting list last time we were there
*  We luckily weaseled in and had a grease and palms, but it's a fucking sweet spot
*  He and Diaz went when Diaz was in town. He was like get a reservation like getting like you're out of your mind
*  You can't get one. And so we had my manager assistant call and say we're part of Obama's staff
*  Oh
*  Yeah, they said we could do 315 and that's it. Oh my god. Yeah
*  Yeah, that's hilarious
*  Larry the foods there is fucking amazing that it's doing that for a one-star restaurant you can't not one star. That's a troll
*  You're absolutely right. That's that's more than he's not just he's just trying to get out of us
*  He's one of those writers. There's certain writers that are just trying to be assholes with everything they do
*  They love being assholes they love accentuating you live the art form of being an asshole an art form of being an
*  Articulate asshole you're an asshole with good
*  Do you know how to say the you know put the right words in the right order?
*  What just sounds juicy and pops and makes you seem?
*  terrible
*  But when you're doing that over something like Peter Lugar's like you lose that all that one star means
*  That's not what one star means. No what one star means
*  You go to the Olive Garden and the fucking guy works behind the counter has heroin
*  Actually zero stars zero. They didn't give it a one is a zero star. That's like I haven't even there's no zero
*  One is the lowest
*  Come on, what that's a Photoshop
*  Really? No, you can't do zero stars. It's a Photoshop. It's a troll. It's more showing that this guy's trolling and he would look we're talking about
*  It's great. He's a smart guy. Let's uncover him though. We uncovered him
*  Look like I took some work
*  If you want to make a fucking splash in the restaurant review business in 2019, that's what you do
*  Yeah, you can't go positive with shitty places. That won't work. No with great place negative
*  You know how you all love this. Well, I hate it. I shit in your mouth
*  Yeah, I mean he was talking about the the steak not being flavorful your
*  Talking about fucking my they dropped it on the floor and picked it up on the way. It's still a two-star. He's
*  He's bullshitting and they're all buying it hook line. We're like a bass right now like this. Yeah, absolutely got us
*  He got us hooking the jaw
*  I'm fighting against the drag
*  It's so much more fun to be angry. It's like well, let me finish telling my special. Oh, you're special. Okay
*  so
*  Since it was this whatever this theme thing. I was like we should do it in a synagogue
*  there's this place that I was like this works because it's like a
*  Like a performance space that was a synagogue and then they didn't want me to do it because my material
*  And then we kept trying to find new synagogues
*  That would let me do it
*  The one that would be good for performance and then also that would let me do it and they were all like no fucking way
*  Yeah, something like you have Holocaust jokes. I'm like, yes
*  And they're like no
*  My dad to survive I can see what do the fuck I want
*  Yeah, or do I have to be one no, I think you can say whatever the fuck you want
*  I say in front of him your dad is a fucking Holocaust survivor
*  This is a real thing. You know, I mean the Holocaust was a real thing. It's not a deal with it as a people
*  What yeah, that's that's the thing. It's like that's one of the rare things where only Jews can talk about it in that way
*  I mean anybody can talk about anything right but only Jews can talk about the Holocaust from a position of hey
*  That was my family that was killed that was my dad who was in the fucking concentration camp
*  Yeah, you can give some seriousness to you
*  Only people that can say that that that is my family or the people that were the only people
*  So if anybody the Armenians got fully wiped out dude the I mean
*  There's plenty of them
*  But I
*  Not only did the Armenians have a genocide but there was a denial of their genocide like a serious denial of their genocide
*  More than the Jew ones. Yeah. Yeah, like open and recent
*  Well, it's not that not that long ago people were still denying the Armenian genocide
*  Yeah, it's so that's a very touchy one with that man. I didn't know about until many Gamburian
*  Told me about it. Yeah, they hate the Turks
*  Well, they hate the people who massacred their ancestors they also just say the Turks we think so
*  Yeah at this point, they're probably not delineating. Isn't it weird it like fuck all? Yeah, it's turkey not Turkey to them
*  Is that one of them countries like Japan is Nippon, right? We're like, man. Don't like it Japan
*  There's a few countries. I think Greece is not Greece. I don't believe they call it Greece Israel Israel
*  It's close enough, yeah, it's close enough Greece is not Greece. I don't believe Greece is Greece
*  Or close. Yeah, that's close enough. But what is the Iceland's probably not Iceland? They have a whole different language
*  Maybe right? Yeah, what is Iceland? But what is what is Greece in their language? What's the what's the word? I
*  Might have made that up. Let's see if I made that up. We'll see. Well, I'm my brain is falling apart lately
*  Anyway, my special is February
*  February a hard question to Google is it why well, what is Greece called in Greece? Like it's not a Greek I know
*  But like it's not that's not that okay. What's the hard question?
*  What is the real name of the country Greece?
*  Okay
*  That's right. Turkey thing and it's too close to Thanksgiving. Oh
*  Turn off your safety. Um turn on your hotline
*  What is
*  What is the country Greece
*  What is the real name of the country Greece
*  The real name of the country Greece. What is it?
*  The ancient or modern name of the country is Hellas or hellada. How about it?
*  The way to name is the Hellenic Republic Wow, that's better
*  Then cover stuff. It's not something you put on an axle. It's not something you mix up with dancing. Yeah, Greece is the word
*  That's better Hellenic Republic
*  Probably yeah, so so that's one we fucked that one up. I'm pretty sure we fucked up Turkey. I don't think they call Turkey Turkey
*  Germany is Dutch land, right? There's one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he adopted it
*  They adopted its official name known as known in English as the Republic of I bet the butter industry bribed him
*  There's probably some cross-promotion with Kellogg's that's hilarious
*  I
*  Remember what guys think I'm at an leg fucking real mad at them. Yeah real mad at them furious. He was making so much
*  I'm very happy or do that Borat movies one of my favorite movies ever. That was one of the best one of the best comedy
*  Oh good. It's so good up there
*  It's so funny so good you go back and watch it today and you're like what in the fuck man
*  I've been seeing a while and again that guy he's just so good at fucking with people
*  He's so good at keeping a straight face
*  While all this madness is going on like remember when he shit in the bag and was handing it to one of the people in
*  The house in Georgia. Do you remember that?
*  Oh my god
*  You know, he fell asleep in that house in George's like a plantation house
*  He's trying to get real racist around them and then he fell asleep because they were drinking wine
*  There was like a wine plantation. He fell asleep and what they were like, he's gonna wake up
*  He's not gonna know what characters in like my god and then it's I didn't know what to do
*  But then he woke up and he was just like right into it Wow like saw where he was like, hmm
*  So he oh my god, that's hilarious. Yeah got blasted woke up drunk still realized he was Borat
*  Yeah, that's funny man him with Donald Trump back in the day when he was olly G
*  Did you ever see the olly J?
*  You ever see the olly G movie? He made a movie that was only available in the UK
*  I actually bought a special VHS player just to play it really yeah
*  Because it was one of those ones that was they used to be two two formats
*  No VHS used to be two formats of VHS
*  There was a format that they used over in the UK and there was a format that we use here and they're not
*  Compatible and you have to get either get like a universal player one that plays all formats or you had to get a separate one
*  So I went and got one that plays both but I got it specifically
*  The olly G TV shows to it used to be able to buy the TV shows online yeah, yes
*  Oh, those are great ones from England. Yeah, dude. I'm telling you man. This fucking voice great. Yeah, it's so silly
*  Especially if you're high, it's really funny. It's really fun. And I heard people tell me it's terrible
*  I'm like dude, I don't talk to me. I fucking laughed entirely through this movie
*  It's if you're if you're a stoner, this is an outstanding movie. What is it called olly G in the house?
*  It's from 2002 dude. It's so good
*  It's a lost gem. It's one of those at the dude from the office
*  I don't remember the dude that was with him the white guy
*  Yeah, maybe I don't remember in the British office. Yeah, I think it was a hitchhiker's guy either way
*  Yeah, Sam, all right, I'll look in it's fucking great. It's fucking great. It's really funny, man
*  Really funny
*  There's a dog licking his balls is ridiculous fun. You ever see Tom Green's shitty off amazing movie. Yes
*  Freddie got fingered. Yeah. Oh god, that was funny. There's some funny moments in that movie
*  Call that the worst there was another one started
*  I call that the worst movie of all time and then you finally watch it you're like this is
*  Shit, yeah, I mean shit. So like real laughs. That's another one. If you watch it today, you'd be laughing hard
*  Yeah, especially if you're a stoner there when the baby was in the umbilical cord
*  He like lands with his house in like the desert somewhere
*  It's like it's kind of sure to be over and it's like he's still going and then everyone's greeting him him and his dad
*  Like ripped torn or something the greeting one of the sign says why is this movie still going?
*  His whole fucking show is crazy that show is amazing that was an amazing show damn
*  Yeah, it was the best it was like I you'd never seen anything like that Jackass. He took time. God damn
*  Yeah, there's a lot of people taking serious risks on TV back then yeah
*  You know, yeah, how about um, what's his face? Um
*  The fucking
*  Damn it the X experience. What is his name that does the fucking?
*  the guy who would do the
*  People and put makeup on and shit get there Jamie Kennedy experiments. Jesus Christ
*  Not getting Jamie Kennedy out of my mouth
*  Weed my tolerance that whole my tolerance is through the fucking floor. Yeah, I have nothing
*  I was smart this time. I went into a going like give me some like 14%
*  This is for whatever for that goddamn Kevin Smith shit. He gets obliterated all day
*  Jamie Kennedy had a great show. Yeah, that Jamie Kennedy experience experiment. Is that what it was experiment? Yeah, that was a great fucking show
*  He had some whole lit. How about the ones when we talked those guys?
*  To being gay Chippendales dancers number
*  Remember like that one it was guys gone nuts
*  Yeah, it was like he was a sleazy producer and he was telling these guys that they were gonna be in this new show called
*  guys gone nuts and
*  Then eventually it got further down the line
*  He made him dance and stuff
*  But then eventually got further down the line where they were gonna have to do gay stuff and they were like he was getting them on
*  Saying how much gay stuff they'd be willing to do
*  It was legitimately ridiculous and he's this sleazy promoter treating them like they're you know
*  male prostitutes
*  It's very funny. It was very funny. It's another one. That's real. These are not acting. You're already got Holtzman to wipe his feet
*  No, I don't
*  King or Saudi Prince
*  Somebody got
*  Also an actor for no no no
*  Also, no idea this was happening. Yeah, he wiped the guy's feet because he thought that was like in my country
*  You're supposed to wipe some of his feet and he had holes open mics with him. Oh my god
*  So Holtzman didn't know yeah, just full makeup the accent the makeups amazing and then he's wiping his feet and then he's just like
*  Wow
*  Those guys who put that crazy latex shit on your face when they can give you a fake nose and fake cheeks like you can't tell
*  You can't tell especially not someone with vision problems. Yeah, I'm looking for it
*  Yeah, you ever hear of Jim Carrey after man of the moon
*  No, he got those people that did the makeup for him to look like Andy Kaufman and Zemuda, right?
*  Tony Clifton, right? Yeah. Yeah, he got them to make him up as whatever and that the rumor is that I heard so obviously
*  I have no idea
*  I love put us put him up in just makeup
*  Then he drove a cab around and drove fares around just so we could hear what people actually say him when they don't know it's
*  Jim Carrey in the room. Oh
*  Wow, yeah
*  Yeah, I can see when you become someone like Jim Carrey. It's gotta be weird as fuck
*  He probably wanted to go on vacation with a fake face. Yeah. Yeah
*  If it was really easy to do it didn't take hours to apply. Yeah, you probably want to do that just to see everybody treats you
*  Just be normal. Yeah, it's great. What a good idea, especially for that big. He can't go anywhere in the world
*  Well, he's also now he's become some new thing, right? It's like a delic. Yeah, he's not really an
*  actor anymore he paints and talks about things and
*  He's into psychedelics way in like everything he talks about is like he doesn't mention the psychedelics
*  He's still in stuff. He's in that is Sonic the Hedgehog movie. Yeah, I think he's still doing stuff TV show recently, too
*  What is it Sonic the Hedgehog Z your voice is always a bad guy
*  No, it's a human. Yeah. Oh, so it's a live movie. Yeah, I got a big controversy, but trailers came up today
*  That's why I was and he was on a TV show like a year ago nerds mad. That's a movie. They were mad
*  Yeah, of course. They can't be happy that they're making Sonic into a movie and getting Jim Carrey one of the biggest actors in the world
*  They're taking it seriously
*  Yeah, okay. When when would the nerds be okay when they hear movies coming out?
*  Okay with anything Batman the first Batman with Michael Keaton they were I don't
*  Be when there was one of the biggest controversy I ever heard about a role was when they were gonna have Tom Cruise play
*  In interview with the vampire really? Yeah when he was the lead he was Lestat
*  Why cuz and rice and rice did not want Tom Cruise to play Lestat
*  This is like this super intense character and these excellent books you ever read those books. They're very good
*  And
*  She you know had this vision for what her vampire
*  King character was like that what she won the vampire she wanted someone who was just more depth and intelligence
*  And just someone who had more layers and she felt like Tom Cruise is like Top Gun
*  You know, I mean, yeah, he's like color money, but that little crazy fucking act his ass off
*  Who is that he can act his fucking ass off and he he was really good in that movie
*  He fucking nailed it like when he's like an angry vampire in that movie he's yelling at that little girl you like holy shit
*  Like I'm buying this madness. He was excellent. He's good for a long time. Oh, he's good
*  He's fucking great. He's crazy as fuck, but he's great. Yeah, he's gotta be
*  You know what? It's a sinker sinker with the fucking sci-fi. Yeah, but
*  But his that's what it is. Yeah, but his acting is fucking still
*  He can go for it man. He knows um, those side was that edge of tomorrow
*  There was
*  Over and over again people already given up on for the movie or two before and then that movie came out
*  Nobody saw it, but it was so fucking good. So good. That movie is so good
*  And every one of the most underrated side of the same day over and over again and every time I'd be like no cuz they
*  Would do this and then they bet they would cover that. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, right. Yeah, it's amazing
*  I've been on rabbit holes for YouTube. I've been on a rabbit hole of
*  Groundhog Day
*  So like same thing of living the same day over and over again
*  And one of them was how long did Bill Murray spend day after day? It was a total amount of time
*  What was the toll on my they think it's a route because they were like it's death here to do this many times
*  It's right, you know bowling a perfect game all these different things. They said about 30 years
*  Whoa of living the same day over and over again
*  You don't know I used to think yeah, and then you would do everything
*  Yeah, as I was getting older one of the things I thought I was like
*  Why do why do I have this expectation that at some point in time a person stops learning and growing?
*  Like I never expected people in their 60s like being better people and learning more
*  They're done. Yeah, they're done. Whoever that guy is. He's done because people do stop right?
*  But why so my thought was like why do I have these expectations for people instead of just being open-minded?
*  I almost assume
*  That when people hit a certain age they're fucking done they throw in the towel
*  But but you do meet some people who don't do that, right? Who are like taking an art class somebody's mom or grandmother
*  That's like, um, I'm learning archery and sick. Well, that's cool when Bourdain was 58 and he started getting seriously fucking into jujitsu
*  Like seriously into jujitsu. I was like look at you motherfucker. I love it. Well, that's how you I mean like love it went for
*  taking lessons
*  Private lessons every day for an hour and then training and rolling with people for an hour every day
*  Wow, really seven days a week like heroin like how he was it used to be addicted to heroin
*  He got addicted to jujitsu all in developed a six-pack got really act dude
*  Jacked there's a picture of walking down the street in in Italy full-on six-pack
*  Yeah, I mean you're looking like this is the guy that I used to know that was on high. He was on
*  High cholesterol medication he was on statins because of his diet because he's on the road drinking wine
*  Eating fucking this and that and fatty foods and a lot of sugar and just drinking whatever the fuck he wants, right?
*  Yeah, and then he's and he got fat, you know, I'm not fat like a big fat guy
*  But he definitely developed like a little belly then boom. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It looks like Dan Bilzerian, dude
*  He got into jujitsu and completely transformed his body lost all the weight
*  Stopped eating sugar started eating and stopped eating carbs started eating really healthy cut way back on the drinking and
*  Developed a goddamn
*  Legitimate six-pack super healthy. It's gonna live forever. I think that's a nine. That's a seven pack that bottom one is a solid one
*  Oh, yes, right. So you got one two, three, four, five six seven
*  That's a seven pack people always like to say eight pack, but I don't ever see a separation in that bottom one
*  The time to be like some kind of turtle person, you know
*  Yeah, yeah, it's like a long way it's the tan line point is like the dude transformed his fucking body
*  Completely strong a lot of dick root there though. I'm not happy about I mean, it's low
*  I love I think I like bought those shorts like 20 pounds ago. No, maybe it could be that where'd you get that ball?
*  Who brought that in oh
*  Dave Leduc. Yeah, Dave Leduc is a let's way champion
*  He's he fights in the most brutal form of stand-up striking with a headbutt and they really soccer kick each other on the way
*  Down and where do you get that Thailand? Probably he got it or Burma in I think it was Myanmar Myanmar Burma
*  Yes, yeah, dude. They play these games. Yeah, he showed us the volleyball game. Yeah, that's that's the best. Yeah
*  Oh my god, right. They get above the net with their leg. Yeah
*  It's and they play first of all barefoot most of the time. Mm-hmm. I saw a guy play a one-on-three for money
*  Oh my god, he was like amazing. Good. Yeah, and these other guys were just like laughing about it
*  They were trying to like fuck he was spiking it spikes it down with his foot
*  Yeah, that's my second day in Yangon. You're seeing this stuff. You're like, how are they doing this and barefoot on concrete?
*  I've seen it only on a dirt floor that they're barefoot. That's a lot of dirt
*  Wow, it's it's nuts. That is Christ. It's so cool. It's one of the coolest kids I've ever seen
*  Well, and they keep it going they have circles where they just get going and like yeah, they do the kick this one
*  I mean, I'm sure you talked about it. They do this is fine
*  I get that but when it goes over your head doing this
*  Yeah, they hit this straight and know how to pop it right back up, right?
*  I've tried it a hundred times at best. I can do is kick it that way
*  I think it's one of those things that if your body doesn't develop throwing your legs around like that
*  Yeah, it's really hard to do
*  That was the thing about taekwondo like when I was teaching you would get people that were like in their thirties
*  It was really hard for them to learn it really hard for them to get good
*  Yeah, they can like whip their leg around but if you get those little kids when they're like five and six
*  They look to teach them how to whip their legs into things. Yeah, here they go. Oh my god. They're so good verse three
*  Oh, that's the one on three one. Well, I don't know if it's the one you saw but this is a you can use your head
*  One verse three guy. Well, this seems like these guys are fucking it up. Well, they're also American
*  Oh, they're Americans that are trying to play. They're playing good. Oh my god. Look at him
*  Oh, he fucked up. Oh you fucked up loser dork fucking helmet. No, it's a bandana
*  This is a wild game though man, very oh my god, haha you got beaten you're not better than everyone
*  Yeah stupid
*  Killer game. Yeah. Oh man
*  If you can learn that how to whip your legs around like that when you're like eight or nine years old as you get older
*  You'll you'll maintain that sort of
*  Legdexterity. Yeah, I sent one of those back. I have one of those in my apartment. Oh, really? Yeah, I sent it back
*  I took it from from Myanmar to Thailand and then I was like I need to send this to myself
*  Yeah, and they're like I can get it there in two days I'm like no I don't need there I'm like slower than that
*  What's cheaper? They're like, I mean a week. I'm like you do not I'm in no
*  I won't be there for like months like we get you in three months for like four dollars and I'm like, yep
*  That's the one no rush. That's the deal three months for it was like so slow. It was by mule or something
*  And I was like, I'm not there. So go ahead somebody mule did away. Yeah, I'm you'll meeting someone stuffed in
*  the whole fucking box
*  It's a weird game it's
*  That's one
*  where
*  Like you need a certain specific kind of athleticism
*  Yeah, like someone is an outstanding basketball player or a football player. You're not gonna be good at that, right?
*  That's not just pure athleticism. That's a weird
*  Leg dexterity skill. Oh my god. They do it
*  I mean you think about like what I can throw a lot of crazy kicks. I can't do what those guys are doing
*  No, I don't know how to do that. I can kick over my head. I could do a split
*  Really? I'm a lot of wild shit still learning to kick and for yeah
*  Yeah, you'd have to learn how to jump up and you're you're whipping down and you're gonna get a leg up
*  But it's up and spot and they think you'd have to be crazy flexible, too
*  It looks like you got to be crazy flexible. I'm watching their legs fly up
*  There's no resistance at all. Yeah, most people have a lot of resistance when you try to lift your leg up
*  They're doing it all the time all the time. Yeah, what are you doing your next special?
*  I don't think I'm thinking about it good. I'm right now just writing. Yeah, just enjoying performing and
*  When I get the the bug when it feels like hmm, this is there
*  I want to you know, I was thinking about I actually talked about this with Malcolm Gladwell on the last podcast
*  I was talking I was quoting Jeselnik the Jeselnik. He has a three-year process
*  He does it in the clubs just around LA develops an hour
*  Okay, then he takes it on the road for in clubs and then he takes on the road the next year in theater
*  So it's a three-year process
*  Like that might be the way to go
*  Yeah, Louie had that with but not in the three year just like in the when he was doing them like, you know
*  He's doing a month one month four months. Yeah, he was doing he was doing a new special in a year
*  Yeah, which I guess you could if that's all you did and you just really dug into it
*  But I think things need time to cook also I find there's some times where it's like I watch a tell a lot in
*  New York. He's like the best. I was just saying that to Malcolm Gladwell, too
*  Really? He was the guy that I said if there's one person who's like at a super elite level where he doesn't get enough love
*  It's David tell and it's like you see him on a regular basis. You know, like Jesus he's just on a level above
*  Even the highest level people yeah
*  Super dedicated to only his craft. Yeah, he has zero promotion in him. Yeah, and so when he does a
*  He has a topical bit. He's not thinking like well
*  I don't have time to work on this for three weeks until people don't know the reference anymore, right?
*  Because I got to work on a special he's not thinking that way
*  He's like, oh I got three weeks with this fucking topic, right?
*  so he hits a harder than anybody and
*  Then when people like starting to like lose the memory of the of the topic. He's just moves on
*  Yeah, but he's kind of having fun though, right and like doing new cool things
*  He's also a guy says the best example somebody got better when they got sober. Yeah
*  Yeah, the best example, right? Cuz nobody else does
*  Right. Everybody else gets sober and then they get serious and it's like, oh, come on. Yeah, exactly
*  It's a human better thing anymore. Come on
*  That's the beautiful thing about
*  Podcasts to one of the beautiful things is that you don't have to like ideas that you have that aren't funny
*  You don't have to bring them to the stage. They're fine on podcast. Yeah. Yeah, they fit for that
*  Yeah, cuz remember there's like a point in time after Hicks where a lot of people were trying to do bits on stage that meant something
*  Yeah, you see them doing that you're like, okay, it's fine if you have that but like I just always feel like this
*  Like why are you not being funny? Why are you pushing that right?
*  And so the Hicks did it and honestly, I don't I have the same problem with him. Hey, how dare you?
*  It's just like it's so much not funny
*  But but a lot funny to men a lot funny
*  Yes, I'm funny shit and you got to also take it in the context of the time
*  Right if you were alive back then and watching it back then it would be really funny shit
*  You know when I saw him was like 90. Yeah, you got to put the context of the time
*  I just never got it really well
*  I saw him in like the first time I saw him was like 88
*  But were you laughing when you heard it or were you just like whoa? Yeah right on man both. Okay both
*  I was laughing right and I was saying wow this guy's he's out there
*  Yeah, he was like railing against capitalism and fucking Tiffany in the mall with Jimi Hendrix
*  He had this crazy bit like Tiffany like think I'm alone now running into Jimi Hendrix at the mall
*  Yeah, he just had all these like counterculture bits. Yeah, you know a lot of it was mocking
*  ridiculous trends in American culture. He just had some very very
*  Unique takes on things that didn't necessarily
*  Fit with our idea what we thought comedy was like you never thought like oh, yeah
*  That's you make comedy out of that too
*  He that's what he would do so he was like making comedy out of like weird ideas like anti-war
*  ideas and he was doing stuff that other people weren't doing and
*  It changed people's opinion to comedy because there was something about when Hicks would go on stage
*  You would feel like why Richard Jenny said this to me. Yeah, Richard Jenny back then was the master. He was great
*  He said every time I see him I say why don't I write more shit like that?
*  That's what Jenny said to me. Well after he saw Hicks he was always think
*  Wow, I don't write things because he was so deep picks and very deep and Jenny was Jenny was just funny
*  He was just writing funny things. He was just that way when some master looks at somebody else and it's like
*  Oh, I can't be more like that. It's like damn. You're not happy. Well, Jenny was never happy. Oh, yeah
*  He was a guy that
*  for whatever reason thought that he had to be
*  Like Seinfeld with a television show or Jim Carrey with a movie career he had to be that and
*  He was like the most
*  Probably underappreciated stand-up in my opinion one of the most underappreciated ones ever but definitely from his era
*  Yeah, meanwhile, he has all these specials that you can go watch you watch how good the guy wasn't when I saw him live again
*  In the context of the time because I saw him live and like Jenny first
*  First time I saw was 88 but I saw him a bunch of times but I saw him murder at the Comedy Works in Montreal
*  Oh, you know that room is like a hundred people max right? Oh that place tiny-ass room upstairs
*  He lit that fucking place on fire and I remember he was doing it
*  He was doing a bit about a some guy trying to sell him a car some car salesman selling him a car and I was like
*  This is like the most
*  Standard blah premise. How could he extract so much comedy out of someone selling him a car?
*  But it was like a murderous bit. It was just crushing just punchline after punchline bang bang bang. You're like fuck
*  But again, it's like I've said this so many times about him
*  You got to be there in that moment stand up on TV is
*  Maybe 60% as funny as it is when you're seeing it live. Maybe that's why people go what are they laughing because they're there
*  It's funnier. It's funnier when you're there, right?
*  Comedy Club is the funniest a theater second arenas arena just gets crazy. The arenas are weird
*  It's like you're laughing, but it's also like why many fucking people are here. It's like this weird feeling to it
*  There's an extra energy to it. Yeah
*  Watching it
*  So you if you watch Richard Jennings and you go, I didn't think it was that funny. Listen to me
*  You gotta be in the room where you have to be the room and second of all, we're in 2019, right?
*  This is 1990, right? Wow almost 30. Yeah, I mean the first time I watched him was
*  I think it was 92 or 93 on
*  on stage at
*  The Comedy Works, but the first time I saw him physically I was an open mic er that was in 88
*  I paid to see him at catch rising star in Cambridge and it was a half-filled room
*  It's like a Thursday night, you know
*  He was like a guy who had been on the Tonight Show and I knew him because he had been on the Tonight Show
*  You were comic and I was a comic
*  I was you know, maybe a weekend or something like that
*  Yeah, and I paid to go see him and me and my friends sat in the front row
*  And he made fun of me was excellent, but he was great
*  he was great and he was like so casual and loose with like his punch lines and
*  I remember thinking god damn like this fucking guy. He's got it made
*  He's just traveled around the country doing stand-up, but he he didn't think that way
*  He wanted to be a movie star
*  You look at people and you're like, you know, you would have killed for your life and you're upset about it right now
*  Yeah, you would have killed for your life 20 years ago. Oh my god. I mean forever dude
*  What I wanted to do from the time I was a beginner in 1988 was I wanted to make a living doing comedy
*  Yeah, that's not everything's gravy. Everything's exactly. It's gravy. Yeah, listen
*  I've lived in a shitty apartment. The only thing that sucks about shitty apartments is bugs and crime roommates
*  That's it. You get used to everything you do. It's fine. Everything. It's really fine
*  It takes like a week and then you're used to it prison may be a little different
*  Yeah, everybody was different
*  But if you got freedom if you're in a place as long as you're not your life's not being threatened and you're fucking
*  Things aren't getting stolen all that other stuff was mostly bullshit
*  If your house has two bedrooms or four bedrooms, you get used to it get used to everything man
*  $8,000 theory everything over eighty eight thousand dollars doesn't yeah does not improve your happiness
*  You're improved your happiness does improve with more money up to eighty eight thousand that makes and then it's like a new Lamborghini
*  Gives you the same happiness as a new
*  You know BMW Honda. It's like probably the thing about a Lamborghini is you can't leave it anywhere
*  You know, that's the thing about those if you got a stupid car like that
*  You don't just pull it up to the mall and park anywhere you know, you feel weird, you know
*  And this guy had a Lamborghini in his driveway, but he didn't have it in his garage
*  She just had it parked in his driveway and it was kind of like sticking out in the street
*  People are whizzing by a wham wham in Malibu
*  Yeah
*  Like what a weird thing Malibu is where these houses that are on the fucking highway like on the Pacific Coast Highway
*  It's a highway. Yeah, and there's a door that's five feet from a speeding car
*  Yeah, I don't have to get the cart into those driveways. Do they barely get in there without dying?
*  But then how do they get out flying by wow? Yeah 60 and they're and they're just turned off
*  Yeah, and there's a ton of bars on that fuck. Yeah
*  Street
*  I mean you have never driven have allegedly never driven drunk never you've never driven drunk in that street
*  When you see cars, everybody know they're Mel Gibson. He set the tone
*  Footsteps that's he wanted a crazy anti-jew rant, right? Are you sure did?
*  None of us cared the Jews
*  We thought it was funny
*  Well, it's just the worst one was the the voicemails that the wife the hot tub the one
*  Yeah, that was great. You should shut up and blow me
*  She felt you know, I like I didn't want to support her ability to do that. How does she do that?
*  How are you allowed to do that to what be?
*  Record someone's voicemails and then play it on the internet. Yeah, that should be like really illegal
*  Especially if you're married to Mel Gibson, you know and he's drinking
*  Even now, yeah, he's a fucking nice guy man
*  I met him on with dr. Neil Reardon talk about stem cells stem cells like severely helped his father
*  His father was kept my wife's neck to give me a blow job. Whoa
*  So I don't think that was on the tapes. Okay
*  What is like
*  That's blaming the Jews is a weird one. It is a weird one. It's a weird one. It's almost like so antiquated
*  It's a when you're when you that's your go-to things to blame the Jews
*  Yeah, I'm taking our jobs is a lot more obvious. But what jobs I know I know that not they're right
*  But it's more like I don't agree back. Okay, I can see it but the Jews it really is a throwback thing, right?
*  It's a weird one. It's a weird one because the it's almost always there's some sort of intoxicant or some sort of a psychological issue
*  Yeah, it's always like when you when your default is go to the Jews
*  We can't use how much has the Jews had an impact on your life
*  Like I'm not saying that some people haven't had
*  Bad situations with people that happen to be Jewish
*  But I want to know like if we could have a chart we show all the people that rally against the Jews
*  Find out how many Jewish people have actually had a negative impact on your life. What is the numbers?
*  I bet that numbers pretty goddamn low Mel Gibson would be like the Jews are the ones who were take holding my money back
*  They're the producers. Is that what he would say? Maybe because I'm saying that's what the Jews he's come in contact with
*  Didn't he do the only Jews are the ones that Christ and make like some
*  ungodly sum of money. I think he did that on a ballsy move though. I think one of the things he did was he
*  Took ownership of the film. So he financed it
*  Passion project. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think I think that's the case if I remember correctly the passion of the Christ
*  He's a very religious guy and his father is too was too. Yeah, right, right. Yeah, it's very Catholic
*  Oh, no, I think of Ken. No, no, no, I think you're thinking of Schwarzenegger Austria. Yeah, baby
*  Yeah, I don't think he has Nazi roots either, but maybe someone in the family. So is that right? It's dad. It's dad grandfather. It's dad
*  Yeah, somebody might have some questions about the Holocaust. I don't know if those Mel Gibson's family
*  Someone's family. Yeah, I don't know whose family it was. I remember something
*  I don't remember what it was but he
*  So when he made passion to Christ, yeah, he like said look this means a lot to me
*  I want to do this movie. I'm gonna just pump it and he had all that loot from Braveheart
*  He put his own money in pretty sure is that the case?
*  It's a production company spent 30 million to produce. That's a lot of money
*  It's a big that's more than I'm spending on Ari Shafir Jew taping February 8th the Skirball Center in New York get tickets at
*  artythegreat.com
*  That's a smooth segue
*  Are you doing sets in town the week of that you're doing that? Yeah, probably do other material those those nights
*  Oh really? You wouldn't want to run the set like I've been running it. Okay, so long. Nice so many times
*  That's a good feeling. Huh? Yeah, it's just in groove. I did it last night at the store
*  That was like three days out. I was like, hey, give me a belly room or insurance like I've a man was like whatever
*  I'll be 50 people in there. Yeah, so yeah, I'm just running the shit out of it all the time beautiful
*  Yeah, that's nice. That's a good place to be where you just have it down. Yeah. Yeah, that's nice
*  The Skirball is a good place to what we talked about it
*  We're like some of these synagogues were like I was back in bending over too much to like make it work in a synagogue
*  It would look cool. I was worried about the sound. Yes worried about this the height of the ceilings. This place was massive
*  Yeah, beautiful synagogue and filled up. Oh, but
*  Anyway after agonizing over it they came back a week later like we don't want you to do it
*  Oh, it didn't even matter. Yeah
*  They probably googled you
*  Wolf shot there. She said there were good shows. She really liked that place. Oh at the synagogue. No, no
*  Yeah, so I'm excited about it. I'm really excited about it. Yeah, the Skirball is legit
*  That's a that's a spot that a lot of people perform at. That's that's a time-tested spot
*  You don't have to worry about that part of it cool part of town to doing something on a synagogue man
*  Like who knows if it's gonna work. What kind of sound you're gonna have?
*  What kind of echoes are gonna be the people gonna get in the audience is gonna be weird
*  When it comes through on the television is it worth it? It was a worth it
*  That's really how to agonize over is it worth what percentage?
*  Worst might this be the laughter versus what do I gain from the look two of the things you talk about?
*  They're very important one is to do it in New York. I think that's huge. It's a gigantic Jewish community
*  It's the it's where the Jews in America. Yeah, Boston is like maybe second but not as prominent
*  New York is where it's at. Yeah, and then on top of that like that's where you perform most of the time
*  You sure to I know these audience is there. Yeah, and the Skirball dude, come on man. You can't go wrong there
*  Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it. It's perfect
*  It's because the theme like it is self it once you've get past what the theme is people just want to hear the material
*  It doesn't matter. Yeah, you're in a synagogue. Okay, so that's what I did
*  Yeah, but that's what I did with this thing
*  So I was like I'm gonna work out all this shit this theme stuff in clubs in New York and LA
*  You know just regular club sets funny right follow big Jay
*  You know talking about some relationship in the crowd or follow some Bobby Lee doing whatever right and then just like I'll just do this
*  And it has to be as funny as those guys. Yeah with the theme
*  That's big people like not notice the theme. Yeah. Yeah, and then they stand up
*  Yeah, it's just stand up and then that theme is on top of it. But since it is that it's like, oh, yeah, that's awesome
*  So yeah, how much material do you I know you haven't how much material do you have outside of it?
*  A year ago and bro a year and three months or something like that
*  I did an add-on show after my last few shows were done were sold out that we did an add-on show in a
*  Tent and I was like, this will be the next specials
*  Material I just ran all my luck because I the problem is I go crazy with justice theme shit. Mm-hmm like it it's like
*  Annoying after a while, right? You don't want to talk about one subject
*  Well, you also get like, you know bits come because you get like your mind pops off
*  You see something see a homeless guy picking shit out of his ass. You're like, this is a bit, you know
*  Or that lady's on Sunset every comic at the store had a bit about that lady dancing in the street on Sunset
*  Because they all felt like they just are even though she was posted up there
*  I
*  Thinks make your mind pop off. So I still had that and I'm like, well, I got to do this for a week
*  You know or two or something just to get rid of that
*  Yeah, and then when I'm done like I express myself shit like that then I get back to the material. Mm-hmm
*  So November what was the date February 8th and it's already great comm are the great comm yeah
*  Yeah, so it's available right now right now. I'm telling everybody right now today. That's where I came out to fucking LA
*  Don't don't don't yeah February 8th though, which is February 8th, Manhattan, New York beautiful. That's plenty of time
*  You fucks get your shit together. You should get to make your plans and don't dose Ari as payback either
*  Plotting I know what we'll do right before a special switches water bottle
*  Yeah, like if I had a water bottle
*  That'd be crazy to get the exact same water bottle switch like an old spy are you and Burk cool did everything? Yeah, we're all right
*  That's right. Yeah, we're fine
*  Yeah, it was a rough one
*  Got weird. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, I think the lesson is don't dose anybody but yeah, that's definitely the lesson, you know
*  But I mean definitely do give free drugs to people but but on only if they ask for it. Yeah
*  Trouble that I thought of it. Yeah
*  Taking the consideration he's on medication either like that's the big one that they can do a lot. It's a consideration. Yeah
*  There's a bunch of issues there. Oh, well
*  Everything worked out you live you learn
*  I'm just never allowed in this home again. It's this new found zest for life. Yeah, given him this
*  That promo what drugs you've been on since the
*  Just pot just pot. Yeah, anything. Oh, yeah booze. Yeah booze and pot. Yeah, I think me too
*  No, no, I took some Molly a little bit. Mmm, just a little bit. Yeah, just a dance on
*  But that's it, how do you feel I feel good yeah me too, but I felt good sober too. Yeah me too. I enjoyed it
*  How do you feel being sober for the month? I enjoy it
*  Enjoy that there's no choice like sometimes I wanted a glass of wine with a steak
*  Yeah, but the reality the reality is doesn't matter. I don't really need it. It doesn't really make that much of a difference but like
*  Yeah, no, you don't need it. You can't enjoy the things out of life like we smoke right here
*  But it's like we don't have any parts like it's alright. We'll still do the podcast. Yeah, but
*  Yeah, we like it too. The thing about alcohol though versus pot is you pay a price
*  Yeah, you probably pay a price a wine or two beers. No
*  You pay a small price for a glass of wine or two beers small price. It's very small
*  You might not notice it. Maybe it's a quarter worth it
*  But if you have like three drinks you pay a few dollars you lose you gonna lose a feeling you're gonna lose a step
*  Yeah, it's a fact. It's a fact if you get hammered if you put you drink like seven eight drinks you get drunk the next day
*  You're gonna feel like shit, you know
*  That's true. But also that day if you're with friends drinking also feels really good. I've you worth it
*  Yeah, a good time to your friends getting a little loopy. Yeah, it's good point. That's where I miss it
*  The most not in moments. I didn't miss the drug
*  I missed the drug enhancing a moment that should have been Yankee Games my brother coming to town
*  Glass of wine at an Italian meal, you know where it's like, yeah, they want the wine once I have the Italian meal
*  It's like oh, yeah wine would be great here
*  Yeah for sure
*  Yeah, it's like it's a technology. They figured out how to alter your state predictably. Yeah a small glass of liquid
*  It's pretty great. It's pretty amazing. Yeah, the first few days I was struggling
*  I passed by locked cabinets of like liquor hotels. I'm like, but it's like everything else right? It's like you can abuse
*  Virtually everything that everybody enjoys whether it's okay or sex or anything or electronics or anything
*  Television there's some people that watch television 12 fucking hours a day
*  So just sit in front of the TV and watch TV all day
*  What do you do to limit yourself on there on TV? No on that fucking stupid thing
*  I've been really good with it lately
*  What I mostly do is the one thing that I do trick myself with like I said is those Google stories
*  I read too many I read news stories then I wind up reading like scientific stories about
*  Like fucking space and all these different things a because it's interesting and two because I'm getting to look at my phone
*  So it's like I'm tricking myself into saying oh, this is but this is a crucial information
*  I need to have like I could also it's because of the feeling I need to check this. Yes
*  You got banned for three days and it's grand for something that shit happens
*  He said during that time he was banned where he's like, oh, I'm banned for sure
*  He checked his phone like 72 times check his Instagram. It's like I still bit like he's just reflexively we end up going to that
*  Because the lights and colors or whatever. I don't know but it's not good for you
*  The parental control it shuts it off after I use it for an hour. Whatever you want to set it to
*  Yeah, my girlfriend put the code on there. Yeah, so I can't I can't override it
*  Yeah, you know even more if I need to if I need to promote something big I need to be on there all day
*  I would tell her take it off
*  But like otherwise what's the here now?
*  It says you got five minutes left if you're gonna make a post about a show do it fucking now, right?
*  And then you're done then it's over
*  Yeah
*  And so it's like and then I end up using it a little less
*  Because I don't want to waste that hour in case let's say I want to push something later, right?
*  I want to get on there, you know
*  So I want to save some time and then I end up only using it for like whatever but I need that parental control
*  It's very rare that I really do need to answer emails on my phone rarely and you can do it an hour a day
*  Just get it all done or do it on your computer only
*  The only time is like say if you were in the middle of a deal like you're about to sign a deal for your special
*  And you're going back before the screwball the screwball February 8th. It's called already the great calm
*  Yeah, you can get tickets right now
*  But if you were gonna do that like that kind of makes sense, you would check your phone during the day, right?
*  That's the time most the time. No, I check it in the morning
*  Just to make sure there's not some nonsense that I forgot I have to do during the day
*  And then I try not to check my email at all until I start doing podcast ads
*  Okay
*  So one thing I would say for that is what I like is not checking it for the first and I fail first hour
*  Or two of the day. That's good. That's my best
*  Phone don't even look and I set a time of 11 or 12 if I wake up at 9 or 10 great
*  We're gonna 1130 whatever but like until 12
*  Like don't touch it
*  You know my favorite thing to do and I've only done this a couple of times
*  Legitimately is don't look at my phone at all and go right to yoga class great
*  And then your mind's racing your mind's racing
*  It's all the fucks the whole night before I even see the whole night instead of bike bogging it down and like yeah
*  Does this deal sound good for this club and what do you think for t-shirts?
*  It's just like yeah, just let your mind wander where it's supposed to no one else
*  What I as fuck for you get high as fuck
*  Don't look at your phone get high as fuck before yoga you come out of there a different person from another dimension a different
*  Whole in the time space continuum, you know, just drop out of there you start thinking change your universe
*  Life you ever space out when you're doing like a back on your back thing
*  And then all of a sudden you like you come to like not not asleep just like
*  How long was I out yeah, you can get zoned out man
*  You're messing with your consciousness when you're doing that. Yeah, you're holding those poses and breathing
*  You're messing with your conscious and I say that in a good way
*  How they did a new Netflix special about that Bikram guy
*  Really? Yeah, I haven't seen it but I saw there's ads a lot of people are changing the name of their
*  Class I know the one I went to two years ago. They're just calling it hot. Yeah. Yeah. She was like, yeah
*  Well, no one wants to be associated with that. They're hippies. That guy's a full rapist. Yeah, he definitely has some issues
*  Why would that read those women? I feel one woman would pay a million dollars for one job of my one
*  My see them. Yeah, why would I rip one drop off my sperm?
*  Yogi guru predator. I like how he has a bunch of Rolls Royces. That's my favorite part
*  He and he does yoga with a Rolex on holo. Do you think that's on his card? Yogi guru predator?
*  Now it is now now they probably put it on there. He's a fucking character man in the worst way possible
*  But he's definitely a character
*  These are thing man when when you're around a bunch of these freaky people
*  I'll see that movie when you're around a bunch of these freaky people and everybody's half-naked and you know
*  You're the guy who's the one who teach them how to do yoga. Yeah, they're the master you get to fuck dude
*  Isn't it weird when you see somebody who went all-in with yoga? Oh, yes, like they shaved their heads
*  Oh, yeah, the only way the yoga pits like that is their being but if that's what me what I started wearing yoga pants everywhere
*  Oh
*  Joe wait yoga Joe. I'll go well
*  I already wear a fanny pack. What would be the problem?
*  Different world a yoga Joe what what a Bikram t-shirt on if you're allowed to wear a Bikram t-shirt
*  You got to wear it now, right?
*  It's I think the specials out this Netflix documentary. I think it's out. Is that the new standard special people don't know about it
*  Yeah, they're really going broad. That's after Paul Rudd. They just went right to Bikram
*  One drop of my sperm
*  We've been spent one million dollar. I would like show me one woman who spent a million dollars in your sperm
*  You'll get one drop. Yeah, you get for a million. It's a whole load
*  I know someone who runs a yoga studio and that was the fucking final nail in the coffin when he said that
*  Yeah, one drop off my sperm. They're like, alright changing the name
*  But I think back when he started getting crazy right how old is he now
*  78 is that hold? He's probably pretty fucking old right 40 back when he first came here in the 80s and they're like doing
*  you remember girls wear like scrunchie socks and it was
*  Remember like they like Olivia Newton John, let's get physical. That's get physical girls are taking they were taking aerobics classes
*  Buying those Reeboks aerobics shoes with the Velcro everybody had those the socks had a little poofy ball
*  That's right the little poofy ball the sock. I forgot about that
*  That was when that dude started slinging. So he came over here from India shorts with leggings underneath. Oh, that's right
*  That's right. Sure. It's a land colored leggings. Yep. So he came over here from India and started teaching and
*  Just letting the old snake out of the basket. Whoo
*  To make like Indian music sounds and say he took the snake out of the basket
*  Insinuating his cock but yet he's a snake charmer
*  You definitely got joke wise you got two levels joke wise you're clean. Yeah, it's okay. Yeah, but for structure is great
*  Racists because that's because I make the noise to
*  Because if you say something about someone from China and you went bang bang bang. Yeah, then racism. Oh my god, you're racist
*  Okay. Well, well definitely I would say
*  There is an argument for racist
*  Valid that argument is yeah, maybe
*  You could but that's not all super woke you could go in on me. Oh, yeah
*  Yeah, if you were really woke you could take a swing
*  Well, that's like, you know, you know who have fucking
*  That's the woke swing. Do you know who fucking never never gets stood up for it's fat white guys
*  Well, you can shit on fat white guys. They're not even human
*  Nobody gives a fuck about the way they feel those me. Oh
*  But I would say please do oh you talking about Bert? No
*  He's not fat anymore. He's not obese anymore. He lost a lot of weight just overweight
*  He lost a lot a lot of way looks good. Yeah, that's very good. He there's only one guy now. It is not look good
*  Tom you just say Tom. No, I heard you say Tom. I didn't say Tom
*  It looks fine to me
*  Is he really oh, yeah Wow that Burt's winning now
*  Yeah, well I told bird if he makes 205 he gets the belt yeah, I text any point I text anytime
*  He I text him two weeks out. Are you gonna make the weight?
*  He's like, oh, I don't think so open on the road. I'll come on pussy. How much you weigh?
*  I go dude, there's guys who weigh
*  235 on Tuesday and they fight on Saturday at 205. You can cut that they cut the weight. Yeah, I
*  Would love to see the fucking
*  This no no this guy was
*  A wrestler that guy's very big ranting in a ring. I think he's in Australia. What's he running about?
*  He's like look big J's in the background talking shit to the crowd
*  For those that are watching you can't see this but they're like just 10 15
*  I just want to skip ahead to the end here. What's happening? He's being the heel. He's great. Oh
*  What is he there's a guy that yells out he calls him Tom Segura
*  Sorry fucked up, that's right play it back fine. We'll find it. Yeah. No, I enjoy your failure here
*  Thanks
*  That's hilarious
*  Hey, Tom Segura rap random rules
*  Yeah, that might not have actually been said that sounds like someone inserted that sound
*  Maybe I'm not I'm not buying it. Oh, yeah good point. I
*  Know what they're doing. They found some guy doing that and some some other guy. Yes, that's what we hear that again play it again
*  Yeah, I might be right
*  Yeah
*  I
*  Don't buy that sounds like that's an echoey room that sounds like that guy did in his bathroom
*  Yeah, his mom's like why are you screaming?
*  In the wind why you screaming Jimmy?
*  Not buying it says no gimmicks
*  Gimmicks as well. That'd be a good way to do a good gimmick
*  Yeah, there's no the law is not struck down the no gimmicks claim, bro. That's a lonely road, right?
*  We're talking about the road of being a stand-up traveling and doing stand-up being a pro wrestler that nobody knows like
*  They're trying to make it on the circuit. Whoo like doing what that guy was doing. Yeah, that's rough. That's tough. That's rough
*  Cole Cabana ever talked to him. No. Yeah, he's like a legit wrestler wrestler just on the road all the time. It's hard, right?
*  Yeah, is your friend Tommy still bowling professionally? No, his legs are shot out
*  His knees are from bowling from bowling. Yeah, I guess so Jesus Christ think we used to be cavemen
*  We used to be able to fight off saber-toothed tigers and neighboring tribes ranked fifth in the world in bowling
*  This is how great stand-up is right now. He's like fifth in the world in bowling and he made 35 grand that year
*  Behind him. Yeah, that always comes up on reddit because that sign so
*  his
*  Knees are shot from bowling. I think so. I
*  Don't know. What do you do that in bowling that makes your knees go? Let's see
*  Okay, here we go bar that torque I think
*  Yeah, I guess right yeah, yeah, yeah that makes sense if you twist harder you bite torque but you're on those slidey shoes
*  You're gonna slide his shoes you slide in
*  My slide issues grip with your
*  I do know there's some pros are playing to like their 40s and 50s
*  It seems like slidey shoes wouldn't be the way to go like if I didn't know better
*  I know I know you don't want to stop sure
*  But I'm saying I do know that slidey shoes the way to go because the pros use them
*  They're not stupid, but I would think that if you had more grip you could wing the ball harder
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. I think it's that the movement they got going
*  There's like a momentum and a whip. Yeah
*  Let's watch some strikes. They almost all says it's arm injuries except for MCO. Oh
*  Like just common bowling injuries
*  Yeah, yeah, do you know how many fucking Marines are laughing right now
*  You fucking bowling
*  You've been you've been afghanistan have you been to hard work lanes over on third
*  That's a hard lane. There's a lot of dips a lot of dips. They don't grease up the rails
*  You know they like they're carve a balls will carve a groove you got to find the groove
*  Yeah, so he says it so this is how the tournament works
*  You play the whole week and the top five going to the tournament
*  The winner of that plays third the winner that plays second winner that plays first for the championship
*  So if you're in first place for the week, you have to play one game. Whoa, if a lefty is in the fourth fifth game
*  If that lefty wins, he's already set a groove that only he's gonna be in
*  Whereas the righty has to use the other guy's groove and so it's like he's not setting his own
*  The lefty will go all the way and win. Wow. Yeah, and it's cuz the oil it's because they've grooved up that the fucking lane
*  They're way exactly the same
*  Grooved up that the fucking lane their way exactly. No one's working it up fucked it up to righties like
*  I remember it's a great game for six-year-olds
*  That's what it is. It's like it's like pool if you only broke the balls and people get mad at me
*  How can you say that put Bowie's to scale it up?
*  They get so angry
*  35 K for number five. Yeah, just shut it for just shut your mouth. It's a child's game
*  They have roommates on tour. My ball is 15 pounds
*  I'd like to see a six-year-old throw it
*  They have roommates on tour. Yeah, the best guys have a roommate for the week. Yeah, they have to do there are
*  bowling groupies that are hideous
*  Every industry has a groupie and the only groupie is not great. Every industry must have groupies. Yeah
*  Yeah, well, they're like, I know you from the scene
*  Yeah, even ones you would think no fucking way
*  Bowlers like you used to think no fucking way for like guys who played video games
*  But they have a shirt ninjas getting his dick sucked. Wow right now
*  Yes for sure, but there's other guys that you could say for sure. You're technically your wife could suck your dick
*  Oh, yeah, I know it's foreign to a lot of men, but she could do it if she really cares. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's um, there's a lot of money in it
*  So once there's a lot of money in something you get groupies
*  Yeah, 100% but even not even if it's just that well you had pool groupies, didn't you?
*  Did you have lounge lasers that hung out there?
*  There was a few really hardcore drug addicts that would hang around the pool room and then some like really lonely ladies
*  And then there's a few girls who played pool and they would hook up with guys too because they saw like these guys are the best
*  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there was a few of those girls who would get really they would be pool players
*  They'd be really into like the pros. They would hook up with the pros
*  University yeah, yeah, right and they'd be like hang out waiting to like score with yeah that
*  Man, the only thing that saves pool is well, there's some games
*  There's no there's some tournaments to be played in America some but in other countries. There's a lot of money
*  There's big like they go to Qatar and they play billiards in China and you can make like real money in tournaments out there
*  But you have to be like a Shane van boning or you know, it's a deaf one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  He's top of the food chain you have to be like him. You know, there's a few of those guys
*  Jason Shaw, there's a few of those guys that are like just straight-up killers
*  They could travel the world and they're fucking bitches all the time. Um, I don't know
*  I don't know. I would imagine if you're like an elite pool player and you're a handsome fella, you'd probably get a little tail
*  Get a few players. Yeah, but they're like maybe I'm in a pool and you're the best
*  That's the thing about if you went to a Denmark might be like us. Yeah
*  Yes, yes, yeah
*  Like in the Philippines pools huge
*  Philippines is like there's this guy Efren Reyes
*  he's probably the greatest pool player of all time and he's from the Philippines and that guy is a
*  Star over there. He does commercials and all kinds of crazy shit. Everybody knows him. I keep people see him on the street
*  Yeah, it's like pick like a like Tiger Woods. I got Tiger Woods is for golf
*  That's how Efren Reyes is for pool Tiger Woods goes anywhere
*  People know who Tiger Woods is if Efren goes anywhere in the Philippines, he does commercials with Manny Pacquiao
*  Like in Manny knows many actually plays really good pool better than me. He plays like professional level pool
*  Yeah, how come you can say Filipinos are
*  Standardly way better pool than us because of the night can't say America is clearly the best comics in the world
*  Oh, you can of course you can well some Americans
*  Just as good and I mean pool players are just as good
*  Van Boening the top one. Yeah, but overall overall Filipinos have a lot of great pool players
*  They have a lot of killers, but there's a lot of kids killers over here too. Now this killers from Europe
*  There's a lot of killers from Europe pool. Yeah pools different, but with stand-up get the fuck out of here
*  You know why I think I think of England
*  It came from like theater and here came from like storytelling just like
*  Fire well it came from a lot of variety shows to like Lenny Bruce used to do used to do stand-up on variety
*  Yeah, there'd be like a band would come out and like you ever watch marvelous Mrs. Mays
*  Well, they have it that way like someone comes out and they got an act they do some kind of an act
*  They have like a fucking puppet act and they introduced the band and then they introduced the band a band will come play a song
*  And then Lenny Bruce will go on and do some stand-up
*  You know, I mean and then you know, that's that's how they did it back then
*  They didn't necessarily have comedy clubs
*  We talked about that yesterday with the ice house that the ice house is the oldest comedy club technically
*  But it really didn't become a full-time comedy club until 1978. Where's the store?
*  Was it full-time in 72? Yeah, so they were a full-time
*  First we kept saying it was older, but it wasn't a comedy club. It's not really it was but it was a variety show
*  They'd have magic and fucking bands and all kinds of stuff
*  Yeah, that's I say one of Mitzzie's biggest decisions was going like we're going all comedy. We're not doing music comedy
*  We're doing all kind of people like you're out of your mind. She was the best. What a crazy loon. Thank God
*  Yeah, we needed her you need some jazz in people's oh my god. You needed her. Yeah, you needed her
*  Oh, she knew how to do it man. Yeah, I knew how to run a fucking a comedy club
*  She let people fucking figure it out on their own. Yeah
*  She wanted you to kill she just wanted you to develop and become better. Just be better. Yes, and then she'd
*  Always find a good spot to put you in the beginning
*  She put you on early you get it with a fresh crowd after a while you develop a little promise
*  She puts you on after hard people and if she liked you every set you're gonna go after a murderer
*  Right every set you go after she likes murderers murderers and then she would give you advice that wasn't funny
*  Thanks for the advice lady. That's gross. Stop doing it
*  But every now and then man, she'd throw me a gem. Just tell me how much she loves me
*  Yeah, yeah, just hear there man. What like a fucking abusive parent and then just give you a little
*  Okay, I was you know, 27 years old and I expected it going in I was happy just to talk to her
*  You got there when you were 27. Yeah, whoa. Yeah
*  26 really I went through the first time I went I was 26. Yeah, it was before that show hardball
*  I came out here with Brewer and he was on that show too. Yeah, he was Brewer was the mascot
*  In the first episode, yeah
*  He was a mascot of the opposing team
*  The pied pioneers and he had a fucking flute and shit and he got beat up by a giant baseball
*  That was our mascot. It was really funny Brewer
*  But uh Brewers fucking hilarious still is sure he's hilarious, but he was out here with me
*  we were doing that pilot and it was like I
*  Want to say it was like 93
*  Somewhere around then yeah
*  Really yeah, we came to the comedy store and we're just sitting in the back of the room watching that play
*  I remember thinking I can't believe I'm even here
*  I can't believe this is really the comedy store and then maybe six months later
*  I was out here living because the show got picked up maybe not even six months probably four months
*  You know you do a pilot pilot gets seen got picked up came back did six episodes and I was just hanging around the store
*  Well, that's when I got to meet mincy and she said you can perform there
*  I could be a non-paid regular first auditioned as a non-paid regular and no bullshit. I was there every fucking night
*  I didn't have a life man. I had nowhere to go and I didn't have any friends
*  So all I would do was go to the comedy store after I worked so I'd work all day on the TV show
*  I'd go home to my shitty Oakwood's apartment and one of them Oakwood's apartments at Burbank
*  You know one of those ones with it's a pre furnished apartment for people who are coming
*  Yeah, exactly and then somewhere around episode three I'm such a fucking genius I figured this show is gonna take off
*  I'm gonna get a lease so I got a lease for a year an apartment in North Hollywood a real apartment and
*  then the show got canceled
*  I was good, but it's good that I got that lease cuz I was gonna move back to New York
*  I did not like it. Yeah, that's what kept me. I couldn't move. I had
*  Spent in a can't remember how much it was but I remember had a pool table in the living room
*  There's the number one thing that I did
*  I got a place that was big enough for me to pull put a pool table in the living room Jesus
*  That's so that was my prerequisite. I'd walk out every apartment
*  I'd one two, three, four, five, six, seven eight nine. That's five feet with four on each side
*  So it's a nine by five, right a good table is four and a half by nine
*  So you want to give yourself like 15 feet width and then you want to give yourself a solid 20 feet length
*  So you measure out five on the front five on the back so you don't knock it with a stick when an addict yeah
*  Look for yeah, that's what I look for
*  That's like me when I go to a place like smokers allowed right pot and they're like
*  Cuz I want to know now where I'll just move on. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  But I had a neighbor they got mad that I was playing pool. Oh, yeah, I'm sure probably late at night too
*  No, no, no, no, he asked me to not do it until they don't use the living room because the floor was creaking and
*  This guy was like the superintendent of the building. I went what I said
*  So I'm walk you don't like me walking upstairs and he said well, you're walking around the pool table when you're playing pool
*  I go. What have I just walked you don't be walking
*  Are you telling me not to walk in the living room?
*  So you can hear me walking like what kind of floor is this?
*  Like what do you hear the floor that dude it was a carpeted floor too
*  It wasn't like I was like I had fucking cowboy boots and I was running around on a hardwood floor
*  I'm stomp. It was a regular. He said the floor creaks and it's annoying
*  Like wow
*  What the fuck can you please not walk that's over in New York that place was made out of cardboard though
*  Because I can hear everything you do is like well, what do you I don't want to tell you?
*  I could hear the phone ring and then I could hear the answering machine go off and the person
*  Like I could hear everything
*  Fucking thing they said and I didn't realize what a piece of shit the house was until we got an earthquake
*  One day I was in the apartment and if you've ever been in a legit earthquake, but this was like a five point five
*  This was the it was really the aftershocks of the big Northridge earthquake. Oh, man. So this apartment. I mean it just goes like this
*  It
*  Didn't do anything that I thought it was gonna do I felt like an earthquake would look everything was shake
*  Yeah, but it's like the movies it start moving back and forth like the like that's a big the apartment was made out of a refrigerator
*  Box that's it was like like if you if I was inside a refrigerator box and you were outside
*  I come on up pussy like that's what it was like. The whole thing was just moving the walls were just moving
*  I'm like this place is made of nothing. This is made of the cardboard. I
*  Remember thinking goddamn you're vulnerable when an earthquake hit when do you feel the first one here? You're just like whoa
*  Because you feel little ones all time. It feels like cars underneath you are so overdue. We're so overdue
*  They said that one of the fault lines moved recently for the first time in 500 years, dude. This is also from Myanmar
*  That that's weed bro. We don't know that's not for that's from Gino. All right, it's from LA speed weed son
*  Oh, that's a Mike Tyson joint actually really? Yeah, that's from Tyson's we know
*  Yeah, they have those cigars like that there. Yeah, this is not a cigar. Okay, don't put you on Pluto smoked out like
*  It's like Tyson. We he goes for it. Huh? We he goes for it. He goes for it
*  Like he went for in boxing. That's what he that's what he does with his weed
*  Speaking of we did you see this story about the NBA player that got yes
*  Oh my gosh, they suspended it for ten games
*  Because he had an incident a medical edible marijuana incident on a team plane conduct detrimental to the season to the team. Oh
*  It's only an hour flight from Phoenix to LA to oh my god that is he was where he's like the LA he suspended him for ten games
*  They kind of think I was looking the military. They don't want him on the team anymore either. Why he's not
*  I want to say the child maker. I don't know what he's doing
*  But Jamie you just said he's a trouble man doing good without him and he's owed 24 million dollars this year. It's a whole
*  They're trying to box him out
*  Potentially, so it sounds like you save the money on those ten games still you don't have to pay him for those ten
*  Maybe someone does save one eighth two million. Maybe someone does tomorrow
*  People have been asking me all the time. I was on Halloween. I went dancing. I went having fun, you know, and
*  And on the way out so you recognize me they were like
*  People start yelling alright. All right, okay. What's up? They're like, okay, we're all fucked up dude like dose me Ari
*  Someday that'll be funny. Yeah, we're at the bar and some girl was there and I was ordering a drink and then she just goes
*  Like she had her beer. She's just like like that to me
*  You know what I'm picturing right now I'm picturing Bert with headphones on running somewhere on the road listening to us right now
*  so funny goes
*  Some day it'll be funny Bert someday right now. It's not funny
*  You're one of the three of us who's not obese just be happy about fuck
*  What the fuck? I'm not obese. I'm just overweight. No, you're now not obese you
*  Posted on on Instagram. Yes, you were three pounds away from not being obese and you went down. Oh, so
*  98 is what is obese? What's the number? Check out what's you plug in his height for five foot four five foot two
*  Wait, what?
*  Five eight two bum around 200 p.m. I got glitter. Oh, what'd you got down the left now before?
*  I started drinking again. Wow, that's quick. I got down to 195
*  195 there you go. It's night does this sometimes it doesn't let me reach. Oh the government doesn't want no if I'm obese
*  Yeah
*  Putting me it does the age to
*  Don't that doesn't make any sense. Why is it a matter of the age?
*  Yeah, that's a I've never seen change the height it's not I'm not five ten five eight and
*  Change the weight to 200 that's gonna be obese again. I want to see what that is calculate it
*  We'll be the class one weight to one twenty one to one sixty four. That's your has your age in there, too
*  Oh, wait, that's normal weight. No way for the range is 121 to 164. Yeah, but what's just overweight?
*  Put it put it in one put in 187. I
*  Love this I love the BMI calculator overweight over weight 190
*  What would you have to get to to be over one anything one over 165 is gonna be overweight anything over 165?
*  No, no, I want to see what difference in overweight and obese is where that line is
*  Put in 190. I think 190 means you got it
*  190s I'm just overweight 195
*  Okay, so 195 I'm good when I got down there
*  That's where so bird is now not over hits the road is
*  197 197 if you get to 197 you are overweight. Okay. I'm over it has achieved. I'm just overweight
*  I'm somewhere I fluctuate it all depends on one what time I weigh myself to
*  In the morning, it's easy for me to stay around 195. I could do that right now. Okay, or I can pasta it up
*  Yeah, I get pasta it up
*  Just so hard to be consistent like with workouts
*  It's so hard to put in like the real consistent fat-burning time. You're so muscular though
*  Yeah, like a muscular. I don't know how fucking how you lift all that weight around
*  I do it. I force myself
*  Yeah, I understand deterioration that comes with aging. It's very it's one of the most important things for your health as you get older
*  to lift weights, it's very important muscle mass has some sort of
*  There's some sort of correlation between health and muscle mass when you get older. They say that you should do some
*  Resistance exercises and weight-bearing exercises just to keep your bone density and your muscle strong. Yeah
*  My thought is like you're bigger. Yeah, sorry
*  What was your thought my thought is use this fucking thing?
*  Why you got it because you don't see a lot of seven-year-old dudes that can work out hard, right?
*  So what's the point the point is like don't?
*  Work out hard when you're 50 so that when you're 70 you you're still alive like what is that?
*  Oh, well, you like working out. I'm fucking going for it. I'm going for it Ari. I like being exhausted
*  Makes me feel better. I like those 90-minute yoga classes. I like running hills. I like kickboxing. I like jujitsu
*  I like going hard. I like going harder when I can't go hard anymore. Yeah, I'll stop right now. I can still go hard
*  It's amazing that we're friends because I really enjoy the the not moving
*  I don't know how we've enjoyed not moving to
*  Enjoy not moving but I've got caveman jeans, dude. There's this is something inside me. I got a squash
*  Yeah, you're like part K part wild
*  Well, I try to be as nice as possible
*  but there's there's definitely some shit in me especially from my
*  My childhood all my childhood I grew up fighting in martial arts tournaments
*  That is not a good way for your brain to develop with violent combat sports
*  Every day of the week as you develop time you're 15 to the time you're like 22. Just that's not good
*  It's just you can do it with proper guidance and become a nice person and I'm not not down you can but
*  When your whole life is about kicking people unconscious
*  For years it's only about that
*  Yeah, and that's what does also the time when you go into your puberty that's also the time where you're learning about my yard
*  Yeah
*  Yeah. Yeah. So for me, it's like that
*  That door is always open. You got to throw water on that fire all the time
*  You got to get out there with the hose every day. It doesn't matter if you feel like it or not
*  Just don't let that fire grow
*  Don't open up the door to the base
*  They ever just want to strangle somebody in like life. No, no remarkably not I do
*  That's also cuz I do it if you do jujitsu or lift a lot of weights beat beat beat up the punching bag
*  You're the bags part of the but you don't even think sometimes you're like as you pass somebody cuts you off traffic and just like way
*  Too close. You know like I could kill you
*  Well, someone was talking shit and getting mean to me. Yeah, it's very nice to know that you could fuck people
*  It's very nice to know it's very it's very nice
*  Like if you see some guy like some average body dude who thinks he's a badass because he talks shit
*  He's mean and stupid and he might take a swing at you and you see one of those guys
*  It's very good that you are the one who gets to decide what happens
*  Yeah, you know and you can teach someone a very very severe lesson and let them know. Hey motherfucker
*  No, there's people like me out here. I'll break both your arms and leave you here
*  Let me so bad just snap them both crack crack. Good luck. Well, good luck fuckface. Hope you don't lose them
*  There's a lot of mean people out there. I'm a nice guy
*  Nice yeah, so if I run into a mean person, I want to be the one who gets to decide
*  If you're more nice, I get I know I want to be the one who gets to decide somebody gets hurt
*  It's just too many people out there that will just take sucker punches at people and hurt people this I see it all the time
*  Online, right? I'm sure you see it. There's so many videos of people hitting people and doing fucked up things to people for no reason
*  Oh, yes, I mean it was yeah, dude. They knock out videos. Do they not turn an old lady?
*  There's not anybody was an old lady that was waiting in line at like a grocery store
*  It's when he punched her. It was like knock out and then punched her. I
*  Don't remember it. I just remember a video somebody some kid hitting an old lady
*  It's always one person takes too far. It was a horrible one of some kids. They knocked out this guy's
*  He was getting off of a subway
*  I think it was in Chicago and just cracked this guy and he fell
*  Face first out cold on the concrete bounced off the concrete
*  I was like, oh my god, and the guy was old too
*  It wasn't a healthy person like that is something that can literally change the rest of your fucking life
*  These kids are just doing it and laughing and jumping on a train. Whoa. Yeah
*  There was a lot of people doing things like that for a while fucking Harvard kids
*  That's what it is. It's all those Yale fucks. Yeah, know their money and their fucking fancy grades. They want to rebel
*  They go out and crack old people. I
*  See people studying at NYU all the time. It's so weird. I look at them in the library
*  Why is it weird? It's just like a different time of your life. Oh, you're like studying all the time, right?
*  And then the grind. Yeah, it's just like I don't know their colleges
*  Look like they have the whole world ahead of them. It just looks so fucking enviable just learning
*  Well, it is in some ways, but it's also like this is a weird time to go to school
*  You know, yeah, my friends is teacher at a liberal arts college. Well, she's like people just aren't very happy. Yeah, it's all about
*  change and
*  Progress social justice and you can't just have like a fun time. It has to be for a reason
*  Why is what happened there? What happened to having an 80s night party? Can't do that
*  No, yeah culturally appropriate
*  That's right
*  We had it hard you motherfuckers
*  But I mean just not terms like who they're offending but just in terms of like they have to be fighting against something
*  So it's a terrible existence. Are you allowed to dress up as a Civil War soldier if you're from the north?
*  You can't be a Confederate soldier. Are you allowed to get a better soldier that Harkins something?
*  Harkin
*  You can definitely be a Union soldier, right you could be Ulysses S. Grant
*  That's another one. I can see going both ways. I can see somebody going that reminds me of the Civil War, which is my slavery
*  So that's that's hurtful and someone else could be like no
*  I'm honoring the people who fought for freedom and then they're like then they could go back
*  Why is there only the white experience to be able to fight for freedom? Do you realize that if you?
*  Went back in time. Yeah, you around the Civil War. You'd be a giant
*  Just run over people and stomp them because they're all shorter back there so tiny nobody had good food
*  Oh, yeah, in the 1860s
*  I think the average size for a man that was in the army was like 125 pounds
*  Whoa, I could definitely be one of those doctors. I'd be like cut it off
*  Those doctors had it made
*  Nobody made it
*  Cut it off doctor. It's a bloody toe cut it
*  It could get a disease we could all die you got these uh
*  Glass tips glass tips you put them on there or that's part. Oh, they came with it
*  Third tallest average in the world at the time was five seven
*  During the Civil War for American man third tallest average. Yeah, what does that mean?
*  That means like the first average is like six feet tallest like the tallest average average tallest person third tallest was five foot seven
*  I don't understand what you mean the average like if they like there's an average. What's the average the tallest average height?
*  I got the peak what is it is a six foot five? Yeah average for all the year average for the people that are alive
*  So what year would that be 1866 Civil War time period the average is five seven
*  That was the third highest third highest height average that we've ever had
*  No during that time. What do you mean? That was the people that lived during that time during 1866
*  That was the third highest average average so if you had first highest average like I mean first highest average
*  Well the average height of people what is the highest like for example?
*  England could have been higher than no no this you could have percentages like you have
*  30 like say if you have
*  People say if you have only have 90 people right? Yeah, it's just the average 30 of them are six foot one and above
*  30 of them are six foot one to five foot ten
*  30 of them are five foot seven to five foot ten
*  What are you choosing the 30 30 30 it's just the average
*  No, no, no the average height right but the number of humans the overall number of humans
*  So you know I'm saying that what I said, that's why I broke it down to 90 right
*  So you have three groups if you have 90 people if it was the third highest average like we're the third tallest in the world
*  They're even do you understand what I'm saying?
*  All right listen hold on stop. I got this third percent. Listen there even if we have 90 people
*  30 and 30 and 30 right if that's what you have okay, then that's obviously the third
*  They're almost even in the numbers that are represented by each individual category of height
*  So it's five ten to six foot two is one group. That's 30 people
*  Why those 30 because you're 30?
*  I'm just saying this so you can understand what the third highest percentage means
*  It's based on the number of overall people so if there's 200
*  So there's only three percent groups or there five or ten instead of 90 people. Let's say there's 90 million people
*  Yeah, okay. Well 30 million of them are five foot
*  What's the fifth highest percentage what we'd have to find that out?
*  But there's every no highest percentage was five foot seven which means that out of these millions of people that were alive back then
*  The top third was the average this the second third average this and the third third average that the low such a confusing stat
*  No fucking way. You might be confused on the word third. It's not a third. It's third place
*  Third place for average male in America
*  That's why you're not getting it. We're now at 37th as of today
*  Americans United States, but you're talking about the average height was that for America in 1866 American soldiers
*  We're tall by the standards at the time for
*  His country, but people were so tiny back then that third highest height the third highest category was five foot seven
*  We would just the rank third country we were the third of all that
*  I'm confused on why you guys are not on the same page here. I think you're both saying the same thing
*  Third grouping of people averages five seven
*  I thought you were saying without you were saying average height of people in
*  1966 the third average height of people was five foot seven. Is that what you're saying?
*  Wait wait wait wait wait is this what you're saying? Yes America ranked third of all the countries
*  Yes, that's what it is and we were average height five seven at the time
*  The average height of a male was five seven the third tallest males in the world today. It is 37th
*  Well, that's a confusing stat
*  Yeah, it is we ranked third of all the countries Americans were five foot seven on average
*  But the average height in nineteen eighteen sixty six was five foot seven. They do that. I guarantee you that's food
*  Nobody had any goddamn women were five three
*  People starved to death back then probably a lot. It probably was a lot
*  Today and if everybody's that little it's the same genes. How the fuck is in a hundred years plus
*  What is 150 years? How do people get so much bigger? How do you get those great?
*  I'll tell thank you months here to no one gives it up
*  When you stand next to someone like Alistair over him or someone yeah, how do you make?
*  Holland big old Dutch dude, how do you get that? How does someone get that big? Those are the Vikings, right? Oh, yeah Rico Verhoeven
*  He's the glory heavyweight kickboxing champion. It's breeding. He's
*  Fucking giant breeding. That's how you get a giant by the tallest fucked adult. Oh, exactly. That's how you get a Brock Lesnar
*  Yeah shit isn't magic. It's real simple the conquerors fuck all the hottest women and then they make babies and then in
*  2015
*  That is basically what it is man. It's a German Shepherd's and chihuahuas and you have that kind of like red band
*  That's to me why CRISPR is so fascinating. What's CRISPR CRISPR is gene editing technology that they're they're currently using on live human beings
*  Now they're doing the first test now on live human beings. Yeah, it's gene editing technology. They came up with but
*  boy, I know I'm gonna butcher this but they it's a tool that they recognize that
*  Bacteria carry like certain signals and they figured out how to
*  edit genes
*  Using what they learned from how bacteria carry these signals
*  I know I'm butchering this but they're getting better and better with the tools and they're getting to a point where they're able to isolate
*  Certain genes like in China. They were able to give people HIV
*  avoidance
*  Resistance to HIV and it
*  But it also had some sort of a positive effect on their intelligence
*  Well, that's two for one and is yeah, there's a bunch of weird like good
*  But I think that's speculated but there's a bunch of weird chain reaction things. They're not entirely certain
*  Oh, yeah, that's why they're saying it's unethical. Yeah, just experiment on people, but they're doing you have your ethics
*  I'm gonna have a super kid. You're gonna have a super kid. Someone's gonna have a goddamn incredible
*  Hope you enjoy your ethics while my kid fucking smashes your village
*  Well, you once a country decides they're gonna pull the trigger on super people. Everyone else has to keep up
*  Do you imagine what it's like the troops is trying 20 troops?
*  What if all porn by the year 2050 is Chinese guys with giant hogs? Oh, it's all because that's all they are
*  There's another world. I want to live in every Chinese guy is seven foot tall and they'll have a giant hog
*  Wow, they're like we're sick of this and we're sick of it
*  Revenge they're all seven feet tall. How's it feel now giant Brock Lesnar bones and huge hogs like like
*  12 year old kids legs and they're just banging everything that moves
*  They're just fucking their way through the world
*  I mean once if one country pulls the trigger and they decide they're gonna make super people
*  Everyone would have to catch up. Everyone would have to catch up
*  But it's almost like the internet right if we said hey, we can't allow people to communicate openly and freely
*  We can't allow an even distribution of all the information in the world
*  It's just too much power that we're just giving away to people. We got to stop this
*  We got it. We got to make this only for a few people if they did that
*  What would what which the world would fucking be a totally different place but they didn't do that and if someone doesn't
*  Stop them before they make super people
*  They say listen we can't do this super people because then there's gonna be everyone's gonna be a super person and no one is gonna be
*  No one's gonna have body issues. No one's good because everyone's gonna be perfect. Yeah, we got we can't
*  We'll find other ways to like your eyebrows are too big. I don't like the way your nostrils flare
*  Yeah, and then everybody would be a super person. Yeah, that'd be great
*  That's a hundred percent possible. That's that's within a hundred years
*  They're probably gonna be able to engineer most things about people unless something catastrophic happens to us
*  Do you remember that Van Damme movie? Which one was a soldier?
*  Oh, no, you know Universal Soldier is that what it was about? Yeah
*  I was just like looking at the thing that genetically augmented soldiers with enhanced self-healing abilities and superior strength
*  Yeah, yeah, that would be in John Claude Van Damme ahead of his motherfucking time
*  He had a scene in timecop
*  Do you remember there was like a scene where he went back in time with a machine gun was fucking people up
*  Like in the Civil War days or something like that. Do you remember that?
*  Or somebody else did didn't see that movie. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah somebody else did that's what it was
*  Somebody else in timecop was like a bad cop. I think they went back and did bad things
*  They were like going back and stealing gold and shit and coming back with the gold. Yes the guy he's going after
*  That's right. So that dude see if you find the video in Civil War in Georgia. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Civil War. This is fucking great
*  because I've always thought like man how cool would it be to go back in time like to the
*  you know any any time and you know, the fucking the history of the Spartans and
*  And see somebody show up out of nowhere with a machine gun
*  So he's asking these people
*  Asking for the gold and they pull out their gun and he's just fucking guns them down two fists with machine guns or
*  Laser beams didn't shoot the horses though interesting now
*  Amazing accuracy very good must have trained. Yeah, I probably trained didn't look like it though
*  Didn't look like he had like real solid tactical training with the use that but that was that scene
*  I was thought like that would be a cool scene in a movie do and they wonder our lives
*  We sit here and talk talk shit everybody you it's like that's our jobs now
*  Yeah, and then you just do stand up at night. Yeah, we just have our own fucking stupid radio shows. You just do acid
*  Would you do?
*  It's crazy. Yeah, you make a pay rent off your fucking ads. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's amazing
*  It's way better than a job job. Oh my god, but people ask me. Why do I keep telling people to do it?
*  That's why to do what to do podcasts. Yeah, and people you told too many people do podcast why so there's more choice
*  Are you fucking elitist cunt? Don't be silly
*  Everybody should do this. You should if you're listening to me and you're upset that I'm saying it's probably because you need to do your own
*  Podcasts, you know, I'm right. That's just
*  Not everybody should do podcast
*  Don't yeah, you're like not everybody should be but a lot of people could a lot of people could it's a viable job option
*  That's all I'm saying. It's a job option. You can control yourself. Just cuz you're very you think everybody fuck do it
*  You got lucky you got in early all those you won't be this big but like a fun time
*  Anything can happen. You just sit around talking shit you fucking record it. Yeah. Yeah, dude. It's amazing. It's amazing
*  Yeah, and this is a it's also a lot like the internet and nobody saw this coming
*  Nobody thought like the biggest broadcast shows gonna be something that someone just does on their own
*  Yeah, you know look at these Logan Paul guys like that guy just fought he had a boxing match
*  That was the headline dead body
*  Yes, yeah that guy he it was the headline of an event the Staples Center Wow. Yes. He fought. Yes
*  Live streaming on the zone. Whoa, I bet a lot of people watch it too. I wonder how many people watch that thing
*  The zone you know what that is. It's a it's a streaming app
*  it has all the big major fights on it a lot of the big boxing matches like Tyson Fury's fights and
*  What is is Canelo Alvarez on that too, I think he is yeah, there's a lot of like top-level
*  Andy Ruiz the heavyweight champ he's on that too. So all these guys and it's like X amount per month

*  I get on to twitch or something. No way
*  That is hilarious
*  I'm trying to find the actual numbers. I haven't found 11,000 that is hilarious
*  What a crazy way to show a fight does he get an extra credit for that?
*  Coolness point. Yeah for sure, but
*  Like you can he can he get in trouble for that? Yeah, I mean it's he's rebroadcasting that supposed to do that
*  I know but this is a whole art project. I say it's fucking allowed. Yeah, it's an inch. He's making it new enough
*  You're not really watching that for the actual action. You do want to see that what happens sure
*  Projects. Yeah, but he's stealing. I
*  disagree
*  artistic license
*  What's next what do you see I think AGI glasses
*  Reality
*  AGR why don't I even make up that acronym?
*  Apple ones just got pushed two years. So there's a rumor to come out really like sometime soon
*  But yeah, this pushed it took 2022 right now. No those they have some for people
*  Don't know if it's for series specifically but Alexa
*  Glasses now they're like sunglasses that have all time built-in while you're wearing it. You can talk to Alexa that was
*  Too much fuck off. They need to take some Russian scientists
*  They need to bring them a Steve Jobs grave and bring them back to life off. They need to re
*  Reinvigorate him reanimate him and have him run Apple again from the grave. Yeah with no soul just ruthless
*  He was the man's he was
*  The man's innovation to some giant robot nuclear you can't make everybody you can't record everybody it's fucking bullshit
*  You can't have a fucking thing that's gonna record you right? I can't decide that for people around me
*  That's to be totally legal. It should be bullshit, but it's gonna happen fuck that almost no one signed up for this
*  We don't sign up for this the rest of us didn't sign up for it and we're still having to deal with it
*  That's true. Do you remember those Google glasses? Yes, and we were all like fuck take those off people got beat up
*  They like get that shit out of here. It's like having a cell phone in someone's face the whole time
*  No one likes that. No nobody likes that. That's not cool and just people just have that all the time
*  No one feels safe. No, that should be illegal
*  They should not let that be and no one could tell if you had it recording or not
*  No, exactly and we didn't sign up for it. Yeah, you want to do it around your house? That's fine
*  That shit should be illegal. But what do you do if China with their super dick dudes all of a sudden has glasses?
*  Huawei gets into the company you do that over there
*  Bring them over here. We don't even know it because we're so fucking ignorant because we do we lost just like the stem cell race
*  We got behind the curve
*  Yeah, maybe maybe that's always a good one that people like to say well we got behind the curve with stem cells
*  Joe, let's motion DMT right now. Yeah, I don't have any here but fuck that's not a thing to do to make a good podcast
*  You don't think so? No, it'd be 30 minutes of boring
*  KSI for 30 minutes Logan Paul had more pay-per-view buys and Anthony Joshua versus Andy Weas. Wow Eddie Hearn
*  Holy shit had about a million or maybe more. That's a lot for a streaming. Here's a lot of people coming
*  Dude, that's a lot. I didn't know that you get that many for a streaming service
*  The thing is so many people have these streaming services now so many people do
*  It's um, this is 1.2 million. It did that's a lot man. Well, that's a lot. That's huge
*  Oh, I'm sorry. The first fight did that this one got more this way. He fought twice Logan Paul. Yeah a year ago
*  It was a amateur fight that time and this is a professional fight. Yeah, it's professional six round fight
*  And it was the headliner of a card where Billy Joe Saunders fight Billy Joe Saunders one of the best fighters in the world
*  He's an elite fighter world champion. He defended his title on the undercard of two YouTube guys fighting now
*  How much of an insult is that for him? I'm sure he's just like I'm getting paid
*  Views to more views it's good for him. Wow, that's crazy. What a killer. It's all about the fucking dollar
*  Nobody gives a shit about the art
*  Do the two youtubers fighting? Yeah, there's no art, right? I mean, there's there's some art to it, right?
*  It's a creation. There's some drama a lot of shits going down. Yeah, but I'm saying the other guy's a fucking bill
*  Just honestly, how about it for him? People don't know who he is. You didn't know he is. I know you do see it's like
*  It's good. I won by knockout. He won by knockout. So it was good good showcase for him. He's a vicious
*  He should have challenged Logan Paul next. Oh, he'll kill you're like I was a winner of this fight
*  I'll make a lot more money. No
*  They're not the same weight class. Billy Joe Saunders is like one or two. I think he's light heavyweight
*  What is he? Is he super middleweight? Google what he is
*  I think Billy Joe Saunders beat him with his right arm tied behind his back. It wouldn't be fair at all
*  It'd be horrible, but that guy's an elite world champion boxer and Logan Paul had one fight
*  Splint on his leg right arm tied behind his back
*  You know, it'll be Logan Paul. Someone did that Jason Ellis is so crazy. He had a fight where
*  Who did he do it with
*  Shane Carlin, that's right. Oh my god, that makes it even more crazy. That's right
*  Shane Carlin who's one of the biggest punching heavyweights in the history of the fucking sport
*  He made Shane Carlin tape his arm to his body. Look at this
*  So he's got his right arm taped to his body and he's just blasted him with left hands
*  And dude Shane Carlin was a fucking murderer
*  Murderer do this is such a ridiculous idea for
*  so much lighter
*  To the guys a giant oh my god, he hasn't even really tried to hit him yet
*  Do when I was taking jujitsu in Boulder, yeah, um, I was on the mat. He just got left. This is
*  Needs man. He scooped him up for some reason at one point time just to joke around to pick him up
*  but when I was there I was
*  Training at
*  Their jujitsu school and this guy walked in there as there's a left hook fucking
*  terrible idea
*  Yeah, look at that. Watch that punch again. He's so big man. He's so big one backed it up a little bit
*  Look at this. Oh
*  Right on up he's just trying until he got him. He's so there's a little bit of movement
*  Separation he's just way too strong way way way way way way way too strong
*  Damn anyway that guy walked in when I was doing jujitsu. I was rolling. I was like
*  I was like, it's not a cartoon person. What is that? He was at the time. He's probably close to 300 pounds
*  He's so big. It's ridiculous, dude. He's got like a body arms like where your body is. That's his arms and for
*  Ellis be so crazy. Did you willing to have a boxing match with that?
*  Roots I get it. He's a fighter with jackass roots fuck all that noise
*  You can get some never-ending headaches, would you fight now?
*  What I know no, there's no money listening to what I'm saying
*  I know but like not one of those guys
*  Some of the celebrities too many people that are having real problems with their head really
*  Yes, a lot of fighters like post-career are having real struggles. It's not it's no joke, man
*  You gotta know when to stop and head injuries are that about head gear
*  That's worse head gear doesn't help head gear makes your head like a bigger target
*  It's easier to hit and then also when you get hit it acts
*  It's like it's unnatural fulcrum all this fucking weight on your head. Yeah, I think you're the thing about it is you're trying to avoid cuts
*  That's what head gear is good for it's good for your avoiding cut
*  Okay, but you can get fucked up with a punch or a kick wearing head gear damn big gloves help a little bit
*  Yeah, big gloves still get your fucking brains rattled
*  I talk about having a fight, but he won't fight me. No, don't get your brains rattled dude won't be me
*  I guess he's worried about himself
*  About hurting himself. Yeah getting hurt. Yeah, his mom's worried about it, too
*  What are you trying to say? You trying to talk shit say his mom's worried about him
*  No, I know he loves him and he's worried about it. She's worried about him
*  You're gonna fuck him up. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, I think that's overall
*  I'm just trying to figure out what's going on. I've been trying to find him. He won't find me
*  Why do you want to fight him you guys work together? Yeah, I know but he's talking about this fight forever
*  And he won't fight me. He's gonna fight me. He's gonna fight me
*  Yeah, I know but he's talking about this fight forever and he won't fight me forever. Yeah, you would do this
*  I know you would. Yeah, for sure. Do you think you would fight high or sober?
*  Probably high. Probably high is a good one. No, I don't know maybe I trained high all the time with Eddie he encouraged it
*  Yeah, always. It's great. Would you um, I might show mercy if I was high that'd be a negative. Bare knuckle bare knuckle you think?
*  I was not thinking about it. I was thinking the big gloves, but that's probably one way to go
*  I don't think bare knuckle now. Bare knuckle. Open hand like combat. Slap fight. Slap fight.
*  That's a good way to get poked in the eye. Trust me. See Lewis sent to break his hand slap fighting Jay. Did he really? He broke his hand? I think so
*  I think so. Where'd he hit it?
*  Jay's got a giant head. Jay's got one. He went real hard. Super wide. He's got a super wide
*  Yeah, he's got big bones that Jay. Yeah, how was Legion of Skanks? You went on finally. It was fun.
*  We were so high though dude and it was the day after Sober October was over
*  Blitz, Screeged and they kept rolling blunts and passing around and I was and I had to pronounce some Russian names two hours later
*  You know for the way. Yeah, I do the way and it's two hours later. So this is them slap fighting. Jeremiah. Oh him and Jeremiah
*  That's when he broke his hand. Oh
*  Jeremiah just lit him up
*  Look at the serious Jeremiah. Jeremiah changed stance. He knows how to use that fucking reach. He goes for the block too. He goes backhanded
*  Oh, he's toying with him
*  Well, dude, Jeremiah slapped him. Oh my god. Oh shit
*  Lewis when he fake boxes he touches you. Where did Jeremiah learn how to box?
*  From fucking Catholic school, I think. The streets of Kansas somewhere. Yeah for real
*  He just hit a slap cattle on the fucking. Where do you think he learned? Lewis is outclassed by this 130 pounder
*  He's bigger than that. Oh, that's a good one. Lewis is 280
*  Dude, this is a slap fight. This is a real slap fight. This is a real slap fight
*  Yeah, this isn't like some guys playing silly
*  Wow, he's not knocked out but you got fucked up Gomez. He got cracked. Oh, that's the kind of fighting that got your dad stabbed to death
*  Legion of skank slap boxing. Oh my god
*  Let me tell you something you can get KO'd slap boxing don't get confused look at him
*  He just had a fight that was like a fight fight. He flew out for this. He flew out for a slap
*  I mean they had some of the shit going on. Wait, is this round two? Are they gonna round two?
*  What? I didn't know what like this. Um, keep going, please. What are you doing? Why are you shutting this off?
*  I'm not. Let it roll. Oh my god. Look at this
*  I
*  Mean Lewis is so serious right now. Well what Jeremiah is doing? I mean, what's he doing? What's he doing?
*  He's waiting. He's putting his hand out there. He's pawing and Lewis throws these combination and Jeremiah's waiting
*  He's catching him. He's catching him as he was coming in. Would you compare some to Anderson Silver a little bit a little bit?
*  The way he's like baiting counter fighting. Yeah, he's counter fighting and he's also being very smart with his defense
*  And Lewis got a little feel for that right hand a little worried about that right hand. He doesn't want it
*  That thing's coming down. It's a good he's got a good reach tactic. He also keeps blocking on the side that Jeremiah's not touching him
*  Which is oh
*  Lewis can't help but want to close his fist. Yeah, I mean again real close. Jeremiah's circling. That's a good move as well
*  But Lewis is closing the distance. He looks very angry. He's serious. He's going back to his roots. Oh
*  Got Jeremiah on that one. He's getting very aggressive. Jeremiah might be losing steam. Oh, he's taking big reaches
*  Is it the round over? The round's over? There's another round after this. How is Jeremiah doing this?
*  Yeah, there's gotta be one more. Oh keep it moving, please. Let's see the next round
*  They go four and it goes on for at least a minute. Oh my god. So they just kept doing rounds
*  Look, he's got his back turned and shit
*  This is hilarious
*  These guys are I'm so glad these guys are alive
*  They're so ridiculous, yeah, yeah, they're they're pushing wild comedy dude
*  I never go as far as I go on Legion of Skanks. Of course not. It's just such an open environment for doing whatever
*  It's also in support of like like I said wild comedy like you need that
*  Wow, you need that you need to gather around and balance things out. Obviously people love it
*  Oh my god, Jeremiah's so lanky. He's taking big long swings
*  Lewis is relaxing a little bit more now and he's starting to use some technique. That was some nonsense right there
*  It looked like he just punched him in the stomach. He looks like he's closing his fist every time
*  He smacked him hard in the head with that right hand
*  Jab, you can't jab and slap. Oh my god, Jeremiah got him twice. Yeah, you can slap. I mean you can jab
*  Oh, Lewis just smacked him. Lewis. Oh, he went to the body with a punch dude. He's punching
*  Dude it seems like he's is he slapping to the body or is he punching to the body? He can't help it
*  He's an oaf. He's uneducated which is a lot of his problem. He thinks that's his problem. What books would you recommend to him?
*  What? What books would you recommend to him?
*  Timmy the Turtle plays soccer. Oh, he just got lit up with that right hand dude. He got lit up
*  He got lit up. Oh my god, Jeremiah's in the backtracking. He's trying hard to come at
*  Of course the round is over and Lewis is still punching. What a fucking trash oaf
*  Wow, is that it?
*  I mean he won that fight. He's on he's got Jeremiah in his heels. Jeremiah won the first round
*  Second round I say it was a wash. Well, definitely not. I didn't judge it
*  No, people are saying one more round. Okay, what does it say?
*  Jeremiah takes it. Wow. I can see it. It was all who room went to
*  Wow, well listen he did crack him with some big shots. It was all basically
*  Round two and that was close big shots. Look at Jeremiah
*  Slap boxing people that looks painful as fuck like his face is raw. Oh my god
*  They might have to have a rematch. Listen, just let me tell you something about slapping people in the face
*  Slapping people the face is open hands open hands hitting your eyeball
*  You're gonna scratch your fucking eye and you're gonna have a real eye injury. That's not a good technique
*  I'm not saying don't do it. You do whatever you want
*  But I want you to know that open hand slapping and reaching like that. You just ask as someone has seen
*  Probably 500 people get poked in the eye up close
*  You're gonna get poked in the eye. I'd agree. That is the best way to incapacitate someone don't do it though. And what don't do that
*  No, don't don't do that. Don't do that if you need to win
*  Use those like I like your technique block goggles. There's little slits to block your eyes
*  That's a good way to get those things whacked off your head nails out too
*  See and shave those maybe if you had some eye goggles like legit little welding goggles or some shit some scuba goggles
*  There you go
*  But then it would almost be worse for you because it will fuck with your peripheral
*  If you didn't get used to slapping people when you have things on that's one thing
*  I always hated about headgear you put them on you can't see things here and here good your window of uh,
*  Your field of view gets narrowed. Yeah, it becomes a problem when you get close. You don't see where punches are coming
*  You don't see what's the goggles? Yeah headgear. You don't see what kicks are coming. You don't see things coming
*  So I would think that would be the same thing with those goggles. Yeah, what about swimmers goggles?
*  I think they would still fuck a lot of yeah, that would fuck up a lot
*  It would fuck with your peripheral all those things would fuck with your peripheral. Yeah, no way
*  You don't see anything coming
*  But unless you trained with them on if you trained with them on maybe you could do it
*  But also more used to but it still cuts you down
*  They could also just touch your goggles with their face and they would get their sweat all over your goggles
*  And then you wouldn't be able to see as good another good technique
*  Yeah, they're both wearing goggles though. So it's fair but they would both do that. It would fuck you up
*  You wouldn't be able to see that good. Wouldn't you wipe it? You wouldn't see what what's in front of you. Good luck
*  Let's just fight
*  Let's just cut the shit and put some gloves on and fight you're gonna do that if we're gonna slap fight. Let's just
*  Let's just fight. I want to be able to take you down strangle you. This is nonsense for salmon
*  In the eye and smear smear in each other's fucking
*  Goggles, you think we've been in a just straight through jits if I between you and louis because he thinks him
*  That's hilarious
*  He's watched over 100 ufc fights
*  He's a big fellow though. He is so fat probably get good at it. Yeah, he's a big tough guy lay on you
*  He's weight 330. He's lost a little shit load away. That's a lot. He's lost over 20 pounds
*  No, he's not that big. Oh, he's back. He's ballooned
*  Are you trying to start a fight with him? I am not i'm just saying he has ballooned
*  I was guessing a high weight at soda special when he taped it
*  I was like what you think I said what are you like 240 and goes like 250
*  I was like I was guessing high. I thought it'd be 220. Jesus. That's a big fella. Yeah
*  But he's big period like that guy just
*  You know if he died it down and got ripped he's still 215 220 pounds a big fella. Yeah, he lost 45 pounds. He'd be 215
*  Is he that big?
*  He was big coach
*  I don't know
*  Sometimes you like don't realize people just get like suddenly big what's with his glasses
*  Why is he wearing yellow glasses everywhere? Is that his new thing? He has a you know, some guys have a thing
*  He's always looking for a thing
*  And well the big j took it from dice the weightlifting gloves. That's big j's homage people don't know that
*  That's his homage to dice clay. Really? Yeah, the weightlifting gloves big j's a giant dice fan. He loves them giant dice fan
*  Yeah, who isn't dude? I brought dice to meet uh j
*  We're a roof party on july 4th this year
*  Yeah, I think this year so a couple months ago, yeah, maybe yeah november
*  Yeah, that sounds about right could have been a year ago, but I think this year
*  And so I was like you don't even know. Yeah, it's time. You know how it works
*  But like uh, I was like hey come meet me that my friend jay wants to meet you
*  And then who were just up on the roof like jake. Can you meet somebody who's talking?

*  Really point time, but I don't remember what happened. I probably dropped the ball chef kumya and dice doing dice offs
*  They're friends, right? Yeah, they're friends
*  I know they had a thing for a while that's squashed. That was one of the best feuds. That's a good
*  Radio feuds radio feuds were great. He would do radio feuds on purpose, but dice would get into feuds
*  Yeah on purpose. Yeah, so much of it was like theater people don't know he committed crazy shit
*  He commits so hard remember when he had those comics acting out some movie that he was filming with his vhs camera the never-ending dice movie
*  That he'd edit by the way, he'd edit by like say stop and he rewind and press pause right there and start recording from there
*  Yes, you couldn't go back and edit. You just decide where you cut out
*  Forward backwards forward backwards. Oh stop that guy's about to punch you now. You be mid-punch. This is after he had sold out like what?

*  He had us he made us come into these and like beat each other up. Oh my god

*  He was about to get a new phone and so on radio he goes
*  Hey my old phone numbers he didn't say old phone number goes my phone number is this
*  And he goes give me a call. I'll talk to you and people start talking to him and calling him
*  He said come come my car look at it. He turned it on as soon as he turned it on just starts ringing
*  People are calling non-stop. They go. Hello. Yeah. Yeah, it's me
*  uh
*  He got this one guy where he started calling the guy back
*  And then he started like bothering the guy oh my god
*  He would call him at work
*  And he'd be like, oh, it's just andrew
*  The guy's like dice after talking to him his dream was to talk to dice and now dice a week later
*  He's like i'm at work right now. I really can't so what kind of work you're doing right now. What is it?
*  Was that just bothering him until the guy was like avoiding his call?
*  But just for the goof that would be the thing that gets his gear spinning
*  But that would be it. I know what I want to do. Yeah
*  Like that that would be what he wants to do
*  He would you'd either be the butt of the joke or he'd have somebody else watching him. Oh, yeah
*  Classic human and just love them all the time
*  And it's like even to this day
*  He's still doing it if someone's in the back steps of the comedy store and let's say you're a fan
*  But let's say you're standing straight up and i'm two steps up. He can't see you. I don't think you got in focus
*  Okay, so i'm two steps you're standing up i'm standing up i'm two steps i'm on a step you're like oh dice nice to meet you
*  Do you do that? Hey dice nice to meet you. Oh, yeah. Nice to meet you, too

*  Yeah, that's great. I think guys like that. Okay, sure. I see you and then he slipped down and just ask if it's all we saw that
*  Jesus
*  God
*  He's crazy. Yeah, he's a legit always in it for the goof
*  He's a legit character, right?
*  His message I remember realizing at some point I didn't have to grow up in this business like I still have thoughts of like
*  Even though i'm not going to be a lawyer like but like that's still the direction i'm supposed to head, you know
*  It's like we should be distinguished. Yeah or something
*  If you change your behavior, yeah, like it's gonna happen
*  I'm gonna become an adult and then I heard i called dice and his answering machine was
*  That's guy in his mid-50s right and i'm like, oh maybe I don't have to grow up
*  Maybe I could just be like fucking whatever
*  Like I never changed. I don't think you have to grow up
*  I think people will put pressure on you because they have to grow up
*  They're like why don't you have to grow up enablers? Yeah, as long as you're paying your bills
*  As long as you're paying your taxes, you know as long as you're not
*  You know, you're not a deadbeat dad keep child abuse to a minimum
*  You said that
*  So you're not saying your minimum is I don't understand as long as you're
*  A good person who gives a shit if you grow up. Yeah, what is happening? What are we doing?
*  We have a finite time here
*  We're deciding we want people to behave in a certain way all you want people just don't be an asshole
*  Doesn't matter if you grow up or not grow up
*  Yeah, these guys like dice are having a great fucking time ever see somebody like one day he's gonna die
*  And I hope he dies in the middle of a prank and I hope people don't realize
*  That would make him happy make him so nice stays dead and everyone just kept waiting
*  Well, what else what's the option? What's option number two? Nobody's living forever folks. It's not happening
*  This is as good as it gets
*  I will tell you if dice dies on stage and you're a comic in the area and you have at some point people start to realize
*  Oh fuck. This is not a prank. You know, yeah if you get up there and realize he's dead, right? You should say
*  What? Oh, okay, and then stand up like it's fucking gag and then just leave it up there for a while longer
*  Yeah, see how long you keep it going. He would have wanted it that way
*  Yeah
*  I think so. Yeah
*  For sure, yeah
*  Yeah, he's nuts
*  He's the best
*  He's just funny that's just a way to live he made norton and and and uh, and um florentine introduce him like they go into a
*  Subway sandwich shop and they're like ladies and gentlemen avert your eyes. The legend is coming in and then he was like walk in
*  To a subway sandwich shop. That's hilarious. Yeah, that'd be a great show
*  You have just dice on the road and someone announces him like that everywhere he goes
*  Yeah peasants, please the legend clear the floor
*  He banned me from his house for a year once what'd you do? I didn't do anything. Did you dose his kids?
*  I did not. I would never do that
*  Mostly i'm scared of dice
*  He said he had a gun in his in his uh
*  Destroying I was like no you don't no way
*  You would never have around your kids because I do and he said he'd bet me $200 and i'm like, you know
*  I don't have $200. I can't make that bet
*  And he goes all right. Well, I do
*  And then he's all left his thing and goes don't look in there. I'm like, i'm not gonna look in there
*  I'm like i'm not gonna look in there. He goes don't fucking look in there and I won't and then freddy soto fucking fuck face freddy
*  Soto told him I was just in the office told him that I went into his drawer
*  He said I was rifling through his drawers and dice like that's it
*  It's a lie. It was a lie by freddy soto and dice like you're out you're banned from the house
*  Couldn't go to barbecues anymore. Yeah
*  I was rifling through his affairs, which never happened dice. I never did that. I was in the room
*  Why do you think freddy did that?
*  Well, of course because of that reason because he's that because he got me banned he wanted to get you banned
*  Yeah, why do you think freddy would want to get you banned?
*  I think he was jealous of my upbringing and how I had a foosball table at home
*  And it always bothered him that he didn't have that growing up in texas interesting
*  Maybe i'm not sure but the point is I never wrote through his affairs. You know what bert said once it was really freaky
*  Yeah, it was high too. So don't take this with a grain of salt
*  Bert goes, I don't think you ever die
*  I go what are you talking about? People die. He goes prove it
*  You haven't died
*  I don't think you die
*  Prove it's a good one though. Here's the thing
*  Prove it's a good like meh good point sort of yeah, but what are you saying then?
*  Like i've had enough people come on this podcast that have you semi convinced that you're living in some sort of simulation
*  What does he think happens? That's a good question
*  What do you think he thinks happens when the when he has seen bodies no longer have life in him, right? Right, but that's not you
*  It's not him
*  So those people are all just the players
*  I don't know. I don't know what he's saying. Is he saying he's the he's the only thing in the universe
*  I've heard that theory or is he saying like none of us die
*  what if
*  Everyone was the only person in their own universe and everyone's universe intersects with other people's universes
*  and that
*  You think that the universe you exist in is the same as the one that I exist in because we hang out together
*  Yeah, but the actual universe in your world is
*  Revolved around you and in your world
*  My roles are me cut pitch and move real quick. Yes, once one guy becomes realizes that he's in that
*  He's able to travel to other universes has to kill the one person from each universe. That's the real person
*  Yes time travel space travel one will find him. Yeah
*  Is that another movie from john clark?
*  But there's a movie coming out. It's uh
*  It's been made I believe or they're finishing it now
*  It's coming out next year with ryan reynolds where he plays an npc character in a video game that realizes he's
*  Oh, yeah
*  And like oh whatever hilarity ensues. Oh, that's fun. It's a comedy. I don't know exactly
*  Yeah, I remember the npc
*  Player character. Yeah, that's like the ultimate nerd diss, right?
*  They call someone an npc that means you're just like a dead on just like a walking like walking into a wall
*  Yeah, it's got pulling nails out of wood. Yeah, by the way, if anyone makes that movie you're welcome to we both give you permission
*  Yeah, go ahead. We want tickets to the premiere. Yeah, that's all we want and say is based on a conversation between ari chafir and joe rogan
*  The joe rogan experience and um ari chafir's taping of his new
*  Motherfucking comedy special will be february 8th
*  New york manhattan right near washington square park at the square ball center and arrythegreat.com
*  I think i turn on for tickets. I'll post on my twitter my instagram and um and dude

*  We would joke around sometimes about you was like
*  Like you would it was like especially when we do tag team when you're introducing people. It's like you're fucking already done
*  Yeah, I don't want to get out of there out
*  He's great he's great. It's great. I'll join words. I'll do i'll make four into two
*  Sometimes i'll get seven into three that's a that's a punch trunk thing too, you know, you think i'm punch. No
*  I don't think you are but that's I know you're not in fact, but some people who are one of things is they start slurring their words together
*  They said my learning disabilities
*  Hey, they're all of them. They all sound the same like they started talking about like yeah
*  They can't get their mouth to move as fast as their brain something's wrong. There's there's yeah, this shit's not firing right
*  Brain damage son. That's what we were talking about earlier. I know too many people that have been hit in the head
*  It's just
*  After a while man
*  And the thing is you can retire now and you start getting headaches like three four years from now
*  Thing depression might set in five six years from now. Yeah, seven eight years from now. You might have memory issues
*  It's not a simple like as soon as you're done like here you are right now
*  Like as if you stop fighting like right now today, you're like, I think I stopped fighting in a good time
*  I got my faculties. I'm all fine right now
*  Maybe but maybe all the times you've been hit over those years leading up to that is going to start to kick in years from now
*  That's why you see some fighters. They're fine when they retire
*  But then you see them 10 years after they retire and you can barely understand the word they're saying
*  That's what's going on there. That's when it's kicking in
*  People die of heart disease like years after they stop doing coke. Is that true? Yeah, that makes sense. It's their hearts just got weaker
*  Yeah, that makes sense
*  I long for the day when they figure out how to
*  Revitalize brains when they figure out how to whether it's through stem cells or snorting stem cells snorting it. Yeah
*  You have to suck one of those chinese guys giant monster dick and that's where the best stem cells are
*  You imagine that was the only way to fix tbi you had to suck a giant
*  They engineer the dick. That's right. Yeah, we have a cure
*  And also a catch we've shot it right into these monster cocks
*  That would be the chinese porn film with these guys that would be the debut
*  The only way to cure brain damage would be you'd have to suck one of their cocks and get these old football players
*  Their bad knees have to suck these giant chinese cocks and they're like what if but what if sucking this cock the act of it
*  Gave me more depression and then be like well, so no no, no, the cure is so good. It's so yummy
*  You're gonna love it. You're gonna want to suck all the cocks. It's like the first
*  What's hard is like just go ahead and jump in the queue
*  Just get in there and suck that cock. The first one is the biggest one. Once you're already a cocksucker
*  What are you worried about? Just suck suck to your heart's content now. He's happy because it tastes good. The shame's gone. It's over
*  Yeah, and it cures all of his brain damage
*  Fixes his knees treatments all the time. You'd have women like botox women that are addicted to it
*  You would have that imagine if that's where all of the best stem cells came from
*  They came from a dude's dick
*  And if you really wanted to get him you gotta get him right from the tap because you can't have him in the air
*  They die instantly. Yeah, so you gotta literally take it from the cock to your mouth. Sorry. There's no other way. Oh
*  Jamie's like I'd rather have brain damage. Can I picture a movie? Sure. Okay, so do with cocks
*  Yes, it does. It's a lot of that
*  So these chinese guys are actually bred in a lab to make they're not out in the streets
*  But then they get the but that's just to milk them for their fucking juice juice, you know, right?
*  But super sperm and they get out they get out they lock one didn't lock the door
*  Oh, they get out then it's these monster guys and people want to kill them. But also don't kill them
*  We need their sperm. Right? So it's first they try to capture them alive
*  They're also massive dudes and then people want to suck their dick
*  So when they're about to be caught maybe that has something to do with it, right?
*  The cops in the backseat sucking his dick when they're arrested. That's how they'll get out a bunch
*  I got a bad back. Do you mind before we go in there? You mind? I get it. Come on back here
*  Real quick come on back here and he like lets me off in a snap
*  That would be the greatest fucking gay porno of all time. Yeah, it would you have to really shoot it
*  Well, superman engineered superman with a giant hard dick and everybody wants to suck his dick because it cures all of your ailments
*  Yeah, and he wants out to live his free life. I've had a bad acl since 86. It's too important. You can't live free
*  I'll suck it. I'll and they that's all you have to do
*  Yeah
*  I mean, it's great. They've done research
*  They know but imagine if that was the only way you could get your stem cells. It was like jesus touching you. Yeah
*  Yeah, I mean it's the
*  Labs he would constantly escape like yeah, how much do you make a year officer 50 grand?
*  All right, what do you hurt? You got stabbed and you want I can I can
*  Let's just make a deal. Just open your mouth. I'll jerk off in it. You don't have to suck it. Your wife's got the cancer
*  Your wife's got cancer you can shotgun it from like you don't have to suck it
*  Shotgun it you're gonna take it and then put it on I guess I'll tell you when
*  Just pretend you're sucking on your own. Ready? Go
*  Now spit it in her mouth spit in her mouth swallow it feel the healing
*  Yeah, it can't hit air at all. That's the catch. Can't hit air. You gotta make it air tight
*  Someone has to plug your butt during this too at least with the toe
*  Uh
*  How long before women have robot fuck dolls once men have robot fuck dolls how many years before women have them after that?
*  Well, I think it'll be when men allow
*  No, they'll allow I don't think it's a good idea
*  Right off the bat have it. They already have it. They just don't have the body that goes with it
*  They already have the best fuck things they have
*  Vibrators and giant dongs and purple dishes you want hardness men want softness which is harder replicate than hardness
*  What are you a chemist? Maybe some man would want something interesting that a woman would probably take advantage of like what what do you mean?
*  Not all men want to
*  uh
*  What how high are you?
*  Some girls gonna take eventually
*  Yeah, but they can some girls gonna take like oh you're saying that's how they get that machine or I get what you're saying
*  Like oh this it was made for a guy. It'll be a
*  Gaze will be like i'm a man. I want mine and the women are like, can I use yours while you're not using it?
*  Right, right. So a gay guy has a fuck doll then he I get it like a massager is not for a massage
*  It's for whatever girls use it for when the lesbian forecloses on the gay man's house for partying all day and not working
*  Right, right, right. Um, then she can use their fuck doll. Yeah industrious lesbian. She goes. Yeah
*  Luther you're a loser, but you got a good fuck doll
*  Yeah, clean it up and bring it by my place. Yeah, is this all part of the movie?
*  Yeah, yeah, this is how it ends
*  with the lesbian entrepreneur
*  Getting the fuck doll and payment for back rent
*  Okay
*  This I mean we're about 50 years away from having indistinguishable. I just made that number up, but i'm pretty confident
*  No, it's indistinguishable human robots. That's exactly right. I think it's about right, right? Yeah, right about when you and I are ready to kick the bucket
