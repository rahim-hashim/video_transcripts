# Joe Rogan Experience #1879 - Sober October 4
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6.0s)]
*  You got some stogies, Bert? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10.0s)]
*  I bought cigars. There's nothing better that we're talking about this than a cigar and a coffee in the morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=14.0s)]
*  In the morning, yeah. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=18.0s)]
*  You know what's better? A joint. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=19.0s)]
*  We should address that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=21.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a real issue. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=22.0s)]
*  Not with me, Tom. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=25.0s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=26.0s)]
*  Dude, I don't have the cravings that Joe has. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=27.0s)]
*  You gotta see Stanhope in the green room these days. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=29.0s)]
*  Are we recording? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=34.0s)]
*  Wait, are you? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=35.0s)]
*  I can't stand up over here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=36.0s)]
*  Are you not having any drinking cravings? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=38.0s)]
*  Why are you saying Stanhope? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=40.0s)]
*  Because I smoked a cigarette? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=41.0s)]
*  Chugging it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=42.0s)]
*  I smoked one yesterday. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=43.0s)]
*  You breathed it down in one gulp. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=44.0s)]
*  No, no, no. I didn't even smoke the whole thing. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=47.0s)]
*  If Camel Cigarettes could do an ad of you sucking down a cigarette. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=49.0s)]
*  I would sniff paint. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=52.0s)]
*  I would spray paint into a paper bag to get a little bit of a buzz before I go on stage. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=54.0s)]
*  I was just trying to find something. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=62.0s)]
*  Give me something. Give me a buzz. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=65.0s)]
*  I'd fucking hold my breath, stand on my head. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=68.0s)]
*  That feels good. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=71.0s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=75.0s)]
*  I stood up too fast the other day and it felt good. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=78.0s)]
*  It does feel good. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=81.0s)]
*  I stood up too fast and it felt good. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=82.0s)]
*  You know what I really feel with the weed? Writing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=84.0s)]
*  When I sit down to write. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=87.0s)]
*  When I don't have weed and I just sit down to write, it's like I'm writing with weights on. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=88.0s)]
*  It's like running. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=92.0s)]
*  Running with a weight vest on. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=94.0s)]
*  With weed I just can get into it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=96.0s)]
*  I just get into my head and I just find ideas. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=99.0s)]
*  Just run. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=101.0s)]
*  I like being on stage. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=103.0s)]
*  Last night was fun. I was stone sober. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=104.0s)]
*  I love being on stage sober. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=107.0s)]
*  That night was fun though. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=109.0s)]
*  That was a great crowd. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=111.0s)]
*  I'm glad you came down. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=112.0s)]
*  I took one chance to couple with a far right older dude. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=114.0s)]
*  I didn't see his chick. She was against the wall. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=118.0s)]
*  I was making a joke about LeAnn being old. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=120.0s)]
*  I looked over and I saw his chick and she was his age. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=123.0s)]
*  I went, oh shit, your chick's old. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=126.0s)]
*  Then I said age appropriate. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=129.0s)]
*  Then she was like, yeah. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=132.0s)]
*  LeAnn, the biggest thing is when you upgrade. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=135.0s)]
*  When you down age. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=139.0s)]
*  When you down age. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=140.0s)]
*  We had a buddy upgrade. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=141.0s)]
*  He brings his chick and she's fucking. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=143.0s)]
*  Women get angry at that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=145.0s)]
*  Very angry. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=146.0s)]
*  They get angry at anyone else doing it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=147.0s)]
*  Isn't it interesting that guys don't give a fuck? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=148.0s)]
*  If a woman is getting divorced and then she starts fucking her personal trainer and he's 32, no one cares. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=151.0s)]
*  46 year old woman, 30 year old personal trainer, no one cares. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=157.0s)]
*  No one cares at all. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=161.0s)]
*  If she's single and doing it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=162.0s)]
*  Good for her. Look, she's got a hot young guy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=163.0s)]
*  Women are constantly threatened by youth though. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=165.0s)]
*  That's what they're threatened by. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=168.0s)]
*  Men are threatened by a bigger guy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=170.0s)]
*  A stronger, bigger version of them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=174.0s)]
*  That's the threat. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=176.0s)]
*  That's how money thing too. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=177.0s)]
*  Money too. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=178.0s)]
*  Status. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=179.0s)]
*  Money is a big one that angers men. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=180.0s)]
*  When a woman leaves a man for a rich man. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=182.0s)]
*  That one is infuriating. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=184.0s)]
*  That seems like the one that's not a goddamn thing you can do. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=186.0s)]
*  You can't do anything about it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=189.0s)]
*  The same reason the woman can't do anything. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=190.0s)]
*  If you go, my new chick's 24. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=193.0s)]
*  She can't do anything about it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=195.0s)]
*  Women get angry. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=197.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you have a girl leave you for a college senior. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=198.0s)]
*  It's like, alright. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=202.0s)]
*  I'm sorry you left me, but that's fine. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=204.0s)]
*  I would think it's funny. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=207.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=209.0s)]
*  It must be how life goes. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=210.0s)]
*  Here's the thing, that college senior, the funny thing is, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=212.0s)]
*  the college senior would not be a threat to your status. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=215.0s)]
*  He for sure would be a poorer person. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=218.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=221.0s)]
*  But if he's some fucking young stud linebacker [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=224.0s)]
*  and he's just sending it in every night, boom, boom, boom. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=227.0s)]
*  But you'd still be like, did he get his allowance? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=230.0s)]
*  He's in college. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=232.0s)]
*  Here's the deal, women and men accrue interest differently. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=234.0s)]
*  So women are fucking high-end IPOs out the gate. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=240.0s)]
*  And men are penny stocks. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=245.0s)]
*  And then they invest, like a hedge fund, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=247.0s)]
*  they look at these penny stocks like you were a hardcore penny stock. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=251.0s)]
*  But you were. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=254.0s)]
*  I remember you were gaining weight and you were fucking like, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=255.0s)]
*  and your material's questionable. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=258.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=260.0s)]
*  But I've known him so long that when Christina signed up for him, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=263.0s)]
*  that was a risky investment. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=268.0s)]
*  It was. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=271.0s)]
*  There was no promise of success with Tom and podcasting. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=272.0s)]
*  Back then it was just TV and movies. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=275.0s)]
*  She had already been on TV. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=277.0s)]
*  She had already had some success. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=278.0s)]
*  She was transitioning into Santa pretty quick, getting writing jobs. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=280.0s)]
*  She was making the money and Tom was featuring. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=282.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, your stock fucking goes public. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=284.0s)]
*  Netflix special, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=288.0s)]
*  And then, in a weird way, same thing with me, dude. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=291.0s)]
*  I was a rescue dog. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=293.0s)]
*  I feel like this whole analogy was just for me as a Jew. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=295.0s)]
*  But then as that happens, and this is not all shitty, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=300.0s)]
*  but women start aging and then their stock starts declining [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=303.0s)]
*  and then all of a sudden it splits and it splits and splits. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=306.0s)]
*  And then you watch this penny stock keep fucking rising [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=308.0s)]
*  and some dudes go, what the fuck am I doing with this bullshit stock option? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=312.0s)]
*  I'm going to sell out and get brand new fucking stocks. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=316.0s)]
*  Very interesting analogy. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=318.0s)]
*  Did you ever see that guy, the woman who put out, like, I'm looking for a millionaire? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=320.0s)]
*  You remember that guy? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=323.0s)]
*  I'm looking for a millionaire to make me your wife. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=324.0s)]
*  No. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=327.0s)]
*  It sounds familiar. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=328.0s)]
*  You say a guy or a woman? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=329.0s)]
*  A woman said it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=330.0s)]
*  And then some economist was like, let me tell you about the laws of diminishing returns. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=331.0s)]
*  And he broke down why it's a bad investment for any millionaire to take you in. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=335.0s)]
*  You got to look it up. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=340.0s)]
*  It's just like, great. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=341.0s)]

*  Every fucking week. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=359.0s)]
*  But a guy who loves his wife does that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=360.0s)]
*  A guy who doesn't love his wife doesn't say a fucking word and just upgrades one day. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=362.0s)]

*  The women were living. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=396.0s)]
*  And then that night in bed, me and Leanne are there. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=397.0s)]

*  When you hang out with dudes that know cigars, like Bobby Kelly knows cigars. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=507.0s)]
*  Sure, knows cigars. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=509.56s)]
*  He introduced me to Tatoahe, which is one of my favorite cigars. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=510.56s)]
*  And it's almost like you hang out with someone who, it's like hanging out with a grown up [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=514.84s)]
*  all of a sudden, but you're the same age. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=519.52s)]

*  Because he knows his shit. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=525.88s)]
*  He's a man. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=526.88s)]

*  All you gotta know about cigars is $13. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=537.6s)]

*  the owner and being like, hey man, tell me what I want. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=549.28s)]

*  I mean, that's another level. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1070.76s)]
*  I was farting so aggressively the first day not drinking. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1072.76s)]
*  I was at the store and I was trying to have a conversation with someone about disc golf. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1075.76s)]
*  I had my ass in the main room towards the bathroom and I was ripping farts that were [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1079.76s)]
*  just coming. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1084.76s)]
*  Like all this... [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1085.76s)]
*  I think my inflammation is so bad it kind of blocks up my stomach. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1086.76s)]
*  I was gassy as fucking shit. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1090.76s)]
*  But I don't think you account for how much you... [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1092.76s)]
*  When you drink normal Burt drinking, which is a lot, you also eat crazy. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1094.76s)]
*  I eat wild. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1099.76s)]
*  I don't eat bad. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1100.76s)]
*  Last night I grabbed those tacos and the bell pepper, brought it home and I went, I don't [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1101.76s)]
*  want this. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1105.76s)]
*  Bullshit. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1106.76s)]
*  I gave it to John Manz and my assistant Peter. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1107.76s)]
*  That was an aggressive bullshit, Ari. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1110.76s)]
*  You want to call him right now? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1112.76s)]
*  I don't believe you. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1113.76s)]
*  I don't believe you then. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1114.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1116.76s)]
*  This is aggressive. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1117.76s)]
*  But wait, so don't you think both... [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1118.76s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1119.76s)]
*  There's literally multiple homeless people said, hey, are you eating that food? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1120.76s)]
*  And you go, yeah, I took it to eat it. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1122.76s)]
*  Yeah, I wanted to, but I got home and I went, hold on. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1124.76s)]
*  So you were walking around and homeless people were asking you for your food? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1126.76s)]
*  Yeah, he had a to-go box. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1128.76s)]
*  Welcome to Austin, Joe. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1129.76s)]
*  Where are you walking? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1132.76s)]
*  Where are homeless people asking you for your food? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1133.76s)]
*  From the Vulcan. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1134.76s)]
*  From the Vulcan. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1135.76s)]
*  So you walked all the way to... [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1136.76s)]
*  No, no, I just walked outside the Vulcan and there was a plethora of homeless people going, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1138.76s)]
*  hey, can I get that food from you? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1142.76s)]
*  Is that a doggy bag? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1144.76s)]
*  Can I have it? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1145.76s)]
*  Why didn't you just give him the food then? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1146.76s)]
*  Because I... [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1147.76s)]
*  He took it to eat it. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1148.76s)]
*  Well, at first I took it because I hadn't eaten all day. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1149.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1151.76s)]
*  Then you brought it back and decided not to eat it. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1152.76s)]
*  I got home. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1154.76s)]
*  I got home. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1155.76s)]
*  Here's one of the things that happened a little bit. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1156.76s)]
*  I got this full metabolic blood panel, full comprehensive consular doctor visit. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1159.76s)]
*  The guy said, we were talking about changing my lifestyle. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1166.76s)]
*  There was a period of time, Tom knows this, where I was throwing up while I slept and breathing in my lungs. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1171.76s)]
*  It's called aspirating. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1176.76s)]
*  It was giving me hardcore acid reflux. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1178.76s)]
*  Aspirating. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1182.76s)]
*  I went to the doctor and the doctor said, listen, man, this is going to affect your career. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1183.76s)]
*  You're not going to be able to talk. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1188.76s)]
*  I was losing my voice like crazy. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1189.76s)]
*  He goes, you got to stop eating before you go to bed. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1191.76s)]
*  I stopped entirely. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1193.76s)]
*  I stopped eating before I went to bed. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1195.76s)]
*  Because I saw direct reflection of my career, I could do it. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1197.76s)]
*  Then one of these other doctors, he's like, you need to lose weight. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1202.76s)]
*  He's like, here's why I think you can do that. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1205.76s)]
*  Because you did it with the eating before you went to bed, so you can change your lifestyle. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1207.76s)]
*  It's possible. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1210.76s)]
*  Last night when I went home, I brought the food, because that's my impulse, set it down, called Mans and Peter. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1211.76s)]
*  They came up to my room. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1216.76s)]
*  They ate it. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1217.76s)]
*  I went, I'll be throwing this up in my throat all fucking night. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1218.76s)]
*  All night I won't sleep. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1221.76s)]
*  I won't feel rested. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1222.76s)]
*  I'll go into the podcast feeling like shit. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1223.76s)]
*  I didn't eat any of it. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1225.76s)]
*  I didn't eat any of it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1226.76s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1227.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1228.76s)]
*  It's a great story. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1229.76s)]
*  Do you want to call it bullshit? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1231.76s)]
*  No, he just says the story sucked. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1233.76s)]
*  No, no. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1235.76s)]
*  I meant it's a tall tale. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1236.76s)]
*  So, did not, he couldn't even tell you what was in the tacos. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1238.76s)]
*  Couldn't even tell you. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1242.76s)]
*  Those tacos are good. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1243.76s)]
*  It's a CM smokehouse. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1244.76s)]
*  It's six days, we're six days in. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1246.76s)]
*  Have you already weighed differently? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1248.76s)]
*  I lost like eight pounds. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1250.76s)]
*  How's your tits and your arms? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1252.76s)]
*  Ari could barely hold the mic last night. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1253.76s)]
*  I have to keep switching arms from the push-ups. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1255.76s)]
*  I can't hold a phone to my head for like two minutes. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1257.76s)]
*  I have to switch arms. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1260.76s)]

*  Just to see your max potential? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1316.76s)]
*  No, just to feel like, oh, that's normal. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1318.76s)]

*  I think you almost are aspirated. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1338.76s)]
*  So you go to this concierge service, you get all this blood panel done. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1340.76s)]
*  And what kind of advice is he giving you? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1346.76s)]
*  Well, first of all, he thought I was a liar. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1349.76s)]
*  When we sat down, he was like much like Ari. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1351.76s)]
*  He goes, how much you drink, you're honest. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1353.76s)]
*  I tell him everything. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1355.76s)]
*  And he goes, don't work out. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1356.76s)]
*  And I said, excuse me? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1357.76s)]
*  What? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1358.76s)]
*  He goes, do not work out. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1359.76s)]
*  I don't want you in a gym. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1360.76s)]
*  I don't want you doing anything. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1361.76s)]
*  He goes, you are high risk to literally have a stroke, a heart attack. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1362.76s)]
*  And I went, actually, and by the way, we did a quarter artery scans on my neck, did a [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1366.76s)]
*  Everything. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1372.76s)]
*  Did everything. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1373.76s)]
*  And he's like, and we haven't gotten the results yet. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1374.76s)]
*  I said, I actually go to a cardiologist every six months. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1378.76s)]
*  I work out pretty fucking hard. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1381.76s)]
*  I'm not going to stop working out. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1382.76s)]
*  It's kind of my thing is I wake up, I party, and then I wake up, and then I work out hard [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1384.76s)]
*  as fuck. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1387.76s)]
*  I think I'm fine. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1388.76s)]
*  He goes, trust me, what you're telling me, if you work out, you'll have a stroke and [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1389.76s)]
*  you're going to die. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1393.76s)]
*  Actually, probably because, and he's probably telling you that because most people would. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1394.76s)]
*  But is he telling you this based on the volume of alcohol? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1397.76s)]
*  Based on just a conversation, an interview of like, how much do you drink? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1400.76s)]
*  Yeah, because my weight. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1405.76s)]
*  Most people who would drink like he drinks would not be active. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1406.76s)]
*  And so I told him, I said, hey, man, I'm not going to change anything. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1410.76s)]
*  I'll wait. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1413.76s)]
*  If you want to have that conversation when we get my blood work back and all my tests, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1414.76s)]
*  that's fine. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1417.76s)]
*  But I said, I don't think you're going to find any blockage anywhere because I've already [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1418.76s)]
*  had all these. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1421.76s)]
*  I'm already on medication. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1422.76s)]
*  I'm on blood thinners. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1423.76s)]
*  I think I'm going to be fine. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1424.76s)]
*  I'm going to continue to work out. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1425.76s)]
*  I'll scale it back a titch. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1427.76s)]
*  A titch. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1429.76s)]
*  But like, I mean, just usually I go until like I work out pretty fucking hard. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1430.76s)]
*  And so yeah, I worked out with you on a gym. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1434.76s)]
*  You get after it. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1436.76s)]
*  And so blood work comes back like two days later, three days later. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1437.76s)]
*  And he's like, I don't know what to tell you. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1441.76s)]
*  He's like, none of it makes sense. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1443.76s)]
*  He's like, you have no blockage. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1445.76s)]
*  From what you're telling me, either you're lying to me or he's got a test for the man. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1447.76s)]
*  Well, I think you're a very unusual specimen. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1451.76s)]

*  I don't remember it. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1597.48s)]
*  It's in the south wing. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1598.48s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1599.48s)]
*  South wing. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1600.48s)]
*  Yeah, I have a hot yoga room. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1601.48s)]
*  So you can turn it up to whatever you can get in. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1603.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's bigger than this room and it has its own heating system. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1604.48s)]
*  And so it's completely isolated from the rest of the gym. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1608.1999999999998s)]
*  So you can crank it up to 105, whatever the fuck you want. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1610.1999999999998s)]
*  You want to get crazy, you can go 130. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1612.3999999999999s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1614.3999999999999s)]
*  That's angst. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1615.3999999999999s)]
*  I know a lot of guys who do, there's a company that makes an infrared sauna that's designed [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1616.3999999999999s)]
*  specifically for working out in. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1620.76s)]
*  It has chin-up bars and shit. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1622.48s)]
*  See if you can find what that is. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1624.08s)]
*  It's a different kind of sauna than I use. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1626.24s)]
*  I use the traditional rock sauna, like the hot rocks. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1627.8s)]
*  How hot do you go? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1631.28s)]
*  I do 185. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1632.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1633.28s)]
*  Infrared is a little more sustainable, meaning I had an infrared one for a while, I have [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1634.48s)]
*  the hot rock one. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1639.32s)]
*  I love the hot rock one. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1640.32s)]
*  But infrared you can go in and actually sit in there for 35 minutes and you build. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1641.68s)]
*  Yeah, but see that's the problem. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1645.28s)]
*  The problem is like the reason why it's uncomfortable when you're going really hot is like that's [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1646.8s)]
*  what you need because that's how your body builds the heat shock proteins. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1652.08s)]
*  There's not the same kind of studies that are done on infrared saunas. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1654.98s)]
*  Like the 20-year Finland study, there's a Finland study that showed a 40% decrease in [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1658.68s)]
*  all cause mortality for people who use the sauna four times a week, 20 minutes at a [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1663.96s)]
*  time and I think it's 170, 175 degrees. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1668.96s)]
*  But they showed a 40% decrease in strokes, heart attacks, like everything, cancer. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1672.1200000000001s)]
*  Well it's non-impact cardiovascular, correct? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1676.8400000000001s)]
*  It is. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1679.32s)]
*  I'm pairing you, I think. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1680.32s)]
*  Yes, you're sitting there and your heart is jet. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1681.32s)]
*  I wore the heart strap the other day. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1683.32s)]
*  I wore two. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1684.32s)]
*  An hour at the Schmitz. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1685.32s)]
*  It's like 134, 135, so your head is like a slow, steady heart because I'm hot as balls [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1686.32s)]
*  in there. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1692.92s)]
*  Yeah, so what's it called? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1694.88s)]
*  What's the company called? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1696.88s)]
*  Lux Sauna. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1698.88s)]
*  Wait, is that speed bags in a sauna? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1699.88s)]
*  Yeah, speed bags in a sauna, they have chin-up bars. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1702.88s)]
*  There's certain saunas that I know, I know a bunch of MMA fighters are using them, but [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1705.96s)]
*  the thing is this is definitely better than no sauna, but the thing about the hot sauna, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1710.04s)]
*  this is what Laird Hamilton told me. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1715.6000000000001s)]
*  Laird Hamilton does it with oven mitts. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1717.76s)]
*  Well, he gets on an air-dine bike, but he does it in a regular dry sauna. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1720.6399999999999s)]
*  So what's wrong with the infrared? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1724.6399999999999s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1726.6399999999999s)]
*  No, it's great for you. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1727.6399999999999s)]
*  Infrared's meant to increase your core body temperature before your skin. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1728.6399999999999s)]
*  The studies on sauna and longevity and health that came out of Finland were these really [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1730.6399999999999s)]
*  amazing studies that I was just citing, and that's with a regular sauna. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1737.6s)]
*  And the thing about the regular sauna is it's more uncomfortable, but the more uncomfortable [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1741.56s)]
*  one is the one that jacks your heart rate up and it also makes your body work harder, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1745.16s)]
*  and that's what produces the heat shock proteins. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1749.24s)]
*  At least that's what I've been told, and this is talking to Dr. Rhonda Patrick and Laird [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1751.24s)]
*  Hamilton and Andrew Huberman and all these scientists when they're talking about the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1755.44s)]
*  specific things that happen in your body. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1760.52s)]
*  Your body produces cytokines. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1763.0s)]
*  It produces these anti-inflammatory heat shock proteins that are just fucking phenomenal [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1764.4s)]
*  for everything. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1769.4s)]
*  Dude, I crave it so bad. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1770.4s)]
*  When I'm on the road and I come home, sometimes I'll get home at night and everyone's asleep, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1772.16s)]
*  I'll just fire up the fucking sauna. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1775.8400000000001s)]
*  It's so great. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1777.28s)]
*  That's the dream. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1778.3999999999999s)]
*  Have you ever seen it? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1779.3999999999999s)]
*  My dad has one in his basement and it's just like, they all go to sleep. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1780.3999999999999s)]
*  It's the best thing to have right there. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1783.16s)]
*  You sleep so well. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1784.36s)]
*  It makes you feel so relaxed when you're done. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1785.36s)]
*  And with the combination of that and the cold plunge, so when I get home, I get in the sauna, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1787.48s)]
*  I got a Salus sauna and then I got that Morosco forge at home, and we have the Blue Cube here, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1791.8s)]
*  which is pretty dope too. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1797.36s)]
*  The Blue Cube cold plunge, the water circulates, so it's like you're in a fucking river. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1798.52s)]
*  It's like, eeeh! [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1802.92s)]
*  You never get a thermal layer around your skin, so you're never comfortable. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1803.92s)]
*  When you get out of that fucking thing after three minutes, you're like, ahhh. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1807.92s)]
*  Yeah, the relaxation. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1811.0800000000002s)]
*  The weight of the world is gone. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1812.0800000000002s)]
*  Did you ever see the video I did where I had my whoop on and I did my heart rate in the [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1813.72s)]
*  sauna and then I went right into the polar plunge and it went from 145 to 65 in like [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1818.6000000000001s)]
*  three minutes? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1824.3600000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1825.3600000000001s)]
*  See if you can find it. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1826.3600000000001s)]
*  It's sped up so you can see it, but my whoop, my fucking, I can't tell if I slept good [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1827.3600000000001s)]
*  unless I look at my fucking recovery. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1835.72s)]
*  What is that strap? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1837.28s)]
*  I got the new fancy strap. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1838.28s)]
*  What is it, like a tie-dye? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1839.8s)]
*  No, it's kind of a chemo. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1841.8s)]
*  Chemo? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1843.8s)]
*  Have you noticed? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1844.8s)]
*  Do you have different recoveries since you stopped drinking? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1845.8s)]
*  Oh, well my recovery on tequila is better than my recovery without alcohol. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1849.2s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1852.76s)]
*  Look at this, look at this. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1853.76s)]
*  So 141, right? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1854.76s)]
*  140, and then I just get in the sauna and you'll see it. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1855.76s)]
*  Who did this video for you? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1860.4s)]
*  How do they do that? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1861.4s)]
*  You can do it going on whoop, they have a video thing. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1862.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh nice. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1865.0s)]
*  Where you can record yourself. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1866.0s)]
*  I do it every time I go in the sauna, I record my heart rate dropping. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1867.8s)]
*  And so you go right in and look at the... [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1870.64s)]
*  I gotta keep my hand out so my whoop monitors it. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1872.32s)]
*  Is this next to your old place? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1874.88s)]
*  That's my new house. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1876.16s)]
*  If you put your hand under, the whoop won't monitor it? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1877.4s)]
*  No. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1880.64s)]
*  Wow, that's quick. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1881.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, you gotta take a shower. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1882.64s)]
*  It's dropping your heart down. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1883.64s)]
*  In two minutes, I'm already in the 70s. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1884.64s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1887.88s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1888.88s)]
*  It's just 66 in three minutes. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1889.88s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1891.84s)]
*  And then back up a little. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1892.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1893.84s)]
*  What temperature do you keep your cold plunger? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1894.84s)]
*  Dick looks so small in that. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=1896.08s)]

*  He's going to have to be there a few times. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2291.04s)]
*  So we're going to have to plan it with your ovulation to make sure that you're not getting [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2292.04s)]
*  this pregnant, his baby. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2295.8s)]

*  That's incredible. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2299.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but that's one of the cool things is like, you know, they find things out sometimes [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2300.7599999999998s)]
*  accidentally. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2304.24s)]
*  You always wonder too what the most powerful people have access to. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2305.24s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2312.16s)]
*  But then like something will happen like Paul Allen, you know, the Microsoft co-founder. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2313.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2315.88s)]

*  Well, he was like really unhealthy and didn't exercise at all. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2317.88s)]
*  But he just got, I think, non-Hoskins lymphoma or some cancer and then he just declined and [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2321.8s)]
*  died. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2327.4s)]

*  Like try to chase down what's wrong. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2332.4s)]
*  Because the other people in your life are like, this motherfucker dies. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2335.04s)]
*  I get paid. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2337.7200000000003s)]

*  What did Andrew Huberman do? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2438.1200000000003s)]
*  We were on the phone with him during a podcast and he had just posted that week about, you [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2439.1200000000003s)]
*  know, you'll have like topics and themes for his podcast, right? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2445.82s)]
*  And it was just all about alcohol. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2449.9s)]
*  And he was basically like, there is just clear data that is undeniable that alcohol has negative [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2451.82s)]
*  effects on you. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2460.26s)]
*  And it is undeniable. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2461.86s)]
*  And here's all the data, you know, breaking down how it affects the brain and the organs [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2463.74s)]
*  of the system. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2468.02s)]
*  And then he's like, well, I mean, like, what can, you know, can I drink? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2469.02s)]
*  And Andrew's like, well, yes. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2472.9399999999996s)]
*  Studies show that if you want to have one to two drinks, and he goes, a week. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2475.2599999999998s)]
*  A week? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2481.2599999999998s)]
*  A week? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2482.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, that's what Andrew's saying. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2483.2599999999998s)]
*  That would be fine. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2486.18s)]
*  And he's like, oh, a little bit more. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2487.18s)]
*  There was actually a study recently. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2488.18s)]
*  I know you're cutting out, Andrew. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2489.18s)]
*  I can't hear you. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2490.18s)]
*  There was a study recently that linked decline in cognitive function to abstinence from alcohol. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2491.62s)]
*  To decline? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2497.7s)]
*  To abstinence from alcohol. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2498.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2499.7s)]
*  Dementia, decline from alcohol is correlated with abstinence from alcohol. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2500.7s)]
*  See if you can find that, Jamie. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2504.06s)]
*  Correlators. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2505.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no, they think that people who don't drink alcohol, I don't know if correlation [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2506.8599999999997s)]
*  doesn't equal causation, right? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2512.5s)]
*  But there's some sort of a connection. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2514.3799999999997s)]
*  I think it's a relaxation thing. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2516.06s)]
*  I was talking about this with my dad last time, my stepdad. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2517.86s)]
*  He's actually my dad. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2521.78s)]
*  Why don't you call him my dad? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2522.78s)]
*  We were talking about... [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2523.78s)]
*  I mean, are you raising him? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2524.78s)]
*  There's a lot of pasts going into that statement. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2525.78s)]
*  No, he's a great guy. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2527.78s)]
*  I love him. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2529.1800000000003s)]
*  But we were talking about it. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2530.1800000000003s)]
*  He has always been a guy, after work, works hard, has a drink. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2533.1s)]
*  Maybe two. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2537.78s)]
*  Just relaxes. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2538.78s)]
*  And I was like, I think there's something to be said for that. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2539.9s)]
*  I think there's something to be said for just the way it makes you feel. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2542.46s)]
*  Most risk for all-cause dementia in people who abstain from alcohol. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2546.1s)]
*  A recent Addiction Journal paper, researchers performed an in-depth analysis of the alcohol-dementia [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2549.2999999999997s)]
*  relationship and determined whether certain levels of alcohol consumption increases the [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2554.18s)]
*  risk of dementia. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2558.7s)]
*  And so they found out that there's an increase in dementia. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2560.2599999999998s)]
*  Dementia generally affects the elderly and geriatric patients, blah, blah, blah, blah, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2564.94s)]
*  blah. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2569.14s)]
*  Global presence of dementia, what does it say here? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2570.14s)]
*  High levels of alcohol consumption in midlife, BERT, can cause significant neurotoxic effects [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2572.62s)]
*  on the brain as compared to other risk factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2577.7s)]
*  Despite these different reports, views of population-based observational studies indicate [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2584.54s)]
*  that alcohol-dementia relationship is J-shaped. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2588.8199999999997s)]
*  More specifically, low levels of alcohol may provide some... [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2591.3399999999997s)]
*  What are you pointing the R for? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2595.3399999999997s)]
*  J-shaped. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2598.3399999999997s)]
*  Low levels of alcohol may provide some benefit in reducing the risk of dementia, whereas [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2599.46s)]
*  excessive alcohol consumption, BERT, likely increases the risk of dementia in a dose-dependent [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2604.2200000000003s)]
*  manner. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2609.98s)]
*  So I think there's something about, like, you get home, you're fucking hard day at the [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2610.98s)]
*  office, have a cocktail, you're like, oh. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2614.42s)]
*  That's how I do it. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2617.02s)]

*  With my family, looking at the ocean. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2637.02s)]
*  Ah. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2640.54s)]
*  Yeah, it was rad. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2641.54s)]
*  What the fuck is it about the ocean? [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2642.54s)]

*  We spent the summer at the ocean, and here we live on a lake, there's no comparison. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2646.54s)]
*  Lakes are rad. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2651.54s)]

*  It is a totally different thing. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2654.54s)]
*  I got a house once for three months when I was in Malibu. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2656.3399999999997s)]
*  We were getting our kitchen remodeled, and I said, let's just rent a house. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2659.3399999999997s)]
*  We rented a house on the water. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2662.94s)]
*  It's fucking amazing. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2664.3399999999997s)]
*  We're eating breakfast, and the water's right there. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2665.3399999999997s)]
*  You just stare out at it. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2668.3399999999997s)]
*  Those rich people aren't stupid. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2669.3399999999997s)]
*  There's a reason why they're paying fucking $100 million for a house that's like a quarter [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2670.3399999999997s)]
*  of an acre. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2675.94s)]
*  The ultimate was, we'd always talked about surfing, and I've always wanted to surf. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2676.94s)]
*  So I set a goal for myself. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2680.94s)]
*  I had two months off, no touring. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2682.3399999999997s)]
*  I said, I'm going to go to Hawaii at the end of two months. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2683.94s)]
*  I'm going to lose weight, get into the 240s, and I'm going to get, because my hardest part [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2685.94s)]
*  is standing up on a board when you're fat. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2689.64s)]
*  So I lost the weight, flew my daughter right before she went to college, my sister, my [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2691.94s)]
*  cameraman, and my assistant down. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2696.34s)]
*  We all went to Hawaii, stayed at Turtle Bay, did Jamie O'Brien's surf experience, and I [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2697.54s)]
*  surfed. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2701.94s)]
*  I surfed fucking solid two days, caught probably 25 waves. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2702.94s)]
*  There is a genuine, surreal connection with the earth when you're on a board sliding down [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2707.2400000000002s)]
*  a wave, and you're moving over on the wave, and you're just watching it. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2713.54s)]
*  It's the coolest fucking thing that I've ever done. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2717.74s)]
*  And then you look at these guys like Nathan Florence and Kyle Enney and Koer Rothman, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2720.14s)]
*  who dude, they're like fucking savages, and they're going into jaws, towed in, and you're [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2726.34s)]
*  just like, oh, that's wild. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2731.34s)]
*  That's a different thing though. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2733.14s)]
*  That's a different thing. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2734.14s)]
*  Those guys are adrenaline junkies to the extreme. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2735.14s)]
*  But the connection those guys have with the ocean is so primal. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2737.9399999999996s)]
*  And I mean, you're right. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2743.3399999999997s)]
*  Dude, do you know what would happen every day? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2744.9399999999996s)]
*  Because we did the same thing. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2746.9399999999996s)]
*  We rented a house in Malibu. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2747.9399999999996s)]
*  Because the tide changes every day, right? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2750.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2752.74s)]
*  And when at low tide, sometimes low tide would be, let's say, at 8 a.m. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2753.74s)]
*  So you'd look out, and the water would be so far out that there would be rocks that [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2756.3399999999997s)]
*  you normally don't see, right? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2762.14s)]
*  And you're like, oh, wow. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2764.14s)]
*  You can walk into the ocean because the tide's so low. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2765.54s)]
*  Dude, high tide made me respect and fear the ocean so much. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2769.54s)]
*  Why would it mean? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2776.14s)]
*  Because it would come up and hit the house with such violence on some days that you would [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2777.14s)]
*  go, if I, an adult who can swim, were down here right now, most likely you would drown. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2782.54s)]
*  Smashed. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2788.14s)]
*  And you would get pulled out and die. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2789.14s)]
*  Yeah, that happens all the time. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2790.54s)]
*  I know. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2791.94s)]
*  When you're living there, you're like, holy shit. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2793.7400000000002s)]

*  You look down. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2797.14s)]
*  Well, you know the difference for me was at night. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2798.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2799.7400000000002s)]
*  During the day, the ocean is like this beautiful, inviting, wonderful thing. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2800.7400000000002s)]
*  At night, it's dark. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2804.34s)]
*  So dark. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2805.34s)]
*  And you just realize, oh my god, that's like a fucking hundred trillion gallons of water. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2806.34s)]
*  Like, what the fuck is that? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2809.94s)]
*  The guy who discovered Hawaii, not discovered, obviously, there are people there first. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2811.34s)]
*  John Cook. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2814.54s)]
*  John Cook, is that his name? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2815.54s)]
*  Captain Cook? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2817.14s)]
*  They ate him. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2818.14s)]
*  They ate him? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2819.14s)]
*  They ate him. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2820.14s)]
*  They didn't eat him. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2821.14s)]
*  No, they didn't eat him. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2822.14s)]
*  I just, when I was in Hawaii, I watched. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2823.14s)]
*  I liked that story. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2825.14s)]
*  I listened to documentaries. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2826.14s)]
*  They ate him. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2827.14s)]
*  I liked Ari's story better. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2828.14s)]
*  They killed him and ate him. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2829.14s)]
*  Let's go with Ari's story. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2830.14s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2831.14s)]
*  He couldn't swim. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2832.14s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2833.14s)]
*  What? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2834.14s)]
*  He got in a boat and he couldn't swim? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2835.14s)]
*  He couldn't. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2836.14s)]
*  That's how they got him. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2837.14s)]
*  How long does it take to learn to swim? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2838.14s)]
*  That's how they got him. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2839.14s)]
*  I think I could learn to swim in about 10 minutes. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2840.14s)]
*  It's not like doing jiu jitsu. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2843.7799999999997s)]
*  It's you fucking do this. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2847.74s)]
*  But I think it's so built up in your head. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2849.14s)]
*  By the time you get in there, it's panic. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2852.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but you could. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2853.8199999999997s)]
*  You live on a boat. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2854.8199999999997s)]
*  How do you not? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2856.2599999999998s)]
*  How do you not learn how to swim? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2857.2599999999998s)]
*  He never learned how to swim. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2858.2599999999998s)]
*  That's how they got him. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2859.2599999999998s)]
*  He went in and he tried to escape, get to the water, and he had to stop at the water [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2860.2599999999998s)]
*  because he's like, I don't know what to do in there. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2863.58s)]
*  He fucking traveled the world, discovered the sandwich islands and all of Hawaii. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2864.9799999999996s)]
*  They call them the sandwich islands? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2869.74s)]
*  It's because of the sandwich. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2871.14s)]
*  In Italy, they call them the sandwich islands. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2872.14s)]
*  Oh. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2875.18s)]
*  What a fucking weird thing to not know how to do. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2876.18s)]
*  I could understand if you don't grow up near a pool and you never learn. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2881.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2883.86s)]
*  You're like, oh, I never learned how to swim. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2884.86s)]
*  With your boat captain? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2885.86s)]
*  It's like crazy. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2886.86s)]
*  There's a lot of comics that don't know how to swim. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2887.86s)]
*  Who? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2890.06s)]
*  I'm not going to say his name. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2891.06s)]
*  Who? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2892.06s)]
*  Say his name. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2893.06s)]

*  Call them out. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2895.06s)]

*  I was going to say. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2900.06s)]
*  Oh, I could teach him. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2901.06s)]
*  I could teach him. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2902.06s)]
*  Isn't he embarrassed? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2903.06s)]
*  He teases. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2904.06s)]
*  Yeah, aren't you embarrassed? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2905.06s)]
*  I'm sorry, Sebastian. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2906.06s)]
*  He's a swiz. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2907.06s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2908.06s)]
*  One of my favorite bits, I watched him talk about it on stage. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2910.02s)]
*  About how he can't swim? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2912.02s)]
*  Crying, laughing. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2913.62s)]
*  He talked about it on stage how he can't swim and you won't say it. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2914.62s)]
*  And you're afraid of him. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2916.62s)]
*  It's his bit. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2917.62s)]
*  I don't want to fuck with his bit. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2918.62s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2919.62s)]
*  But that's not fucking with his bit. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2920.62s)]
*  But he, I went backstage and I was like, that's fucking hilarious. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2921.62s)]
*  And he's like, eh? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2923.62s)]
*  And I go, you really can't swim? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2926.62s)]
*  And he goes, no. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2928.62s)]
*  He goes, no, not everyone can swim. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2929.62s)]
*  He's got a pool. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2931.62s)]
*  I go, everyone can swim, Sebastian. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2932.62s)]
*  What? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2933.62s)]
*  He's got a pool. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2934.62s)]
*  What, does he put the floaties in his arm? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2935.62s)]
*  No, he was taking swimming lessons. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2936.62s)]
*  And it was hilarious to hear a grown man. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2938.18s)]
*  So if he took swimming lessons, now he knows how to swim. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2940.18s)]
*  No. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2942.18s)]
*  Fuck out of here. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2943.18s)]
*  He failed his lessons? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2944.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2945.18s)]
*  That he keep fishing them out? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2946.18s)]
*  He did it on stage and I was crying, laughing. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2947.18s)]
*  Kind of humiliating to be an adult. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2950.18s)]
*  He has a kid. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2953.18s)]
*  You know what's really amazing? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2954.18s)]
*  When you kick and swim better than you? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2955.18s)]
*  I had a dog, my Mastiff, he never learned how to swim. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2956.18s)]
*  He just was not interested in swimming. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2959.18s)]
*  I'd pick him up, I'd take him in the water and he'd just swim right back to the stairs. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2961.18s)]
*  I'm like, come on, Johnny, let's go. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2964.18s)]
*  Let's try it, yeah. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2965.18s)]
*  But Marshall, the golden retriever, it's like in his DNA. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2966.74s)]
*  When he was a puppy, we were in the pool and he's like, fuck yeah! [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2969.74s)]
*  Woo! [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2974.74s)]
*  Some kids take to it quick. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2975.74s)]
*  My oldest took to it real quick. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2976.74s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2978.74s)]
*  Yeah, he swims like a fucking lunatic now. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2979.74s)]
*  I think if they just do it early, it's fun. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2980.74s)]
*  You gotta do it early. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2982.74s)]
*  You gotta get your dog in the pool right away. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2983.74s)]
*  Does Marshall dive down? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2984.74s)]
*  Oh yeah, he does. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2985.74s)]
*  Dives underwater? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2986.74s)]
*  He would. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2987.74s)]
*  I mean, if the ball's underwater, he'll go underwater. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2988.74s)]
*  That's a water dog though. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2991.74s)]
*  He's a golden retriever. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2993.74s)]
*  Mastiffs are not. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2995.2999999999997s)]
*  Our old mastiff, Priscilla, the funniest fucking look on her face one time, she fell into the [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=2996.2999999999997s)]
*  pool. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3003.2599999999998s)]
*  We didn't know she fell into the pool. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3004.2599999999998s)]
*  She fell into the pool, she got herself out of the pool, and I saw this look in her face. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3005.7s)]
*  She was by the pool and you could see it in her eyes. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3009.8199999999997s)]
*  I just witnessed death, but I didn't figure it out. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3012.3799999999997s)]
*  I was like, wait, why are you soaking wet? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3014.3799999999997s)]
*  Why are you soaking wet? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3017.3799999999997s)]
*  She's looking at me like, I almost just died! [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3018.3799999999997s)]
*  No one was gonna fucking save me! [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3019.3799999999997s)]
*  Oh my god, poor dog. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3021.3799999999997s)]
*  Dude, I get bandit when we just have the look of like, I'm gonna put her in the pool. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3023.22s)]
*  Like, she'll be fine by the pool and you look at her, she knows the look, she's like, get [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3026.62s)]
*  the fuck away from me! [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3029.78s)]
*  Then she just starts running away. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3030.78s)]
*  She knows what we're gonna do. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3031.78s)]
*  So, was she a rescue? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3032.78s)]
*  Yep, but like as a baby. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3033.78s)]
*  And you just never got her into a pool? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3034.78s)]
*  We tried and then she just wasn't interested. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3037.78s)]
*  But we should've tried harder. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3039.78s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta make it fun. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3040.78s)]
*  You gotta make it fun. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3041.78s)]
*  But Marshall, I didn't have to do anything. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3042.78s)]
*  It's in his DNA. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3043.78s)]
*  It's in his DNA, which is really wild. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3044.78s)]
*  Like another thing is- [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3047.78s)]
*  He's got webbed feet, Joe. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3048.78s)]
*  Yeah, no he does. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3049.78s)]
*  Another thing that's really wild is the retriever aspect. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3051.5800000000004s)]
*  I didn't teach that dog at all to bring a ball back. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3053.2200000000003s)]
*  He just brings it back. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3055.86s)]
*  Like the first time I ever threw a ball to him, he picks it up and he brings it back. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3056.86s)]
*  Wow, knew how to fetch. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3060.38s)]
*  Instantly. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3062.38s)]
*  He doesn't know how to let it go, but he brings it back. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3063.38s)]
*  Like the other day, I came home, I let him outside, and then I left the door open and [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3065.38s)]
*  went to the bathroom. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3071.1400000000003s)]
*  It took a leak. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3072.1400000000003s)]
*  I came out of the bathroom and he's got a squirrel in his mouth. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3073.1400000000003s)]
*  No! [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3075.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, he killed a squirrel. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3076.5800000000004s)]
*  And he's just sitting there. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3077.5800000000004s)]
*  He caught a squirrel? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3078.5800000000004s)]
*  Instantly. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3079.5800000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3081.38s)]
*  But he came to me to retrieve and bring a squirrel. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3082.38s)]
*  Whatever they did to breed those dogs, it's encoded in their memory. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3086.2999999999997s)]
*  It's encoded in their DNA. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3090.34s)]
*  It's really wild. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3091.86s)]
*  It's also those dogs, like Goldens, they are the nicest dogs. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3093.86s)]
*  I like your dog a lot. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3098.98s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3100.58s)]
*  He's such a sweetie to everybody. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3101.58s)]
*  Everybody who comes over to my house, like, you're my best friend! [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3105.22s)]
*  The few people that he just meets, he starts whining, he picks up a toy, he always has [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3109.1s)]
*  to bring a toy to you. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3112.66s)]
*  He brings something, because those dogs were rewarded for bringing back like birds. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3114.38s)]
*  Like, you'd shoot a bird, they'd grab the bird, bring it back to you, they'd retrieve [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3118.7799999999997s)]
*  it. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3121.66s)]
*  And he just will bring something to you immediately. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3122.66s)]
*  It's funny when you see what they're... [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3124.58s)]
*  They're very gentle mouths too. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3125.58s)]
*  Oh, they're so gentle. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3126.58s)]
*  What they're bred for, because we had Brussels Graffons and they're bred for being rat chasers. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3127.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3131.46s)]
*  So when they see rodents, squirrels and stuff, they'll be like, and then they're like, you'll [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3132.46s)]
*  see them freak the fuck out. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3138.5s)]
*  Have you ever seen that documentary Rats on Netflix? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3139.5s)]
*  No. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3142.34s)]
*  It's about New York. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3143.34s)]
*  Jack Russell Terriers. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3144.34s)]
*  Well, it's about a lot of cities. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3145.34s)]
*  It's also about the countryside. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3146.94s)]
*  Jack Russell Terriers were actually designed or bred for killing rats. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3148.42s)]
*  They're really aggressive with rats and they fucking tear them apart. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3153.26s)]
*  And in this documentary, they use them to get rats. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3157.34s)]
*  And so they let these dogs loose and they find rats in this countryside, tear them apart. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3160.98s)]
*  Yeah, there's a service. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3164.34s)]
*  There's a service you can get to go in your... [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3165.38s)]
*  If you have a backyard in New York where you just have these terriers just piss all over [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3167.1000000000004s)]
*  your yard. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3170.98s)]

*  Get out of there. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3175.02s)]
*  They're smart as shit, man. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3176.02s)]

*  There's those little dogs. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3179.02s)]
*  So these guys are digging holes to try to find these rats because there's these rat [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3180.02s)]
*  little dens and shit and these dogs find them. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3184.78s)]
*  And they're the cutest little dogs, man, but not to rats. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3188.32s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3190.82s)]
*  Murder it. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3191.82s)]
*  Murder it. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3192.82s)]
*  Oh, they do? [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3193.82s)]
*  They're just being cut into pieces. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3195.3s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3196.3s)]
*  All of them. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3197.3s)]
*  I mean, it's just fucking wild. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3198.3s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3199.3s)]
*  That little one's like, give me some. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3200.3s)]
*  But meanwhile, these rats have fucking diseases. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3201.3s)]
*  So your dog is swallowing the plague. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3203.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3205.38s)]
*  Not out of the countryside, though. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3206.38s)]
*  Not out there. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3207.38s)]

*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3209.38s)]
*  So what do they get in the plague? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3210.38s)]

*  It must be sewage. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3222.5800000000004s)]
*  They'll run around all the sewage. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3224.34s)]
*  You know about... [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3226.74s)]

*  Yeah, rat king. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3229.74s)]
*  When the tails get tied up. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3230.74s)]
*  Yeah, they get knotted up together somehow and they die. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3232.74s)]
*  And they can't move. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3235.38s)]

*  Look at this guy. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3537.78s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3538.78s)]
*  You should have seen him in the green room last night doing girl sit-ups or girl chin-ups [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3539.78s)]

*  Ari doesn't work out at all. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3554.38s)]

*  now artificially. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3665.14s)]

*  I go, why is it a real problem? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3669.14s)]
*  And he was coming at it from a diamond seller's perspective. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3670.14s)]
*  Sure. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3674.14s)]
*  He's like, well, I goes, is it a real diamond? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3675.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's not legit. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3677.14s)]
*  It's not legit because it doesn't come from the ground. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3679.54s)]
*  I go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3682.14s)]

*  Yeah, but people get upset if they find out that it's artificial. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3686.14s)]
*  But it's an actual diamond. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3688.74s)]
*  Like if you make an actual diamond with a machine, like why do you give a fuck if it [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3691.74s)]
*  came from the ground? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3695.18s)]

*  It's not like a QAnon or a Zirconia. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3703.74s)]
*  I want someone with one hand missing delivering it to me. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3704.74s)]
*  I want a testimonial from the fucking orphan children. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3708.74s)]
*  But women do not want that fucking man-made diamond. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3710.74s)]
*  They want that one that is hard to get. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3715.74s)]
*  The one that's hard to get that came from the middle of Africa. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3718.3399999999997s)]

*  Which model is that? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3728.3399999999997s)]
*  Seamaster. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3729.3399999999997s)]

*  That's an Ocratera. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3734.3399999999997s)]
*  $47,000. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3735.3399999999997s)]
*  That's a little pricey. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3736.3399999999997s)]
*  That's a fucking beautiful watch though. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3739.3399999999997s)]
*  Look at that goddamn thing. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3742.3399999999997s)]
*  That's $47,000. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3743.3399999999997s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3744.3399999999997s)]
*  It's because of the complications. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3745.3399999999997s)]
*  It's because of the complications though, for sure. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3746.94s)]
*  Is that one of the self-winders? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3747.94s)]
*  Well, I think it's got a compli- what is the complication on that? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3749.94s)]
*  Well, it probably looks like it's- if you go back to the dial, I'm sure it has the first picture. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3752.94s)]
*  Oh, it's a limited number. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3758.94s)]
*  I'm going to tell you the one Ari wants. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3760.94s)]
*  Make more, stupid. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3761.94s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3762.94s)]
*  Tommy, what's the one that Rolex made for Pan Am? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3763.94s)]
*  Rolex made a steel watch for Pan Am that for a comedian is the best watch and affordable. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3766.94s)]
*  It's dial up here, it's GMT. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3773.54s)]
*  And it's dial up here so that when you go on the road, you can change it and it'll tell you the time of where you are, but you can keep it on New York time. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3776.54s)]
*  Oh, you do the math. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3783.54s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3784.54s)]
*  I have no fucking idea. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3785.54s)]
*  New York is three hours later. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3786.54s)]
*  Yeah, that is a problem. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3788.54s)]
*  If you're a- [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3789.54s)]
*  This is the one you want Ari. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3790.54s)]
*  This is a beautiful watch. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3791.54s)]
*  That, you'll get robbed. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3792.54s)]
*  You'll get robbed. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3793.54s)]
*  No. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3794.54s)]
*  Shut the fuck up Ari. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3795.54s)]
*  Of course they'll rob you. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3796.54s)]
*  That's a goddamn Rolex. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3797.54s)]
*  If you have something that's under the radar, then you'll probably be alright. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3799.14s)]
*  It's a hot watch though. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3804.14s)]
*  It's a hot watch. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3805.14s)]
*  And for a comedian it's great. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3806.14s)]
*  You want something that doesn't look blingy. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3807.14s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want to turn people off with looking at your wrist. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3808.14s)]
*  You don't want it to be blingy. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3812.14s)]
*  You want it to be- [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3813.14s)]
*  Bert, you perform from far away from people. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3814.14s)]
*  I perform right up on people. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3815.14s)]
*  They'll see it. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3816.14s)]
*  Yeah, if you're right in the front row and some guys wearing a $50,000 watch, that's a little distracting. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3819.14s)]
*  You're looking at my arm the whole time. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3824.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3825.14s)]
*  But you always say you have trouble spending money and I don't believe it. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3826.74s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3829.74s)]
*  This is my favorite story. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3830.74s)]
*  That's another bullshit. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3831.74s)]
*  So I send Tom a text at this Rolex place in Vegas. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3832.74s)]
*  Story checks out. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3836.94s)]
*  And I text and I say, a picture of the watch and he goes, are you getting it? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3837.94s)]
*  And I said, I don't think so. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3841.1s)]
*  I have trouble spending money. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3842.22s)]

*  Except the guy from a Rolex store. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3845.22s)]
*  I leave the place. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3846.98s)]
*  Well, I like looking at him. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3847.98s)]
*  So I leave the place. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3848.98s)]
*  It must be fun for the dealer. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=3849.98s)]

*  The only thing I'm doing is England. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4923.38s)]
*  I'm going over to London. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4924.38s)]

*  At the end of the middle of the month. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4926.38s)]
*  Sober. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4927.38s)]
*  I'm going to go to London and almost kill that motherfucker. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4928.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4929.38s)]
*  That was his first trip out there. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4930.38s)]
*  He goes, how do I hang with Bert? [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4931.38s)]
*  I'm like, throw some drinks into a planter or something. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4932.38s)]
*  Yeah, he said that thing about you. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4936.38s)]
*  He's like, we get up, we drink, and the next morning I'm like, oh, I feel like I'm shitting [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4939.38s)]
*  blood. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4942.38s)]
*  And then Bert's like, you want to go for a run? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4943.38s)]
*  No. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4945.38s)]
*  Well, I think that's what keeps you healthy, that keeps you balanced, is that you do exercise. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4946.38s)]
*  Like, you put two stressors on your body. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4951.38s)]
*  You put the alcohol stressor, and then you jack up your metabolism and all your fucking [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4953.38s)]
*  hormones and everything for running and exercise. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4957.38s)]
*  It's the part that I miss, and it's weird because I don't have the punitive voice in [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4959.38s)]
*  my head. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4964.38s)]
*  Where I wake up, I go, all right, you did this yourself. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4965.38s)]
*  Let's fucking go. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4967.38s)]
*  Let's get up. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4968.38s)]
*  Like this morning, my alarm went off at 630, and I was like, I'll just keep sleeping. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4969.38s)]
*  I feel good. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4972.38s)]
*  I'll do the podcast. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4973.38s)]
*  I'll work out tonight. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4974.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4975.38s)]
*  But like, if I drank last night, I'd be up at 630 in the gym. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4976.38s)]
*  It would motivate you to go. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4980.38s)]
*  It motivates me to fucking work out. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4981.38s)]
*  Dude, that's great, man. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4982.38s)]
*  That's a great balance. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4983.38s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4984.38s)]
*  I wish you didn't drink as much. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4985.38s)]
*  That's what I was trying to tell you last night. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4986.38s)]
*  You should just smoke more weed. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4988.38s)]
*  Weed doesn't have the effect on your body. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4989.38s)]
*  That's what I miss the most during Sober October's weed. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4992.38s)]
*  I don't necessarily miss the booze. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4995.38s)]
*  My face looks better. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4997.38s)]
*  I don't have the deep bags under my eyes when I don't drink. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=4999.38s)]
*  I know it's doing something bad to me. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5002.38s)]
*  My brother sent me a picture of Bert. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5004.38s)]
*  He was like, oh, look, his skin looks better already. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5006.38s)]
*  And then I was laughing at it, but he goes, I was actually being serious. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5008.38s)]
*  My skin looks a lot better. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5011.38s)]
*  My skin looks better, and I deflate. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5013.38s)]
*  I deflate. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5015.38s)]
*  I was telling this to Ari. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5016.38s)]
*  The number one thing that I noticed, I deflate my face. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5017.38s)]
*  Inflammation. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5020.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's inflammation. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5021.38s)]
*  In a second. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5022.38s)]
*  I have had times where I've been partying so hard that my phone won't recognize my face. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5023.38s)]
*  Because I just bloated. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5030.38s)]
*  Jesus Christ, dude. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5031.38s)]
*  Really? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5033.38s)]
*  His phone is like, who the fuck is this? [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5034.38s)]
*  Who are you? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5036.38s)]
*  Who's this Chinese guy? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5037.38s)]
*  Yeah, you need a phone with a fingerprint thing. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5038.38s)]
*  You need to get an Android. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5040.38s)]
*  You know the thing that I feel like I try to tackle the most that I struggle with is sleep. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5041.38s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5046.38s)]
*  Just that overall, if you go like, I like working out. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5047.38s)]
*  So if I get into a habit of working out, it's not, I mean, the workouts can be challenging, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5050.38s)]
*  but it's not like, man, I don't like doing this. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5055.38s)]
*  So you tackle that. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5058.38s)]
*  And then eating, that could be a challenge. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5059.38s)]
*  But again, if you start like... [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5062.38s)]
*  Eating salads, you're fine. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5064.38s)]
*  Well, just start eating a healthy, you just build the habit. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5065.38s)]
*  The thing that is, I think, the hardest for me to master, and I try to like think about it more, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5068.38s)]
*  is just getting good sleep. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5074.38s)]
*  Have you ever tried one of those like eight sleep mattresses that cool you off? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5075.38s)]
*  No. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5079.38s)]
*  I have one and I haven't set it up yet, but every one that uses it says it's a fucking game changer. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5080.38s)]
*  I just try to think about it more too. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5086.38s)]
*  I realized that I used to think that sleep happens to you. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5088.38s)]
*  So you go like, tonight was good. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5092.38s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5093.38s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5094.38s)]
*  Like it just happens. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5095.38s)]
*  And sort of start thinking in terms of like, you know, I'm in charge of at least attempting to make this a good night of sleep. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5096.38s)]
*  Can I give you a tip? [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5105.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5106.38s)]
*  Don't look at your phone for an hour and a half before you go to sleep. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5107.38s)]
*  That's a good one. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5109.38s)]
*  That shit that's in there, it does something to your eyes. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5110.38s)]
*  I look at my phone right before I go to sleep. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5112.38s)]
*  I sleep like a brick. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5113.38s)]
*  You're a monkey. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5114.38s)]
*  I listen to podcasts while I sleep. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5115.38s)]
*  You do? [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5116.38s)]
*  And then have dreams that I'm fucking in history. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5117.38s)]
*  My wife has a hard time sleeping. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5120.38s)]
*  It drives her crazy. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5121.38s)]
*  I could fall asleep on the dirt. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5122.38s)]
*  Yeah, I can't. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5123.38s)]
*  I could just lay down on dirt ground. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5124.38s)]
*  Have you guys started the withdrawal dreams yet? [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5125.38s)]
*  I had one last night. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5128.38s)]

*  I just started. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5130.38s)]
*  My withdrawal dreams are horrific, like being chased by wolves and shit. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5131.38s)]
*  What? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5133.38s)]

*  All my withdrawal dreams from marijuana. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5135.38s)]
*  I have not had any withdrawal dreams. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5137.38s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5138.38s)]
*  I think it probably reveals to me who you are. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5139.38s)]
*  They're so violent. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5140.38s)]
*  They're so crazy. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5141.38s)]

*  That's so nuts. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5145.38s)]
*  My dream, last night my dream was that Aaron Judge came in for a pinch hit home run. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5146.38s)]
*  Oh, my last game. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5151.38s)]
*  Really? [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5152.38s)]

*  I got 63. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5154.38s)]
*  I'm being chased by wolves and I'm trying to figure out if I should climb a tree. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5155.38s)]
*  I fought a dude because he was pissed off that I fucked up his boat. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5158.34s)]
*  Wow. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5161.38s)]
*  They're all violent. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5162.38s)]
*  But I've been involved in violence for so long. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5163.38s)]
*  Yeah, you witness violence a lot. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5165.9800000000005s)]
*  I am so used to people getting injured. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5167.9800000000005s)]
*  I've told this story before, but one time my wife, we had a hatchback and she was taking [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5170.18s)]
*  something out of the back of the trunk and she stood up and she didn't know that the [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5175.400000000001s)]
*  corner of the hatchback was right there and she cut her head and she's bleeding. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5178.1s)]
*  Pouring blood down her face and I look at her and I'm like, it's nothing. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5183.139999999999s)]
*  It's like a tiny little cut. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5186.179999999999s)]
*  It didn't bother me at all. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5188.54s)]
*  I was like, that's nothing. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5190.099999999999s)]
*  You could put some crazy glue on it or we can go to the doctor. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5191.099999999999s)]
*  She's like, fucking crazy glue? [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5193.139999999999s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with you? [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5194.42s)]
*  You have some sympathy. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5196.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm thinking about what I would do. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5197.0199999999995s)]
*  If I look at that cut, I would go, we got crazy glue. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5198.74s)]
*  I'll put a little crazy glue in there and squeeze it together and put a little bandaid [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5200.9s)]
*  on it. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5203.42s)]
*  That'd be all right. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5204.42s)]
*  But I'm so used to seeing people injured. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5205.42s)]
*  She's got to know that's your love language. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5206.42s)]
*  I've seen a thousand people knocked unconscious. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5207.94s)]
*  I'm real close. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5212.419999999999s)]
*  In front of her. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5213.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5214.7s)]
*  From three feet away. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5215.7s)]
*  I'm so accustomed to it. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5217.0199999999995s)]
*  That's what I give. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5218.5s)]
*  I know you'll never write a self-help book, but I want to find the motivators that cause [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5219.5s)]
*  greatness. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5224.58s)]
*  I liked Cam Haynes' book because he talked about his father and his relationship with [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5226.74s)]
*  his father, his father being a runner and how that... [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5230.099999999999s)]
*  And ultimately how that drives him to run because it's something he's trying to... [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5233.7s)]
*  I can connect with broken parts of men where I can find that brokenness in me and go, oh [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5237.7s)]
*  shit, because I was like, oh, maybe that's why I fucking run. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5243.5s)]
*  My dad was a runner. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5246.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5247.34s)]
*  And then you start going, oh, this is normal. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5248.34s)]
*  This is part of... [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5250.099999999999s)]
*  I'd be curious to know, because you're a pretty weird dude with motivation. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5252.099999999999s)]
*  What motivates you to work out is like, well, I think about people raping my family. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5257.38s)]
*  I would love to get to the base... [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5260.58s)]
*  I don't think about people raping my family. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5261.58s)]
*  Yeah, you do. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5263.58s)]

*  You said like, I think about people trying to kill me. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5271.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5273.54s)]
*  You said that before. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5274.54s)]
*  Well, I definitely do if I'm getting tired. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5275.54s)]
*  Bird puts himself in a place. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5276.54s)]
*  So if I'm in the middle of a workout and I'm tired, I say, imagine if I had saved a loved [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5277.54s)]
*  one's life right now. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5281.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5282.58s)]
*  Like, how would I respond? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5283.58s)]
*  I just get angry. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5284.58s)]
*  And I'm sure there's rape in there. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5285.58s)]
*  That's why I met. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5286.58s)]
*  I don't think about that. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5287.58s)]
*  Bird puts himself in the place of the attacker and he goes, well, if I was there, I may as [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5288.58s)]
*  well get some rape, son. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5292.58s)]
*  I'm killing you. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5293.58s)]
*  I might rape you too. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5294.58s)]
*  I mean, it's not like an extra charge. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5295.58s)]
*  I'm going to jail forever. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5297.34s)]
*  Whenever you see a serial killer who doesn't rape you, you're like, what the fuck are you [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5298.34s)]

*  When you took your shirt off last night on stage and the place went nuts, there was a [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5523.1s)]
*  lady in the front row that got up and started doing this. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5525.9400000000005s)]
*  I didn't have to say his name. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5528.580000000001s)]
*  I was like, hey, this is my friend. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5529.9800000000005s)]
*  And then just, you just walked. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5531.42s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I want to introduce you. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5532.78s)]
*  They went crazy. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5533.78s)]
*  They went crazy. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5534.78s)]
*  And then you took the shirt off and took it to another level. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5535.78s)]
*  That was great fun last night. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5538.26s)]
*  That was a lot of fun. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5539.26s)]
*  That was great fun last night. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5540.26s)]
*  That was so much fun. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5541.26s)]
*  It's really important to do, I've found since the last time I did a spot there, it's really [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5542.26s)]
*  important to do short sets to stay loose in what your, in what your, your talent is, but [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5546.3s)]
*  it does not translate to theaters or arenas. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5553.5s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5556.1s)]
*  Like the energy. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5557.1s)]
*  So much more conversational. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5558.1s)]
*  So much more fun, so much more interactive. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5559.780000000001s)]
*  And then you go to an arena and you're like, if you talk to one person in the front row, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5562.54s)]
*  then there's fucking 12,000 other people going, what the, I don't know what that guy looks [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5566.700000000001s)]
*  like. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5570.780000000001s)]
*  No, it's definitely different. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5571.780000000001s)]
*  Tommy was the first person. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5572.780000000001s)]
*  When I started doing theaters, Tom texted me and was like, he called me and you're like, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5573.780000000001s)]
*  just letting you know, it's a different pacing. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5579.14s)]
*  It's a different, it's a little bit of a different muscle. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5581.5s)]
*  And I was like, no, no, I got this. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5583.9800000000005s)]
*  And I remember my first theater gig, I was done in 35 minutes. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5584.9800000000005s)]
*  And I was like, whoa, he's right. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5589.9400000000005s)]
*  And I was like, I don't have that much material. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5591.18s)]
*  Like I have a lot of fucking around with an audience and hey, ask him a question I already [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5593.34s)]
*  have the answer to then, you know, that's the energy. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5598.46s)]
*  When you do theater, you like, you got to fucking present it. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5601.26s)]
*  It's an act. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5603.620000000001s)]
*  Especially arenas. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5604.620000000001s)]
*  I told Tony, you got to do the bits. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5605.620000000001s)]
*  Like you got to do the written, the best stuff. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5607.34s)]
*  But you also, on the other side is you hold laughs longer. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5609.1s)]
*  And it's important to do that because the people are still thinking about what you just [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5613.06s)]
*  said. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5615.9400000000005s)]
*  He was doing his first theater, I think with Jeff Ross or something. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5617.0599999999995s)]
*  And I was like, slow down. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5619.259999999999s)]
*  And he goes, okay. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5620.259999999999s)]
*  And then I was like, hey, Tony, slow down. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5621.259999999999s)]
*  And then he's like, okay. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5624.259999999999s)]
*  And then he was afterwards, like that was really good advice. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5625.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a different thing. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5627.98s)]
*  But I think it's like cross training. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5629.94s)]
*  I think if you just do those, it's not good. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5631.379999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5633.98s)]
*  Because it's very difficult to come up with new material. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5634.98s)]
*  You're not coming up with shit when you're doing 16,000 people. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5636.5s)]
*  No, exactly. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5639.419999999999s)]
*  And you're in the round. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5640.419999999999s)]
*  You ain't coming up with any new ideas. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5641.419999999999s)]
*  Geraldo talked about it. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5643.299999999999s)]
*  He said it's like, it's almost a different sport. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5644.299999999999s)]
*  Like, especially in town, like in town club comedy where you're like not the show. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5646.780000000001s)]
*  And you're on top of them. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5652.06s)]
*  Versus headline. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5653.06s)]
*  If you're the seller, the audience is literally where you guys are. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5654.06s)]
*  They're on top of you. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5657.22s)]
*  You also feel like you could take a little bit of a risk in those big ass arenas, like [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5658.22s)]
*  a new line or something. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5664.26s)]
*  And it doesn't land. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5665.66s)]
*  And you immediately are like, I'm going right back to what I know. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5666.66s)]
*  Right back to the real shit. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5669.18s)]
*  I don't know how anybody who just does arenas ever comes up with new material. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5671.42s)]
*  You can write. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5675.58s)]
*  You can write in those. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5676.58s)]
*  I always do my new hours out on the road. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5677.58s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm sure. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5681.14s)]
*  But it's not as easy. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5682.14s)]
*  If you try like an on the edge joke at like the stand or somewhere they don't know you [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5683.46s)]
*  and then like they don't go for it, like you're just not going to get them back. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5687.66s)]
*  They're like, we've lost faith in you. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5690.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know who you are. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5692.22s)]
*  I don't like this. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5693.22s)]
*  That's very true. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5694.22s)]
*  That happened to me in the OR the other night. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5695.22s)]
*  OR can be a fucking tricky whore who passes out in the middle of fucking. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5696.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5702.02s)]
*  What? [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5703.02s)]
*  I'll allow it. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5704.620000000001s)]
*  Oh, like tricky whore who passes out in the middle of fucking. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5705.620000000001s)]
*  You should call the doctor. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5707.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5708.660000000001s)]
*  She's probably having a fentanyl overdose. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5709.660000000001s)]
*  It's a good special. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5710.660000000001s)]
*  I've had that. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5711.660000000001s)]
*  There's the OR sets that have gone down. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5713.780000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5715.860000000001s)]
*  Especially if you go, I'm going to work on a bit here. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5716.860000000001s)]
*  And then you start and you're like, and then every word that comes out of your mouth feels [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5720.06s)]
*  so scripted. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5724.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5725.860000000001s)]
*  And you're like, I'm trying to work. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5726.860000000001s)]
*  God damn it. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5728.42s)]
*  Why won't you guys just go with me for a second? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5729.42s)]
*  You start feeling like a phony. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5730.42s)]
*  And then you bail on it. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5731.42s)]

*  Like when I open for you and I'd be presentational and stuff, and then you come back to, or just [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5734.82s)]

*  And then you're like. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5748.74s)]

*  It was hilarious. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5760.42s)]
*  It was hilarious because it was like, you know, just a young guy who was just a little [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5761.42s)]
*  too eager and wanted to like chime in too. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5764.74s)]

*  I'm going to eat a lot of food. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5957.62s)]
*  I'm going to eat a lot of food. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5958.62s)]
*  I'm going to eat a lot of food. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5959.62s)]
*  So I look at what he eats. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5961.58s)]
*  So I'm like, I'll eat that. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5962.58s)]
*  What are we doing today? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5963.58s)]
*  What workouts are we doing? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5964.58s)]
*  I just do what he does in the workouts. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5965.58s)]
*  So you're just following someone's example. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5967.0199999999995s)]
*  And then it becomes like a habit. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5968.34s)]
*  That's definitely easier to like farm it off to someone. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5970.0199999999995s)]

*  No, that's Sean. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5985.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5986.78s)]
*  That's cool that you guys cut your hair like and looked like each other. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5987.78s)]
*  They're like, you guys brothers? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5988.94s)]

*  Pretty fucking similar. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5996.7s)]
*  But that is a huge thing that you could do to bring someone on the road with you and [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=5997.7s)]
*  train with them. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6002.5s)]

*  It's much better, man. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6021.339999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm going for another follow up for the nerve stuff in like a couple weeks, but [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6022.339999999999s)]
*  it's... [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6026.419999999999s)]
*  Do you like that? [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6027.419999999999s)]
*  Put your hand out there. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6028.419999999999s)]
*  And you can clutch and everything? [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6029.419999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6030.74s)]
*  All good? [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6031.74s)]
*  Shout out to your doctor. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6032.74s)]
*  Yeah, Dr. Saruja did this one. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6033.74s)]
*  Your grip strength is definitely still weaker than the right hand. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6036.5s)]
*  And there is weight where your wrist will eventually collapse. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6041.339999999999s)]
*  Do you do wrist curls? [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6045.9s)]
*  The weight will... [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6047.7s)]
*  So like if I'm holding dumbbells, you know, and I can hold them, but at a certain weight, [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6049.3s)]
*  let's say they're like 60 pound dumbbells or something, I'll be fine here and you'll [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6055.42s)]
*  see this one just will start to go like that. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6059.9400000000005s)]
*  Do you do wrist curls? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6061.9400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6063.9400000000005s)]
*  Is it still recuperating? [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6064.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's a three year recovery. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6065.9400000000005s)]
*  The nerve is... [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6066.9400000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6067.9400000000005s)]
*  You know what I love, man, is rollers. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6068.9400000000005s)]
*  Where you got a roller with a cord and the weight's at the bottom and you do this shit. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6069.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6074.14s)]
*  And you lost that basketball game before? [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6075.9400000000005s)]
*  You were already losing or? [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6077.34s)]
*  No, well we'd lost the game then we did our dumbbells. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6078.740000000001s)]
*  Tate Fletcher gave me a great speech about getting hurt because we all went on this crazy [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6084.740000000001s)]
*  hike and he was like, you know how I talk out my ass and Tate is just not having it. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6089.9800000000005s)]
*  And he was like, you're a decommissioned athlete. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6095.18s)]
*  He's like, you think your body is what it was when you were a kid and it's not and that's [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6097.14s)]
*  how you get fucking hurt. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6101.46s)]
*  That's how you get hurt. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6102.46s)]
*  Do you think you can do everything you could do when you're a kid because you can do it [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6104.0199999999995s)]
*  when you're a kid? [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6106.0199999999995s)]
*  You can't do it. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6107.0199999999995s)]
*  That's how you get hurt. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6108.0199999999995s)]
*  And I was like, if that was the first time I was like, oh, that's what happened when [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6109.0199999999995s)]
*  we played basketball. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6111.0199999999995s)]
*  100% what happened. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6112.0199999999995s)]
*  And we also did something that, I mean, it's exactly what he's saying, but especially when [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6113.0199999999995s)]
*  you get into jumping. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6117.78s)]
*  Yeah, I have to say that. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6119.0199999999995s)]
*  If you don't jump all the time and then you go, I'm going to jump my ass off today. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6120.72s)]
*  You have explosive movement, but you don't have explosive strength. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6124.14s)]
*  So it's like in between time, like a 75 year old would never think to jump. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6126.94s)]
*  Of course. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6130.82s)]
*  Stabilizer muscles. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6132.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6133.0599999999995s)]
*  You got to like work it. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6134.0599999999995s)]
*  We played basketball last week though, played two on two and played full game. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6135.0599999999995s)]
*  And how, what are you going to drop down to? [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6138.58s)]
*  Do you have a goal? [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6140.94s)]
*  No, because you know, I, I remember like, like being real fat as a freshman in college [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6141.94s)]
*  and losing weight and being and thinking that a number was the goal. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6146.78s)]
*  Like at first I was like, I was like, I want to wait 225 because I, I saw like NFL linebackers. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6150.82s)]
*  I was like, that's a good weight. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6155.94s)]
*  And then I got down to 225. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6158.259999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I don't look like them. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6159.94s)]
*  So I just kept losing weight. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6161.4s)]
*  And I like, even now like I'm like 208, 209, and I feel like if I go, oh, it's too, I'd [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6163.4s)]
*  rather just focus on what I feel like and look like and go like, that's the way that [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6170.2s)]
*  I'd rather be at then hunt the number. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6173.839999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6176.0s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6177.0s)]
*  I think, I think I'll [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6178.0s)]
*  Cause also like your gaining muscle. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6179.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6180.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6181.0s)]
*  So your weight is getting higher, but your body fat's getting lower. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6182.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6183.32s)]
*  So I don't know what the final number will be. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6184.32s)]
*  I think it's definitely, I'm, I'm, I have a build that I should be like between 190 [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6186.6s)]
*  and 200, I think, you know, that's what I think I should be. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6191.8s)]
*  And so that's like, kind of like the range. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6194.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6197.84s)]
*  But as you're putting on muscle, I mean, it might, maybe you'll be heavier. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6198.84s)]
*  Maybe I'll be heavier. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6201.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6202.4400000000005s)]

*  In the zone. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6414.92s)]
*  I'd be curious if you looked at my form [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6415.759999999999s)]
*  in my archery in that trick shot. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6417.08s)]
*  If you go, he knows what he's doing. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6419.32s)]
*  Well, it's a different kind of archery [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6420.96s)]
*  because what you're doing is traditional archery. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6422.4s)]
*  What I do is like compound archery. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6424.44s)]
*  My shit is like, I use like a range finder [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6426.36s)]
*  and I have a scale on my sight where I rank, [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6429.74s)]
*  like it's 65 yards, I'll dial it into 65 yards. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6433.08s)]
*  And I'm shooting at 85 yards to an index card. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6436.04s)]
*  So at 85 yards, I'm shooting at something that's this big. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6439.32s)]
*  You couldn't do it the way you do it, Bert. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6442.28s)]
*  It's a different thing. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6443.88s)]
*  You'd be different in just regular both. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6444.719999999999s)]
*  We went out skiing shooting. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6445.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know how to shoot traditional archery. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6446.48s)]
*  I'm terrible at it. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6449.0s)]
*  I was with my family. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6449.84s)]
*  We were in Hawaii and they have this archery course. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6450.66s)]
*  Oh really, is that different? [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6453.16s)]
*  Yeah, well I mean I could do it, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6454.5599999999995s)]
*  but I don't know how to aim. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6456.16s)]
*  It's more. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6457.92s)]
*  You're supposed to aim, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6458.759999999999s)]
*  the way I do it is with compound bow. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6459.599999999999s)]
*  And I pull it back and it's all centered to, [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6462.42s)]
*  the bow is matched to my frame. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6466.0s)]
*  So I have a 28 and a half inch draw [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6468.56s)]
*  because that's how far my arms are [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6471.04s)]
*  when they're fully extended. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6472.400000000001s)]
*  And then the peep sight is at exactly 5.7 inches here [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6473.72s)]
*  and I'm looking through this thing [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6479.0s)]
*  and I center the housing with it. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6480.96s)]
*  It's like you're balancing all these things out together. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6482.72s)]
*  It's very zen because in that moment, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6486.240000000001s)]
*  you're not thinking about anything else [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6488.740000000001s)]
*  other than the execution of the shot [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6490.84s)]
*  and making sure it releases perfectly. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6492.88s)]
*  And it's just, there's something about thinking [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6495.280000000001s)]
*  about something that overcomes, [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6497.48s)]
*  that's jujitsu and archery and pool. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6500.32s)]
*  You don't think about anything else other than that thing [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6503.0s)]
*  while you're doing it. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6505.36s)]
*  And that is sort of like a moving meditation. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6506.32s)]
*  Archery in many ways is like a moving meditation [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6509.0199999999995s)]
*  because you're so engrossed in the technique [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6512.36s)]
*  that you don't think about anything else. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6515.879999999999s)]
*  None, no life issues, nothing else. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6517.799999999999s)]
*  And even if you never hunt [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6520.24s)]
*  or never do a competition or something, [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6522.9s)]
*  there's something about shooting a target [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6524.36s)]
*  over and over again. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6526.0599999999995s)]
*  It just clears your mind. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6528.0s)]
*  Now the cool thing about what you do from my perspective [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6528.96s)]
*  and you and Cam and all those guys, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6531.84s)]
*  the thing I think is sexy is the fucking, [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6534.679999999999s)]
*  the seeing it and then your heart's racing, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6537.679999999999s)]
*  holding your breath, keeping your breath, tracking it. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6541.0s)]
*  Like I've watched a lot of those [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6543.78s)]
*  like Ronella videos on Netflix. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6545.48s)]
*  The energy that happens that moment, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6548.76s)]
*  because it's almost like finding a needle in a haystack. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6550.639999999999s)]
*  You finally see an elk and then you gotta apply [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6552.88s)]
*  all the shit you do in your range. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6555.5s)]
*  You gotta apply it when you haven't slept well. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6556.72s)]
*  You haven't slept well, you slept on a rock, [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6559.56s)]
*  your fucking nerves are up, you get one fucking shot. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6561.240000000001s)]
*  That's the cool shit. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6564.72s)]
*  You gotta be still, your heart's gotta be still. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6565.64s)]
*  There's a lot going on, man. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6568.12s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6569.4800000000005s)]
*  But it's also, it's obsessive. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6570.42s)]
*  You get obsessed by it. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6573.240000000001s)]
*  And I think there's something about obsession [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6574.64s)]
*  that's good for the mind. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6576.400000000001s)]
*  Like getting like really focused on things. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6578.0s)]
*  It keeps your mind active in a very unusual way. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6580.02s)]
*  You got something like that that you like? [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6583.280000000001s)]
*  Jerking off? [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6586.04s)]
*  Maybe stand up, I don't know. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6587.04s)]
*  Yeah, stand up. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6588.32s)]
*  Stand up, oh. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6589.16s)]
*  I'm helping Big Jay do his special now. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6590.24s)]
*  And that's all I think about. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6592.5599999999995s)]
*  Is just like making sure everything's running right. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6594.48s)]
*  Yeah, shit like that. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6597.04s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6598.0s)]
*  Watching him in, when fully loaded, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6598.84s)]
*  and he was in, for the first time I saw him in an arena. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6601.72s)]
*  Big Jay, you know Big Jay is always the guy fucks around, [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6604.8s)]
*  little fucking buzz on stage, fuck around with the audience. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6608.36s)]
*  12,000 people, he sits on a stool. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6612.64s)]
*  And destroyed me, Shane, David Tell, [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6615.48s)]
*  we're back there watching him like, [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6619.68s)]
*  and murdered, and just didn't move. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6621.44s)]
*  Big Jay, one leg out, one leg up on the stool, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6624.2s)]
*  Eagles jersey, just fucking destroyed. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6626.76s)]
*  He's a fucking pro. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6629.4s)]
*  He is such a pro. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6630.32s)]
*  And he had this weird training where he'd always go on [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6631.16s)]
*  after a tell late night at the cellar. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6633.72s)]
*  And he'd also like open for like corn and stuff. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6635.92s)]
*  So he's doing these like massive venues. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6638.22s)]
*  He opened for corn? [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6640.72s)]
*  On their tour, on their like, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6641.5599999999995s)]
*  some music festival kind of tour. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6643.96s)]
*  He did one of the hardest things too, [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6645.4400000000005s)]
*  where we did the oddball tour a few years ago. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6646.88s)]
*  He would open that. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6649.24s)]
*  And everybody's like, fuck that. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6651.04s)]
*  Like nobody wants to do it. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6653.76s)]
*  And he embraced it and like, you know, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6655.4800000000005s)]
*  you have people being sad and all this shit. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6656.76s)]
*  He would fucking kill it. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6659.04s)]
*  We went out, we went out, we had to introduce a big band [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6659.88s)]
*  at Rock in the Range in Columbus, I think. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6661.8s)]
*  And it was like 20,000 people out there. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6663.84s)]
*  And the two of us went out, just to say also, [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6666.2s)]
*  we have a comedy show. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6668.58s)]

*  I'm like, what the fuck? [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6671.56s)]
*  And then somebody's like, [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6673.44s)]
*  somebody like yelled out from the crowd something. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6674.36s)]
*  And Jay just rips in, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6676.24s)]

*  Help me, please. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6682.839999999999s)]
*  We had him for Fully Loaded. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6683.679999999999s)]
*  He was gonna host all the shows. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6685.04s)]
*  Just host them, because he's so good at it. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6686.28s)]
*  And that first night he went out and did it. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6688.24s)]
*  Because he missed the first night, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=6690.16s)]

*  We had dinner, and then I got in the car [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7152.38s)]
*  and I drove both of us home. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7154.0599999999995s)]

*  my pajamas, I got excited for pajamas, [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7160.54s)]
*  and then I laid in bed and I woke up. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7161.78s)]
*  And that's the thing I wish I could get a hold of [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7163.42s)]
*  where I just go, oh, tonight's not a night [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7167.18s)]
*  I'm chasing drinks. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7170.58s)]
*  So there's pros and cons, right? [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7171.82s)]
*  So the pros of drinking all the time [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7173.58s)]
*  is you're the life of the party. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7175.74s)]
*  All right, you're the guy. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7177.38s)]
*  You're the guy, you go on stage. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7178.26s)]
*  You get to live life, you get to see [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7180.1s)]
*  in other people's eyes. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7180.94s)]
*  But you can do that once in a while. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7181.78s)]
*  There's a rant that you did that is on a video somewhere [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7183.46s)]
*  of you talking about how you love drinking. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7186.82s)]

*  It's so great. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7191.7s)]
*  It's a love letter to alcohol. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7192.54s)]
*  It's a love letter to that feeling that we all get [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7194.46s)]
*  when you have a couple of cocktails and you see a sunrise. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7196.74s)]
*  And it's just like, ah, or a sunset. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7199.34s)]
*  And you see just, it's something beautiful. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7201.3s)]
*  It's like, there's a feeling when you just start [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7202.82s)]
*  to catch a buzz that is such a fucking beautiful feeling. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7204.82s)]

*  and being like, I'm glad I have friends that made this fun. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7382.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7385.4800000000005s)]
*  Me and Ari went down. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7386.32s)]
*  Well you were worried at first. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7387.16s)]
*  You thought it was an intervention. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7388.0s)]
*  It was. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7389.8s)]
*  I went home after that. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7390.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7392.16s)]
*  Joe, you get in serious mode sometimes. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7393.0s)]
*  Where like, where, [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7394.5599999999995s)]
*  it's not fun anymore. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7397.96s)]
*  You're like, you pull me aside and you grab me like, [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7398.84s)]
*  hey, just so you know, you don't have to do this. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7400.72s)]
*  And I was like, the fuck is, you're making it real. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7403.24s)]
*  I laid in bed that night after that first Sober October thing. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7405.48s)]
*  Laid in bed and I go, I think I just ruined my career. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7409.28s)]
*  Well can I tell you why I did that? [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7411.16s)]
*  Because my doctor friend told me that you could die. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7412.64s)]
*  He said there's one thing that does actually kill people [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7415.2s)]
*  and it's withdrawal from alcohol. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7418.12s)]
*  Yeah, we all were really actually legit worried. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7420.28s)]
*  Like that could happen. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7422.68s)]
*  There's two drugs that kill people when they get off of them. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7423.5199999999995s)]
*  Benzodiazepine is one of them. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7425.64s)]
*  Benzo's Xanax. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7427.64s)]
*  Xanax actually can kill people if you get off of it. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7429.36s)]
*  If you just, your body becomes so addicted to it [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7432.2s)]
*  that when you get off of it, [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7434.48s)]
*  your body just fucking freaks out and you die. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7435.44s)]
*  And that shows you how great Benzos are. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7437.56s)]
*  Well that's what happened to Jordan Peterson. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7439.72s)]
*  That's what happened to Jordan Peterson. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7441.8s)]
*  What was he up to? [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7442.92s)]
*  Do you know what he was consuming? [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7443.76s)]
*  He doesn't really discuss that. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7445.04s)]
*  He's a little tight lipped about that. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7446.76s)]
*  It's gotta be significant for people to go through. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7448.92s)]
*  I do not know. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7450.84s)]
*  You know, and I was sad that he did it in the first place [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7451.68s)]
*  because I think he didn't understand the withdrawal. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7454.24s)]
*  No one understands with Benzos [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7457.84s)]
*  because the doctor prescribes it. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7459.64s)]
*  They always give you like one milligram [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7461.28s)]
*  and then you're like, oh wow, you take that one milligram [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7462.88s)]
*  and it's overwhelming. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7465.28s)]
*  And then slowly but surely that one milligram. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7466.68s)]
*  What does it do? [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7468.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7470.56s)]
*  It's like Jesus. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7471.400000000001s)]
*  You've done it? [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7472.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7473.06s)]
*  What does it feel like? [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7473.900000000001s)]
*  It's the greatest feeling of all. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7474.72s)]
*  Xanax is? [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7475.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's a, I mean it literally, [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7476.400000000001s)]
*  imagine yourself being very anxious [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7478.08s)]
*  and it's just being eliminated. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7479.96s)]
*  But doesn't it rebound until your anxiety increases [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7481.4s)]
*  when you get off of it? [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7484.839999999999s)]
*  Well. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7485.679999999999s)]
*  That's what I've heard. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7486.5s)]
*  I mean, it's short lasting. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7487.339999999999s)]
*  They're not, the thing about Xanax itself [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7488.799999999999s)]
*  is that it's fast acting. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7491.36s)]
*  So it hits you pretty quickly and if it's strong, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7492.78s)]
*  not only would it reduce your anxiety, [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7495.96s)]
*  but you would get like a buzz of sorts. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7497.32s)]
*  Like you feel good. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7500.5599999999995s)]
*  Can be addictive. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7502.32s)]
*  But like people take different quantities of it. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7503.2s)]
*  So taking like a milligram is actually a strong dose. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7505.96s)]
*  If I ever take one, I take .25. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7509.52s)]
*  How often do you take it? [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7511.8s)]
*  I still have the same 30 that was prescribed to me [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7513.76s)]
*  from like two years ago. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7516.16s)]
*  So you can just do it every now and then and not do it. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7517.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7520.36s)]
*  I had a problem with it. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7521.2s)]
*  I had a problem with it, legit problem. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7522.04s)]
*  And Liam. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7523.32s)]
*  Dom Herrera was taking quite a bit of it. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7524.16s)]
*  He was taking it a lot, but he said it made him feel great. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7525.36s)]
*  He said just to leave. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7527.92s)]
*  He was having like issues. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7528.76s)]
*  Panic anxiety. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7530.36s)]
*  Oh, with a glass of white wine? [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7531.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7532.76s)]
*  If you start drinking on it. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7533.6s)]
*  I'll tell you what fucking all anxiety goes away [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7534.42s)]
*  when I do hard cardio all the time. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7537.18s)]
*  And this, well, we were talking about this last night [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7539.3s)]
*  is that one of the things that's coming out [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7541.5s)]
*  of this Sober October thing that came out of the last time [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7543.14s)]
*  when we had the fitness challenge [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7545.78s)]
*  and you and I talked about this. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7546.74s)]
*  There's a thing that happens [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7548.3s)]
*  when you do that hard cardio every day [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7549.34s)]
*  where you don't give a fuck. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7551.3s)]
*  It's true. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7552.86s)]
*  It's easier. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7553.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7554.58s)]
*  It gets easier to do the hard cardio [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7555.42s)]
*  because you get in shape. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7556.7s)]
*  But the, you were talking about the inner chatter. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7557.54s)]
*  Yeah, because all, you know, stress, anxiety, [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7560.5s)]
*  everybody has different degrees of it. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7563.5s)]
*  But when you're doing hard workouts, [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7565.34s)]
*  like when you fucking like gas yourself, you're done, [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7567.54s)]
*  and you do it consistently, like nothing really. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7571.34s)]
*  It's just hard to stay consistent [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7574.82s)]
*  and to recognize that that really is like a medicine. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7576.34s)]
*  But it's like a medicine. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7578.38s)]
*  It does leave you feeling like you can't think about other stuff. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7579.38s)]
*  So what's the exercise for you? [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7581.98s)]
*  For me, it's cardio. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7583.38s)]
*  No, no, no, like out of all the cardio is not running, [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7584.86s)]
*  is it the rowing machine or the bike? [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7587.9s)]
*  Well, I have a knee issue that it fucks with me when I run [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7589.42s)]
*  and I've been getting stem cells in it. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7592.46s)]
*  I fixed my right knee, waist to well, [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7594.22s)]
*  shout out to waist to well. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7596.26s)]
*  My right knee is 100% now, zero problems. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7597.58s)]
*  And I had a torn meniscus in it. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7600.42s)]
*  It was swell sometimes and I get like a cyst. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7602.18s)]
*  I got it drained like six, seven times. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7604.9s)]
*  It was a real problem. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7607.46s)]
*  It's gone now. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7608.3s)]
*  Like I can do everything. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7609.26s)]
*  I can do one legged. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7610.86s)]
*  Yeah, shout out. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7611.9s)]

*  Stem cells are amazing. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7617.1s)]
*  But what's the actual exercise? [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7618.18s)]
*  For me, the only way I can find myself pushing it [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7620.139999999999s)]
*  to where I'm going like I'm about to throw up [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7623.66s)]

*  Rowing machines are great. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7627.7s)]
*  Rowing machines are great. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7628.54s)]
*  I honestly need an outside motivator. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7629.379999999999s)]
*  So if it's just me trying to get in shape, [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7631.66s)]
*  it's like why not quit? [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7633.419999999999s)]
*  Why today? [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7635.0599999999995s)]
*  But if it's when I'm competing against you guys, [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7635.9s)]
*  when I'm like I have to do this from an outside push, [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7638.259999999999s)]
*  then I can keep going. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7641.419999999999s)]
*  But the specific exercise. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7642.259999999999s)]
*  My wife gets very uncomfortable [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7643.099999999999s)]
*  when we start doing these things. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7644.82s)]
*  Oh, your wife. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7646.5s)]
*  My wife gets scared of me being obsessed. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7648.66s)]
*  Nobody's significant other here in my sis. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7651.099999999999s)]
*  During the fucking Sober October Fitness Challenge, [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7653.339999999999s)]
*  I went off the rails. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7656.38s)]
*  It was nuts. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7657.94s)]
*  My wife gets me sober once a year [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7659.5s)]
*  and all I do is talk about you guys. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7662.219999999999s)]
*  Show her, text her pictures of Joe shirtless [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7666.259999999999s)]
*  and she's like hey, don't let this happen again. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7668.339999999999s)]
*  Have fun with it. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7670.74s)]
*  Just stay healthy. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7671.62s)]
*  Let's get healthy. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7672.46s)]
*  Yeah, well that's why we mitigated that [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7673.299999999999s)]
*  by making this not a contest. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7674.74s)]
*  I signed up from a gym to build a workout [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7677.94s)]
*  and they're like oh, we haven't seen you here [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7681.099999999999s)]
*  since October 30th, 2019. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7682.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7688.3s)]
*  I think for me, that tank, I love that Torque Fitness Tank. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7689.139999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's great. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7692.38s)]
*  That thing really feels, I don't know, it feels amazing. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7693.219999999999s)]
*  The what? [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7696.54s)]
*  It's a sled that you push or pull. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7697.38s)]
*  I love that. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7700.139999999999s)]
*  We have one out here. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7700.98s)]
*  I'll show it to you afterwards. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7701.82s)]
*  Like a tackle? [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7702.66s)]
*  Well it has resistance. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7703.5s)]
*  You can ramp up the resistance. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7704.860000000001s)]
*  Resistance levers. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7705.7s)]
*  Jamie, pull it up. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7706.54s)]
*  Torque makes it. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7707.9400000000005s)]
*  It's one of the best fitness tools. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7708.78s)]
*  So you push that thing. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7711.5s)]
*  That guy looks just like you. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7712.78s)]
*  And then you also can put a strap on it [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7714.26s)]
*  and you pull it backwards. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7717.1s)]
*  It has different, and then it has a rope. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7718.46s)]
*  Put a fuckin' lawnmower on there [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7720.06s)]
*  and do two things at once. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7721.54s)]
*  The whole time I thought, why didn't you put your own lawnmower? [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7724.74s)]
*  That was every comment on that thing. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7727.46s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not as difficult. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7729.860000000001s)]
*  The Torque Machine's difficult. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7731.860000000001s)]
*  I think that really fuckin' takes me to that level [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7733.22s)]
*  of like, holy shit, is mitts or a bag. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7736.54s)]
*  Oh yeah, man. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7739.900000000001s)]
*  Really going ham on that. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7740.740000000001s)]
*  I don't have any coordination punching. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7743.14s)]
*  I really look like a chick. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7745.5s)]
*  I can show you that easy. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7746.780000000001s)]
*  That is hilarious what you're just doing right now. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7747.780000000001s)]
*  Get the wrists. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7749.5s)]
*  Oh, in my movie I think I had my fingers, [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7750.34s)]
*  or I was doing this. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7754.7s)]
*  And they were like, yo. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7755.9800000000005s)]
*  Dude, I could teach you that pretty easy. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7757.06s)]
*  You just burned yourself. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7758.820000000001s)]
*  I guarantee you I could teach you how to punch pretty easy. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7759.780000000001s)]
*  You'd figure it out. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7761.820000000001s)]
*  It's amazing, I think I'm tough, [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7763.42s)]
*  like if some guy talks shit, [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7764.86s)]
*  but when I hit mitts, I really don't know what I'm doing. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7766.38s)]
*  But if some guy was like, and you go, I'll fuck you up, [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7769.299999999999s)]
*  and you went like this. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7772.0199999999995s)]
*  Fuckin' do your hair first. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7773.139999999999s)]
*  The key is to learn how to do it [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7775.58s)]
*  where you're not trying to hit something hard. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7777.139999999999s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7778.78s)]
*  Everybody tries hard, and when you try hard, [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7779.62s)]
*  you like, grr, and you grunt, [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7781.299999999999s)]
*  and you use all these muscles, [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7782.94s)]
*  and you fuck up your thing. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7784.099999999999s)]
*  When you learn how to punch correctly, [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7785.74s)]
*  the right way for someone to teach you [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7788.099999999999s)]
*  is literally to teach you just, [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7790.02s)]
*  you're not even doing it hard. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7792.5s)]
*  You're just learning how to move your body correctly, [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7794.9400000000005s)]
*  and then it becomes muscle memory. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7797.700000000001s)]
*  And then it becomes ingrained in your pathway, [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7799.42s)]
*  so you know where you're putting your foot. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7801.740000000001s)]
*  And then once you actually start hitting something hard, [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7803.38s)]
*  then your body knows what the motions are. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7806.42s)]
*  The problem is when you strain, [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7809.22s)]
*  you see big guys do that, big strong guys, [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7811.46s)]
*  they know they can hit hard, so they try to hit hard, [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7814.18s)]
*  so they grunt, and they stretch everything out. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7816.580000000001s)]
*  But that's the wrong way to do it. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7818.820000000001s)]
*  You're also gassed in like 20 seconds. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7820.22s)]
*  Yeah, because you're using so much muscle. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7821.22s)]
*  Sure. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7823.58s)]
*  You want to use technique, [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7824.42s)]
*  and you can learn how to do it slowly and softly. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7825.54s)]
*  It's just teaching yourself to not try to hit it hard. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7829.74s)]
*  You see those pros are so loose, too. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7832.139999999999s)]
*  They're just like, their shoulders just kinda pop. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7834.139999999999s)]
*  Same thing with Jiu Jitsu, too. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7836.099999999999s)]
*  The way to really learn Jiu Jitsu is to drill. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7837.7s)]
*  You just learn how to do something in a drill, [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7839.98s)]
*  where you're not straining against a person, [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7841.9s)]
*  you're learning how to just train your body [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7843.86s)]
*  to go through the motions. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7845.94s)]
*  When I got the best I got at Jiu Jitsu, [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7847.46s)]
*  the biggest leap that I got was between blue belt [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7850.26s)]
*  and purple belt, because I was training with Eddie, [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7851.42s)]
*  and we were training almost four or five days a week. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7853.42s)]
*  And we would drill all the time. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7856.1s)]
*  I had mats in my garage, we'd go get high, [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7857.58s)]
*  and he would go over techniques, [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7860.06s)]
*  and Eddie is a fucking great instructor, too. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7861.58s)]
*  He really breaks it down so well. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7863.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he's so good at it. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7865.9400000000005s)]
*  So we can get it. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7867.58s)]
*  And even though he's a stoner, [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7868.46s)]
*  and he's this wild dude, he's very disciplined. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7870.34s)]
*  And he smokes weed. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7872.5s)]
*  A little bit. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7873.7s)]
*  I want to bind him one time to take him down at the store, [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7874.54s)]
*  just as a gag. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=7876.9400000000005s)]

*  No, no you don't. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8130.52s)]
*  Joe, they're ripping through this shirt right now. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8131.84s)]
*  Yeah, but you say things, [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8134.16s)]
*  you don't really mean it, right? [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8135.0s)]
*  Like, when you say things, you know they're not true. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8136.4400000000005s)]
*  I call him. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8139.360000000001s)]
*  He does mean it. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8140.2s)]
*  I kinda mean it. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8141.04s)]
*  And I kinda mean it, which means he means it. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8141.88s)]
*  But you say things you know aren't true. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8144.16s)]
*  Like, remember that one time [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8146.12s)]
*  you said he could do the splits? [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8146.96s)]
*  You really thought he could. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8148.44s)]
*  I thought I actually thought I might be able to pull one out. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8149.799999999999s)]
*  But more importantly, out of that whole, [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8151.96s)]
*  look at those fucking, that's fucking. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8154.2s)]
*  That looks pretty good. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8156.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8156.96s)]
*  If you look at me, if I take my shirt off [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8157.799999999999s)]
*  and just do like this, you go, yeah. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8159.28s)]
*  No, right there you look pretty good though. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8163.36s)]
*  But you gotta know that you can't do the splits. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8164.92s)]
*  Like, why'd you say that? [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8167.5599999999995s)]
*  Because I thought I could pull it out. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8169.08s)]
*  Same reason I said I could run a marathon with no training. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8170.48s)]
*  Yeah, but a marathon is like you can run five miles. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8172.5599999999995s)]
*  I've seen you run five miles. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8175.28s)]
*  So just keep going. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8176.679999999999s)]
*  The idea of doing the splits is crazy. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8178.5199999999995s)]
*  The best part of that story for me [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8180.16s)]
*  was when you did a split and then you looked at me [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8182.32s)]
*  and you said, have you ever done a split? [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8184.44s)]
*  I said no. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8185.5199999999995s)]
*  And then in your eyes you go, [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8186.4s)]
*  like you're almost trying to talk to [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8188.24s)]
*  an island of people you discovered. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8189.719999999999s)]
*  You go, what made you think you could do that? [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8191.919999999999s)]
*  And I go, I don't know. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8193.52s)]
*  And you went. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8194.76s)]
*  Why could you do it? [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8195.6s)]
*  You're like, but what, you've never done it. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8196.96s)]
*  And I said, yeah I know. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8198.039999999999s)]
*  And you go, and you were willing to hurt yourself? [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8199.08s)]
*  And I was like, yeah. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8201.24s)]
*  I was gonna see if I could do it. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8202.8s)]
*  I just thought I could do it. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8204.199999999999s)]
*  But it takes a long time to get that flexible. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8205.52s)]
*  That's not a normal human thing. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8208.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8210.48s)]
*  I just roll the dice. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8211.52s)]
*  I like that energy though. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8214.36s)]
*  That's the fucking being. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8215.4s)]
*  That's Cinderella story energy. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8217.0s)]
*  That's not a Cinderella story. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8218.4s)]
*  That's a torn hamstring story. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8219.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8221.08s)]
*  But I like when you go places [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8221.92s)]
*  and people underestimate you. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8224.32s)]
*  And I love my favorite part of Sober October [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8226.08s)]
*  is the subtle shit talk where you go, [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8228.76s)]
*  I will murder you. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8231.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8232.439999999999s)]
*  I said, I think I can do more pushups than you. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8233.279999999999s)]
*  And your reply was, I will kill you. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8235.56s)]
*  And I started giggling so hard. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8238.359999999999s)]
*  I'm in dinner with my family [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8241.32s)]
*  and they're like, what are you laughing at? [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8243.0s)]
*  And I go, Joe. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8243.839999999998s)]
*  And they go, what did he say that's funny? [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8244.759999999998s)]
*  I go, was only funny if you know him intimately. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8246.119999999999s)]
*  Then you get, because I know you. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8249.48s)]
*  You're like, what the fuck? [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8250.759999999998s)]
*  And then I thought, I really thought, [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8252.439999999999s)]
*  because I've been to Ways to Wellness with you. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8254.279999999999s)]
*  Is it Ways to Wellness? [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8256.0s)]
*  Ways to Well. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8256.839999999998s)]
*  Ways to Well with you so many times. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8257.679999999998s)]

*  And I go, I bet he can't do a pushup. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8261.88s)]
*  I bet he can't do a pushup because of his shoulders. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8262.88s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8264.76s)]
*  But they're not that bad. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8265.6s)]
*  You unlock in Joe a competitiveness [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8266.8s)]
*  that only comes out around you. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8269.36s)]
*  What he did at your studio, [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8273.36s)]
*  whatever it's called. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8276.84s)]
*  Arm wrestle. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8277.68s)]
*  But just the way he was like, let's do it, fine. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8278.88s)]
*  It wasn't that competitive, but it was still like, [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8280.68s)]
*  he was like, bye, and then just walks out. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8282.72s)]
*  Crushes through, then walks out. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8285.08s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8291.52s)]

*  And then literally got up there [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8371.640000000001s)]
*  and one hopping off the fence. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8374.16s)]
*  And Attelle's like, are you fucking serious? [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8376.240000000002s)]
*  And then the pitcher goes, looks at the team, [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8378.56s)]
*  he goes, these are with no pace. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8381.039999999999s)]
*  There's no pace on these balls. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8382.52s)]
*  What does that mean, pace? [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8383.52s)]
*  Meaning he's throwing them at like 40 miles an hour. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8384.36s)]
*  So I'm doing all the work to get the ball out there. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8386.48s)]
*  He goes, with a little bit of pace, [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8389.8s)]
*  I think it'll go yard. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8391.24s)]
*  And I was like, put some pace on it. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8392.6s)]
*  And fucking, you can find the video [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8394.8s)]
*  of me hitting fucking bombs. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8397.16s)]
*  I think you are a secret athlete. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8399.44s)]
*  I really do. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8401.6s)]
*  I just think you just don't do anything about it. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8402.44s)]
*  You also have a specific athleticism. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8404.4s)]
*  I have things I'm good at. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8406.16s)]
*  I have a few things that I'm good at. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8408.7s)]
*  When I first heard you were a good athlete, [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8409.54s)]
*  or you told me that, I was like, the fuck out of here. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8412.18s)]
*  Because it's all based on what you know now. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8413.900000000001s)]
*  Well, what your origin is of athleticism. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8418.140000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8421.02s)]
*  So like a baseball, kid who played a lot of baseball [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8421.86s)]
*  thinks of somebody good at baseball. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8423.86s)]
*  So if you played football, that's all I did. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8426.34s)]
*  Great athlete means runs the fastest, jumps the highest, [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8429.42s)]
*  can bench fucking 225, 30 times. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8432.78s)]
*  I was like, no you don't. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8435.42s)]
*  But then I saw him do all the things that are, [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8436.380000000001s)]
*  it's still athletic. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8439.06s)]
*  It's just outside of that realm. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8439.98s)]
*  It's like everything that was hand-eye, [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8441.98s)]
*  golf ball, everything. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8444.54s)]
*  He could like, I'll throw this ball [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8445.98s)]
*  and hit that thing off that bar over there. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8447.78s)]
*  I'm like, what are you talking about? [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8451.460000000001s)]
*  And then he'd have boom, and like ding it. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8452.3s)]
*  I was like, oh shit. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8453.98s)]
*  He can make these wild claims on. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8455.1s)]
*  Maybe that's where the delusional part works. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8457.66s)]
*  Because you don't have any, you really believe it. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8460.98s)]
*  That's the thing he does. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8463.94s)]
*  Cause he's a real dreamer too. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8466.5s)]
*  He'll say, he really is. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8468.18s)]
*  He'll say. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8469.380000000001s)]
*  It's the way I tell a story. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8470.220000000001s)]
*  I live in a world where I want you to feel it. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8471.060000000001s)]
*  It's not about reality, it's about feeling it. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8474.300000000001s)]
*  I want everyone to, it's why I like alcohol. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8476.86s)]
*  I like the feelings. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8478.7s)]
*  I don't need it to be real. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8480.74s)]
*  I need you to, I want the energy. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8483.460000000001s)]
*  That's why I love a cigar and coffee is like, [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8486.54s)]
*  that's not how you're supposed to start a day, [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8488.7s)]
*  but that fa fa fa fa. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8489.86s)]
*  And I think I am that way with physical achievements. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8491.7s)]
*  My friends I grew up with, I mean, I've said this. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8494.02s)]
*  They look at me sometimes a little bummed out. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8497.86s)]
*  They'll be like, what happened to your body, man? [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8500.34s)]
*  You're like a legit athlete. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8501.78s)]
*  This isn't who you are. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8503.5s)]
*  But when I went to college, I remember, [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8504.82s)]
*  I remember Intermural Softball. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8507.34s)]
*  Everyone was making big claims about how good they were. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8509.34s)]
*  And I was like, I'm actually really good. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8511.66s)]
*  And I was like, I'm not gonna say a fucking word. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8514.1s)]
*  I'm not gonna say a word. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8515.82s)]
*  Everyone thinks I'm some stoner alcoholic. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8517.1s)]
*  I'm just gonna go in and just fucking drop bombs. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8519.42s)]
*  And then that look on someone's face [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8521.86s)]
*  when they expect nothing of you and you over deliver [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8524.62s)]
*  is I think how I've set up my career. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8527.94s)]
*  Same with stand up. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8530.1s)]
*  I remember I ripping my shirt off [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8531.34s)]
*  and I remember David Letterman [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8533.34s)]
*  was doing an interview with Mike Binder. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8536.140000000001s)]
*  And Binder texted it to me and David Letterman goes, [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8538.66s)]
*  I mean, he rips his shirt off. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8542.140000000001s)]
*  Like, you don't expect anything. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8543.300000000001s)]
*  And then it's good material. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8545.7s)]
*  And then I was, I got that, I was crying. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8548.02s)]
*  I was like, that's everything I want you to do [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8550.5s)]
*  is like under believe and then over achieve. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8552.859999999999s)]
*  And but I think with, but I think especially with sports, [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8555.14s)]
*  I have a little bit of, I live in maybe not a big reality. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8561.46s)]
*  I'm like that with fucking. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8565.939999999999s)]
*  Really? [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8567.46s)]
*  I can't fuck at all. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8568.3s)]
*  I'm very real about fucking. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8569.14s)]
*  I can't fuck at all. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8569.98s)]
*  I feel bad for the end sometimes. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8571.859999999999s)]
*  Even she talks about it. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8575.66s)]
*  Can you imagine this mounting you and just pumping you? [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8579.38s)]
*  She's probably so worried you're gonna die on her. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8582.38s)]
*  No, I've come so fast that she's laughed. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8585.699999999999s)]

*  She goes, well, it's just, I mean, come on. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8593.14s)]
*  That was. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8595.14s)]
*  You would have to see the humor in this. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8596.58s)]
*  Like she goes, I don't think you could have gotten AIDS [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8598.3s)]
*  from that fuck. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8600.019999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8619.92s)]
*  You get worked up ahead of time. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8620.76s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8621.6s)]

*  Wee. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8624.52s)]
*  I could grind on the bed while I go down on her [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8625.36s)]
*  and fucking cum in the sheets. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8626.68s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8639.24s)]
*  It's probably why I don't cheat [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8640.08s)]
*  because I think if I fuck someone, [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8640.92s)]
*  the look of disappointment in their face, fear. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=8641.800000000001s)]

*  in the fan experience as an artist [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9327.32s)]

*  He's the problem. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9431.4s)]
*  Because he's already doing the biggest venues you can do. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9432.48s)]
*  Right, but he'll be done around the time [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9435.0s)]

*  We could do June or later. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9446.28s)]
*  June or later is good. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9447.76s)]

*  or 30th anniversary of Dark Side of the Moon. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9500.56s)]

*  Oh, he takes his shit very, very seriously. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9512.36s)]

*  Oh, we talked about that a lot yesterday. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9522.08s)]

*  Not necessarily. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9527.68s)]

*  why they're reacting this way. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9530.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9531.84s)]

*  to join NATO. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9547.08s)]

*  I mean, it's not to excuse what Putin did. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9550.16s)]
*  Putin did something absolutely horrific, [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9552.4s)]
*  but it's not like he wasn't provoked. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9554.2s)]
*  Well, sure. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9556.2s)]
*  He was provoked. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9557.039999999999s)]
*  And it's not like there aren't people [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9557.88s)]

*  We're fucking sitting here because. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9564.56s)]
*  When was it completed? [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9565.4s)]
*  How long ago? [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9566.24s)]
*  Like a year ago? [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9567.08s)]
*  Probably a year ago. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9567.92s)]
*  That is so wild that you can't release it [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9568.76s)]
*  because it's kind of pro-Russia. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9571.16s)]
*  I think you were done over a year ago. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9573.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9574.32s)]

*  It's probably smart. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9582.4s)]
*  You're probably not the expert on that. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9583.68s)]
*  I was like, wait, are we not pro-Russia? [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9584.52s)]
*  And they're like, no, okay, good call, good call. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=9586.48s)]

*  when he died because I had an opportunity [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10493.28s)]
*  to see him one night at the store [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10494.720000000001s)]
*  and I decided to go do something else. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10495.84s)]
*  I remember someone said, Mooney's gonna do a set [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10497.68s)]
*  at the store and I hadn't seen him in years [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10499.52s)]

*  Yeah, but I still wish I said hi and gave him a hug. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10508.68s)]
*  It always is. [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10512.24s)]
*  It's just like he was, whatever the disease was, [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10513.2s)]
*  it wasn't, he still had some killer bits, [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10516.560000000001s)]
*  but it made you sad. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10519.08s)]

*  worked the city landscape into his bit. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10736.279999999999s)]
*  Dude, he did sit stuff that weekend. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10738.439999999999s)]
*  I still haven't seen people do. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10740.16s)]
*  Which is like, we were doing like six show weekends [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10741.92s)]
*  at Brea. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10744.039999999999s)]
*  And Thursday, he would do, you know, his set. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10745.24s)]
*  And there'd be like this joke, whatever, [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10748.88s)]
*  20 minutes in that kills. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10750.92s)]
*  And then Friday early show, [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10753.279999999999s)]
*  there'd be a different punchline that would do worse. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10755.84s)]
*  So Friday late show, I would listen, [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10759.519999999999s)]
*  and it would be that joke again. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10762.52s)]
*  He would do, he didn't do the Thursday night one [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10763.92s)]
*  that killed, he tried yet another. [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10766.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and I was like, what the fuck? [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10768.119999999999s)]
*  And he was doing this like throughout his set [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10769.72s)]
*  all the time. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10771.76s)]
*  It was like, he was never satisfied, [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10772.6s)]
*  even if it was doing well. [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10775.08s)]
*  I was like, he's just always tweaking [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10776.52s)]
*  and then he was recording them. [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10778.279999999999s)]
*  Exact words. [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10779.52s)]
*  Like I'd never seen somebody [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10780.84s)]
*  he just doesn't self promote at all. [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10782.64s)]
*  No, no. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10785.039999999999s)]
*  Which is, yeah. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10785.88s)]
*  He also has a joke structure [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10786.8s)]
*  that's different than everybody. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10787.84s)]
*  Where we'll do, tag, tag, tag, right? [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10789.279999999999s)]
*  And then the next level is tag, tag, up, up, [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10792.32s)]
*  like change the game on the third tag. [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10795.84s)]
*  He does tag, change the game slightly, [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10798.24s)]
*  and then go ridiculous on the third. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10800.84s)]
*  In a way that you gotta get the audience [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10802.64s)]
*  along with you for that. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10804.439999999999s)]
*  He does it. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10805.4s)]
*  Sure, yeah. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10806.24s)]
*  He was a master. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10807.359999999999s)]
*  He was having standing ovations everywhere. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10808.519999999999s)]
*  And he's one of those guys that quit drinking [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10810.72s)]
*  and actually got better. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10812.359999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10813.279999999999s)]
*  Everyone quits drinking gets better. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10814.359999999999s)]
*  You too? [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10816.0s)]
*  I'm such a better comic writer when I don't drink. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10816.84s)]
*  I don't drink on stage, [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10819.679999999998s)]
*  but the laziness of the drinking in between, [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10820.52s)]
*  lack of motivation, lack of looking at my sets, [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10823.800000000001s)]
*  lack of focus. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10826.2s)]
*  Or time. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10827.28s)]
*  Yeah, it just shows up and it rears its head. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10828.12s)]
*  I think it's fun to get drunk on stage every now and then [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10830.48s)]
*  and fuck your act up and try to figure it out in the moment [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10832.4s)]
*  or get high and do that. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10835.08s)]
*  But for the most part, I have to do stand-ups over. [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10836.560000000001s)]
*  I have to be dialed in. [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10838.36s)]
*  You gotta, yeah, those weaknesses. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10840.12s)]
*  I was going back from Jackson, getting ready for my special, [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10842.800000000001s)]
*  and I was like, I'll get high in the road home with Adrian. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10844.68s)]
*  And then I was like, no, I know what else [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10847.6s)]
*  is gonna happen if I get high. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10848.800000000001s)]
*  I'll go home and watch TV. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10850.64s)]
*  And if I don't get high, [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10852.2s)]
*  I'll go work on some of those taglines. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10853.039999999999s)]
*  That's the opposite with me. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10855.4s)]
*  When I get home from a gig, [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10856.96s)]
*  I spark up a joint and sit in front of the computer. [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10858.12s)]
*  Really? [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10860.68s)]
*  Yeah, man, that's my favorite time to write. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10861.52s)]
*  Like right after I get off stage, [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10862.8s)]
*  because I'm fresh, I've just got off stage [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10865.64s)]
*  and I have these ideas in my head [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10867.36s)]
*  and everyone's asleep in my house. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10868.68s)]
*  So I just fucking open up the patio door, spark one up, [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10870.8s)]
*  and I get nervous and crazy and fucking paranoid. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10873.84s)]
*  And then I run up in front of the computer [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10877.16s)]
*  and start writing. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10878.8s)]
*  That's a good habit. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10880.16s)]
*  You have a different motivation than other people. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10881.0s)]
*  You probably go on stage as a millionaire [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10883.24s)]
*  more than any millionaire in the world. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10887.119999999999s)]
*  Yep, yep. [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10888.84s)]
*  There's not a lot of millionaires doing what you do. [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10889.68s)]
*  You gotta work out, man. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10892.279999999999s)]
*  You gotta do what got you to the dance. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10893.72s)]
*  I never stop. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10896.48s)]
*  You have to. [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10898.119999999999s)]
*  You gotta do clubs. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10899.039999999999s)]
*  I do little shitty shows. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10900.68s)]
*  I do everything. [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10902.359999999999s)]
*  When I landed, I texted, I was like, I'm going to bed. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10903.199999999999s)]
*  And then you were like, do a spot. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10905.32s)]
*  And I was like, I cannot do a spot. [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10906.359999999999s)]
*  I can write it off and go. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10909.199999999999s)]
*  We shamed you. [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10910.199999999999s)]
*  We shamed you into coming. [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10911.039999999999s)]
*  I was texting with you and I was talking to Ari. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10912.64s)]
*  I was like, fuck, Bert's going to sleep. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10914.96s)]
*  No way, fuck that. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10917.0s)]
*  Emily will shame me. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10918.92s)]
*  She'll be like, hey, I won't call him for my avails [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10919.88s)]
*  at the store if I'm home. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10922.92s)]
*  And she'll just be like, we have availability on Tuesday. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10923.96s)]
*  And then as soon as I get there, I go, I have to do it. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10926.88s)]
*  I have to do it. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10928.64s)]
*  It's like, you gotta put in the work, man. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10930.84s)]
*  It's like, there's no substitute for stage time. [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10932.88s)]
*  There's no substitute for sets. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10935.119999999999s)]
*  When you get in shape, [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10937.119999999999s)]
*  one of the things that I realized when I do a long tour, [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10938.080000000002s)]
*  I really realized that for the first time [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10941.04s)]
*  when I did the Charlie Murphy tour, [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10942.76s)]
*  because we did 22 dates in a month. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10943.92s)]
*  So we were constantly on the road. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10947.080000000002s)]
*  And God damn, and I was talking to Red Band about this. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10948.84s)]
*  He's like, dude, there's something that happened to you. [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10951.28s)]
*  Like around the 10th show, you just got into this zone [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10953.44s)]
*  where you just, and you're in that right now [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10957.080000000002s)]
*  because you're killing it. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10958.640000000001s)]
*  We did like 24 shows last month, something like that. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10959.480000000001s)]
*  You just know, now you're just like, you know it. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10962.560000000001s)]
*  Oh, I can do shit. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10965.160000000002s)]
*  There's no substitute for that. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10966.0s)]
*  I can do shit with this set right now. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10966.84s)]
*  I can rearrange the whole order [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10968.52s)]
*  and then play the game in my head [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10970.2s)]
*  of figuring out what I haven't done yet. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10972.12s)]
*  But like, thinking on the fly [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10974.12s)]
*  while you're killing with the big going, [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10975.6s)]
*  what should I do next? [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30-827tF_Nk&t=10976.92s)]
