# Joe Rogan Experience #1463 - Tom Green
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqONHtFiHQ)
*  One the og ladies and gentlemen. Oh Joe you're the og dude. We can give each other real knuckles
*  I'm not i'm not like i'm not crazy. I'm not
*  I'm not like a paranoid person, but i'll tell you joe
*  You got me to leave my house for the first time in five weeks
*  I'm so happy you left and i'm so happy you got tested
*  Yeah
*  The first time in five weeks that i've left the house and yeah, I got tested and i'm and everything's great
*  So but i'm not like, you know paranoid or anything like that. So spray it down, baby
*  How how bad is all this lysol for us stuff is pretty good. This is a real question, right?
*  How bad is all this lysol? Yeah, it'll be fine. Yeah aerosol's probably not bad
*  Um, but no great to be here. Thank you my pleasure me and uh, man what?
*  I haven't I haven't left my house in five weeks
*  Uh, i've been isolating
*  as a responsible citizen, right? Yes. Yeah, and uh
*  I feel good. I feel first of all i'm excited to be here. I uh, i'm excited to have you here
*  I posted that i've been going through my computers. I'm at home. I'm going through my computers and just
*  Kill in time. I live alone. Okay, I happen to be single
*  At this point in my life ladies
*  There you go, huh? Right?
*  Right before this happened, uh, and I kind of think to myself sometimes I think okay
*  imagine if I had been in a
*  Relationship that hadn't been going well and this happened and then you have to make the decision to isolate with somebody
*  I'm not in that situation. I'm home alone
*  and
*  I've been talking a lot to my friends on facetime and i've been socializing and i've been
*  you know
*  Living life in this world, but alone in my house. I'm going through my computers
*  Started going through old footage. I found that clip
*  from when you came up to my house back in the day and uh
*  Yeah, I just I I saw this moment where
*  I just i'll jump right into this if that's cool
*  Sure, because this I saw this moment in the clip where we started talking about my old web show and you'd come up
*  To my house back in the day and it was so cool that you came up then and I remember at the time
*  Your website was like way advanced, right?
*  Like it had all sorts of extra stuff on it that people weren't really doing on the web back then and you came up
*  We just started talking about the web
*  And um, that was because of my webmaster andrew blevin shout out to andrew. Uh, he's a wizard at web creating
*  So I was always really into web stuff, you know, I had my website
*  I started my website early when I was you know up in canada and I was really
*  Thought that was cool and we started talking about what I was doing which was kind of crazy, right?
*  And then you just started talking about
*  You said you said uh
*  What what we got to do is figure out how we're going to make some money off this and i'm like, yeah
*  And i'm like i'm going yeah, I don't know. I mean, you know, i'd been trying I had been trying i'd been going to
*  You know advertisers and saying they were like what?
*  You know, what what do you mean the internet, you know, but uh, it's kind of funny
*  I saw that clip. I thought that's hilarious because you know
*  Not to not to you know blow too much smoke up your ass
*  But clearly you figured out how to make money off of it and it was hilarious
*  I'm like that's hilarious and prophetic moment. How can we make money off of it? Now? We're here in this beautiful studio
*  there was a few moments that uh
*  Really planted a seed in my head to do something like this online this yours was a big one
*  Yeah being at your house and seeing how you had servers you had full cables like folks
*  This room is not as sophisticated as tom green's home was in 2007. That's how crazy it was
*  There was some weird stuff in there
*  Yeah, but you had it set up like and you had a whole internet service provider set up at your house
*  Like like you could have run like a network in 2007 you had all those you had that whole rack
*  With all that equipment I walked into that room and it's humming and i'm like, holy shit, dude
*  It was the g-ray drive. Yeah, the g-ray drives. Yeah, I was like, this is crazy. This is your house
*  And like folks like back then you had to have these cables that snake through the house
*  Like so everything was taped down. I was like fuck dude
*  This is like you you literally turned your house into a set
*  Like it was much more like a set than anything i'd ever seen before outside of a set
*  It was light screwed into the ceiling. Yeah, I kind of trashed my place
*  You even figured out how to take video calls from people. That was exciting. That was exciting. I had this this
*  Yeah, there it is tom green. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and then the tv on the wall. Yeah, and there's my dog steve
*  Oh poor steve. Oh and look I have uh, don't have gray in my beard. Oh look at that. Um, yeah
*  Young man back this was probably around 2007. I guess yeah
*  And that's that was the back corner of my living room there
*  It's a genius and you can see all the wires going up see that that's going up into the ceiling
*  Up through the ceiling into the spare room, which I turned into the editing room
*  Look how crazy all this equipment is dude. You were so ahead of everybody. That's actually a little later actually
*  I'm looking at this now. This is later. This is after uh, because I can tell because that's an actual
*  That's not the tricaster. That's an actual television switcher. I forget what model it's a sony switcher
*  So you started with a tricaster and a there was a thing called a video toaster system first
*  I had that for a year then we got this the first version of the tricaster
*  That's victor who was working on the show and he's he's stoked that i'm here today
*  I still talk to victor quite a bit shout out to victor victor. What's up, but um,
*  So yeah, so that was a little later. Um
*  But uh still kind of uh, you know, we're talking three years later. So 2010 ish. Yeah. Yeah
*  Look at all your like your lighting and everything like you had done it where you had basically instead of like putting cameras in your house
*  You would turn your house into a studio. It was like legit
*  I remember thinking oh my god, because anthony cumia had a kind of a pretty high-tech
*  Set up in his basement. Yeah, that was another inspiration. Yeah, yeah
*  Because he was doing that while he was doing opi and anthony and you know, they actually
*  His employers at the time wanted him to stop doing it. They had decided somehow or another
*  It's not he shouldn't be allowed to do an extra show, right? He's like, but i'm just promoting the serious show
*  Right, like this is free like people can see it. It's fun. So anthony would uh do karaoke with machine guns in front of green screen
*  He's still she's still kicking ass on the internet. Yeah. Yes. Wait. Well now he has his own he has his own network
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love that guy. He's a he's a unique dude and he was great on opi and anthony
*  He was always really funny and just like like a comic but he never did stand-up. Yeah, it's really interesting
*  He's like the most comicky comic guy that i've ever met that never did stand-up is anthony cumia
*  100 could have been a great comic 100
*  I think sometimes people that
*  I mean, i'm just making this up right now
*  But I think sometimes people that have never done stand-up who do radio are afraid of it, you know
*  Because it's like the maybe you know because they can they can it's a scary thing getting on stage
*  You know in front of an audience if you've never done it before but you get comfortable behind that mic, but anyways
*  Yeah, man
*  It was so cool when you came up because I remember like I think there was like entertainment tonight was there that day or something
*  Like that remember that and you talked to them after that's right. And you left this made this quote to them
*  and that went out and it was
*  Defining what's happened in our world you were just saying, you know, like we don't need the advertisers anymore
*  We don't we don't need the networks anymore. We don't you know, we can get go straight to the advertiser
*  I always is that video available anywhere? I think I saw it on the internet
*  So that that video of me saying that is kind of hilarious if you stop and think about how all this internet stuff has played out
*  Since then it's like street and there was this pre youtube, right?
*  Like nobody was uploading to youtube you had to have your own tomgreen.com setup. So I remember I got a call
*  This is one of those like, you know when you think about think back and you sort of kick yourself. I'm
*  You know, I was it was so
*  I mean how far into the weeds do we want to get technically I was
*  It's like people are like who give a fuck. Oh, there it is right there. But here I was I I had the sir
*  That's the clip. Yeah, that's my backwards basketball baseball hat days. So we were still in those days
*  We were hosting the stuff on this site called bit gravity.com
*  So we would upload our shit to that were those the guys from denver?
*  Uh, no, uh bit gravity is san francisco. Okay, san francisco and barrett lion is
*  Did you do some stuff with some guys from denver that was that was
*  Sort of around the same time they were that was mania tv. Yeah, right, right
*  And so they kind of but what I what what I did?
*  Was mania tv was
*  The only people that were really doing live streaming and I said hey, you know
*  Like I want to build this tv studio and they helped me build the studio
*  But I I wanted it. I wanted to be autonomous of them as well. So I got my own servers
*  Through this company bit gravity where they basically
*  Invented the technology to upload video and then serve it out. Right? So I would link that to my website tomgreen.com
*  Completely autonomous of the other website mania tv
*  so
*  You know, it was some this funny shit that happened there because you know, I remember
*  Like I think back ago. I really made a few mistakes
*  You know like I go I want all the stuff to be on my website, right and then youtube started
*  Now, what's this? Oh youtube. Oh, that's cool. They're doing a thing out of an apartment in san francisco
*  I remember at one point somebody called me from youtube and said hey man
*  We really like what you're doing with your thing. I'm like, oh, that's cool. Cool, man. Yeah. Yeah
*  I'm kind of doing my own thing over here. You know, yeah, that's cool
*  I like what you're doing too and never really kind of connected with them because I thought I was thinking at the time
*  It's got to all be on your server right till you have those views not thinking okay
*  We could have it out spread it send it out just get the eyeballs on it
*  So but it was it was exciting. It was exciting time. Everybody thought that though
*  I mean no one could have ever saw what youtube had been. Yeah, or has become yeah
*  It's great what's crazy about youtube is that there's not another one. It's just youtube
*  It's like there's vimeo and a few other
*  Fairly popular video sites, but it's like the xfl compared to the nfl or something like that
*  Not even the xfl is done, right? Did they just go under? Yeah done
*  Now it's like comparing the two of them because all those other video things it's like yeah, you'll get some views
*  But it's just youtube for whatever reason captured they they have the market. It never became my space
*  You know, imagine well remember youtube. Yeah, something as simple as uploading video
*  Yeah, I mean obviously it's complex right like just the being able to get it onto the website and make sure it streams and all
*  The technical stuff super complex, but just the concept is pretty simple you with your phone
*  Or video camera you film it you can upload it like real simple anybody can do it
*  And then anybody all of a sudden get views like that is amazing that one company has that locked up
*  It's kind of crazy because you would think that like boy
*  That would be something that everybody would want to get involved in look how much money youtube is making
*  Yeah, I would I would
*  I haven't thought about that, but I guess kind of not the amount of
*  of
*  Advancement that happens every
*  Six months in in technology and they've got the funding to be able to stay right on top of it and just make it the strongest
*  Platform possibly I don't know. I don't even twitter like how they do that. There's like one twitter
*  Yeah, I mean there's facebook and I guess people hold discussions on instagram
*  But if I read one of the things that drives me crazy about instagram
*  It's like if I go to your page and i'm reading one of your uh captions someone will say something in response to someone
*  They're like hey fuck you dick boy or whatever and then I try to click and find out what they were talking about
*  And I get to the beginning of the comments and then I gotta go through all the comments to try to figure this out
*  Like why can't I just click? So do you do that you get into the comments you're you're on other people's shit
*  Okay, not your own though. No
*  It seems like fun
*  You gotta leave people to talk about you like just go ahead
*  Yeah, if you really get into it and start reading it's like good and bad. Yeah, both of them are equally toxic
*  That's pretty good. You believe the the bad you like. Oh my god. This guy hates me so much. It's a pretty good
*  Uh, you know form of restraint though to not be curious and to go read. Oh, well, you're always curious
*  The key is just not giving into it
*  It's just listen there's a lot of time in a day, but not if you spend it doing stupid shit
*  Yeah, you those things are not beneficial. Most of them are a waste. Yeah, like most of like the
*  Reading comments or get getting into it with people
*  That's the big one when you see people like arguing with fans and going back and forth like that is
*  That is a trap. You're only going to respond to the negative ones
*  You know if you're responding to the positive ones and the negative ones
*  People trying to get your attention some of them don't even mean what they're saying
*  They're just 15 year old kids that want to rile you up. It's like is that a way to talk to people?
*  The way to talk to people is like this. Hi, what's up? We're in front of each other
*  That's how people talk when they're just being around people. This is how we're supposed to talk
*  Yeah, all this other shit is too confusing for us. Oh, yeah, we don't know how to handle it
*  Yeah, and i've i've fallen into that trap for sure. I've gone through
*  cycles of the way I handle comments
*  I've become an indiscriminate blocker with what I do now the first sign of negativity. It's a
*  And I know I have some people say oh, that's not very democratic
*  But what I whatever the way I look at it is you create an environment
*  Yeah, i'm trying to create a positive environment on my social media and but the problem is and what you're saying is making me
*  Second guess myself to be honest with you because I know I spend far too much time on that shit
*  and i'm thinking
*  Man, I really should just not read that stuff time's precious. Yeah, it's precious even now when people are forced to not work
*  You can do one of two things, right? You could either drink all day, which a lot of people are doing
*  There's a hilarious video of this guy who's out jogging in his neighborhood
*  Just passed by people's recyclables pointing out all the empty wine bottles and empty vodka bottles
*  And he just jogs over. Let's see what this guy's got. Boom. Same shit whiskey wine
*  Bam bam, bam people are just getting lit up you could do that or you could use this time to get in shape
*  You could use this time to write out a workout program. You could use this time to start reading books online
*  You know you could you don't even have to leave your house. We have a kindle just uh, or you know
*  Or one of those barnes no is barnes and noble the nook. Is that still around are barnes and noble still real?
*  They haven't gone under they have bookstores. They still have books. I think they have bookstores. They still have books
*  They do have bookstores. I've been doing before
*  I've been doing recently now. That's the thing after this that's really gonna that kind of that kind of old media, you know
*  Tangible media that's really gonna because people are getting losing their old habits now, you know
*  You know, it's true can't go to a bookstore now you
*  Sure kindle and all these things are taken and bookstores were hurting already because of amazon because you just order it online
*  Like if I want a book, it's there tomorrow
*  You know, there's something about that like not having to leave and now the people getting used to getting groceries delivered
*  If you live in a neighborhood that has a grocery store that delivers you can just order online
*  They'll send it to your house. So i've i've
*  Like I said, I haven't left my house in five weeks
*  It's first time I left it's like a castaway type deal or like a prisoner with an ankle bracelet joe joe rogan calls
*  You come okay, but no one else would have gotten me out of my house. Really? Yeah, absolutely. Oh nobody else
*  Uh, but I was I was very uh, you know, i'm honored to be here. I love the show
*  But uh, no listen, I uh, I have gotten good at living, uh in my house without
*  leaving, um, I uh, first of all one thing that was weird and I actually
*  Find it strange actually I find this strange
*  About four weeks before shit went down, right?
*  For whatever reason it was happening. It was it was in like it was in italy. I think it was bad over there. I
*  I'm not by any means, uh doomsday prepper or anything like that. You know, in fact, i'm the opposite
*  I've always said to myself if something went wrong
*  You know, i'd have like I don't I'd have like one day's supply of food or something like that in my house and I went
*  before the rush on the toilet paper all that stuff
*  I went and I got
*  Non-perishable food. I got sardines. I read articles about what's good protein. I got you know beans. I got rice. I got
*  Stuck up my pantry with stuff. I got about a month's supply of food not thinking
*  That I was actually
*  going to
*  Actually, I mean I knew it was possible there were glimmers of it
*  They were starting to talk about it, but not thinking I was actually going to be
*  locked in my house
*  And then all of a sudden it happened and you just were being smart
*  You're like wouldn't it be nice if I did have a month's supply of food?
*  Yeah
*  I talk about this stuff a lot with my friends and we're always sort of talking about the possibilities of things
*  But you know, you didn't think it was actually gonna happen. So then it happened. So
*  Uh, then I've discovered some delivery services that deliver groceries
*  Right, but who are the people delivering it and are they healthy? So so here's the thing
*  So yeah, I do not interact with them. Oh Jesus
*  But you touched the stuff that they touched right? Um, well, you know, I mean again again again
*  Just just to be safe
*  I I did disinfect them and then I take them and I put them in with gloves with rubber gloves and put them into a
*  A another room and I let it sit for three days for the virus to die
*  And then uh, then I start eating then I start eating I wish there was a clear answer
*  To all this. Mm-hmm. I wish there was a clear solution to all this
*  I tell you
*  Talking to you is making me feel
*  Better. Well, I feel better reading the latest statistics
*  About the mortality rate. I wonder what the actual there's a an infection rate hospitalization rate mortality rate
*  And what was it was the study that was was it ucla? Is that what it was?
*  For sure
*  And it showed a very low fatality rate in comparison to infection. So
*  That's good news
*  But the the bad news is this you know
*  It could still kill a lot of fucking people and people that are immune compromised people with diabetes people that are overweight people with lung problems people with
*  Cigarette habits all those and particularly one of the nurses was saying people who were into the jewel people who smoke
*  With jewel they said there's a high instance that they're that he personally was seeing of people
*  Was it the he nurse or the she nurse?
*  hmm
*  I'm, I'm telling me this
*  Know what? I was wondering, you know, remember like it's like one month before this happened. There people were having lung issues because of
*  vapes
*  And do you think that was coronavirus? Well, so it was a big thing like for like a week
*  We had that explained to us by maybe that was coronavirus we had that explained to us by adam curry
*  Yeah, it wasn't really what it appeared to be what it really was is a concerted effort to conflate
*  Two things that were happening one these assholes that made like really shitty low level thc vape pens
*  That got people sick and a couple people died. I forget how many people died
*  Was it like 10 people died jamie something like that adam curry told us the whole story in the podcast then
*  The cigarette companies
*  or whoever is behind this tried to
*  Get all tobacco vapes banned and they're trying to ban
*  I was fixing my shot because I want to be on the camera. I don't want the mic block block my face
*  But your extra hand sanitizer. I haven't that's the first thing i've touched in such ripping. I know I'm not thinking about
*  That's your girl's stuff by too much sanitizer, that's good
*  It's killing everything the good and the bad it's sanitizing but it's not good if you
*  I know a guy who uses this stuff all the time. He's getting warts all over his hands now because his uh,
*  His immune system's all fucked up. Oh, yeah sanitizing constant carlin bit. Yeah, well, that's really what happens
*  Like you're not supposed to use antibacterial soap. You need bacteria. Yeah, that's a great bit when we would uh in jujitsu
*  Sometimes guys would get uh staph infections or ringworm is a big one and ringworm they would use
*  antibacterial soap and it would wind up fucking up their whole body and they'd wind up getting it more often like they think
*  Oh, i'm just using antibacterial soap all the time
*  So you're killing all the healthy shit on your the outside of your skin
*  And then you wonder why you're getting sick all the time. You wonder why your skin is getting infected
*  i'm not like that normally but
*  Honestly is the first one of the actually that when you made me that coffee earlier
*  Whatever that coffee was which was amazing. That's the layered hamilton stuff
*  It's a black rifle coffee mixed with layered hamilton's turmeric
*  Uh, which is just uh, some hawaii surfer coffee. Yeah. Yeah, it was good. It was good. It's basically what curry is
*  Yeah, it's so good. Right? Oh my god, I know coconut milk. Oh, it's nice. Yeah good for you. Super healthy
*  That's the first thing that someone object that i've touched in over a month that someone else had touched
*  For sure. You've definitely touched other things you just forgot
*  Well, no one's been in my house, that's true you haven't left the house at all so no i've touched the groceries but I
*  disinfect them first disinfected but so it's but I I don't I don't expect to be
*  Like this forever. You know, well, that's the question. Like when do we go back? Did you see the mayor of las vegas?
*  Yeah with anderson cooper. This is not china. This is las vegas nevada
*  So there's a line that you know on this end of the spectrum it's complete
*  Casual lackadaisical approach to what's going on. There's this end of the spectrum, which is I guess me right now, right?
*  and then there's the middle which is more of
*  She on the
*  Far end we're gonna open up las vegas. We're gonna have casinos open
*  When are the casinos gonna open winners comedy's gonna start again? When are we gonna be back on the road telling jokes?
*  It's a good question, man. I my most
*  Everything I've had I think has been moved
*  There was supposed to be some stuff in may that I was doing in demoine, iowa
*  and um
*  Somewhere else and that that's getting moved and the only thing that I have scheduled is july in vegas
*  So i'm like, I don't know if that's real
*  Yeah, that seems so crazy to say that. I don't know here in april whether or not i'll be able to do a gig in july
*  in vegas
*  You have the podcast you're doing the podcast you get your
*  Adrenaline rush from that. I'm assuming you get an adrenaline rush from this you get it from stand-up
*  Of course, right?
*  Is it weird having an absence of that stand-up comedy thing not just because it's fun to do but just physically
*  Are you feeling different not getting that on stage?
*  Energy rush every night. No, I mean you go down there. Yes and no, but I know
*  I know I can't do anything about it. So I just shut it off
*  Right. I'm like i'm not gonna think about that
*  Yeah, you can't think about shit that there's nothing you can do about that'll just drive you mad
*  I heard you're talking about that with donnell. Yeah, he's got as you go. Okay, you can't stand up right now. That's just what it is
*  It is what it is
*  Look man, have you just stopped the thing about think about a guy that works at grocery store?
*  Okay, it's uh, not the worst job in the world, but it's fine
*  Now all of a sudden he's in a fucking war zone. He's in a viral war zone
*  He's got a hope that some coughing motherfucker doesn't give him a death sentence while he's uh restocking the rice
*  Right. It's a different world different world for them for me what I just I can't I can't go on stage for a while
*  Yeah, yeah, it's terrible. I feel bad for the comedy clubs
*  Really? I feel bad for the waitresses and the waiters
*  And uh the the kitchen staff and the managers and all the people that don't have a paycheck coming in
*  I feel bad for them
*  And i'm happy to do a ton of free shows when we come back
*  um
*  I'll just do do shows and donate all the money to the comedy store or the improv or whoever
*  Happy to help. Yeah, but um, I think that it is
*  In for us in particular, it's an inconvenient thing. Yeah, but it's not life-threatening
*  This is a life-threatening time for some people for nurses and hospital workers
*  It's a life-threatening time for that chicago bus driver. Did you see that video the bus driver?
*  Yeah, he's telling people please be courteous
*  Don't be confident in the middle of the pandemic and then he's dead a few days later. Yeah horrific, right? That's
*  This is see
*  This is why this disease is so fucked up. It just seems like for some people
*  It's a death sentence
*  And then for other people it's nothing and that just doesn't make any sense to me
*  Just i'm clearly i'm not a doctor and clearly this is a new virus
*  But it's just so weird that something could be asymptomatic for a huge amount of people
*  But some people get it and they barely even notice it. They just feel a little bit of fatigue
*  Some people get a little bit of a cough for a couple days and then nothing and other people are dead
*  Like it's nuts. It doesn't it doesn't compute in my head like other things, you know what i'm saying
*  Like so have you ever been seriously ill? Yes, i've had the flu
*  but I mean like
*  I i'm a cancer survivor, right? Right. So
*  to me
*  Not putting not saying the flu is not seriously ill that's flu die from the flu right die from the flu. We know this but
*  so
*  When I got cancer my show was on mtv things were going great. Everything was going great, you know
*  I got my show on mtv people were watching i'd been doing it on public access in canada for years six years
*  I've been working away making my own show because you know, I've known no one's ever gonna give me a freaking show
*  So i'll make my own show right sort of I did that before the web
*  I did that first right that's how I I always thought like that, you know, all of a sudden i'm on mtv. Everything's great. Oh, oh, um
*  Feeling a little funny down there
*  Fortunately, I went to the doctor right which a lot of young people who get testicular cancer
*  Thank you very much. What don't go to the doctor right away. So it spreads
*  And they die right? I went to the doctor. I was lucky. I went to the doctor but for me
*  Having that happen at that time was so
*  Bizarre just in the you know, I sometimes think if I'd gotten if I had gotten that
*  testicular cancer
*  one year earlier
*  You know mtv wouldn't have picked up the show yet
*  So I would have been in canada dealing with it and then probably they wouldn't have picked up the show and my life would be
*  completely different that sort of change the and sort of the the
*  the
*  You know, I don't believe there's coincidences. Sometimes I don't believe in coincidences. Sometimes I do I flip-flop on that but but
*  I I basically
*  Because of that what that sort of made me realize is that like
*  Life's random
*  It's not fair
*  Shit can happen
*  even if it
*  is unlikely
*  It might happen to me and because of that
*  Having dealt with that and it just sucked man. It sucked having cancer like like because it wasn't just about like
*  You know removing my right testicle, right? You know, that's that that sucks enough. You think that you know, but it's fine
*  I got the left one. It's fine. It's the middle one now. It's fine. It's doing good
*  But i'm doing a bit but no, but the thing is they also did the lymph node dissection. It cut me open
*  It was painful. I was in the hospital for eight six eight weeks or six weeks
*  Took took years to recover from that physically like pain
*  nerve damage just
*  you know
*  Slowing down your body and so I just go I don't want to go through that again. Like I just I'm
*  I'm happy to just stay in my house right now
*  Cut cut all you know cut cut, you know, just completely like
*  Improve my odds. I don't really have anything to do right now anyways, you know, I i'm not touring
*  I have a lot of stuff that I love doing in my house. I'm
*  Working on my computer. I'm pro tools. I like making music like making hip hop beats and stuff, you know
*  but if for years i've had these
*  Little details in that pro tools program that i've not unlocked little mysteries because I haven't had time to go in and figure out
*  How to mix and do like compression and do all the little things that you do
*  So i'm like going down that rabbit hole
*  I got my sound engineer calling me and i'm like doing online like doing on facetime like pro tools lessons
*  And i'm getting i'm having fun with it and i'm thinking okay
*  I'm doing something with myself right now that is positive
*  i'm enjoying that
*  and i'm trying to avoid, you know being hospitalized again because
*  I hate being in the hospital sucks. Yeah makes sense. Yeah
*  Um, are you
*  Doing anything differently in terms of how you eat or health wise or nutrients or taking care of your immune system?
*  Yeah, yes. I uh, well I heard you say zinc, uh on the show and I don't listen to me first of all
*  If you're getting your medical advice from me. Yeah. Well, no, I I had already had the zinc
*  I would but that confirmed that I was taking zinc
*  So i've taken zinc i've been taking a lot of articles you should read on it
*  But yeah zinc very good taking vitamins multivitamins vitamins, uh, and then uh, honestly i'm not drinking
*  as much
*  You know, it's unfortunate youtube said that they're going to take down anything that doesn't coincide with the world health organizations
*  Ruling on you know what to do about this pandemic
*  What do you mean?
*  Youtube is taking down things and now i don't know how specific they're going to be about this but they're saying
*  Alternate therapies like vitamin c and things along those lines
*  um, which is kind of unfortunate
*  because
*  like unless
*  They're not being that strict about it because I would say if someone's saying how do you if somebody made a video someone who's a nutrition expert?
*  And they made a video how to protect your own immune system from covid 19
*  Or maybe
*  Just protect your immune system during the time of covid 19
*  So i'm saying that it's protecting it from that but how to how to boost up your immune system in this very dangerous time
*  In terms of viral infections
*  Well, there's there are strategies
*  There's things you can do like get more sleep drink more water eat healthier
*  Keep your body healthy with nutrients and making sure you're eating clean
*  And don't drink alcohol and don't smoke cigarettes if you just do those things like this is real like this has actually been proven
*  So I don't know what you can get away with saying and what you can't get away with saying
*  But you can't always just hope that doctors come up with a cure because yes
*  The doctors are going to come up with a cure and yes, we need them to do that
*  But you can't always think that
*  Medicine is going to fix you and you can just keep doing what you've always been doing that got you sick in the first place
*  Because a lot of times when you get sick it has to do with how you've been living
*  Not always but a lot of times like is your immune system already compromised or are you already weak?
*  Are you beating up your body and abusing it and then boom then you catch a cold?
*  We all know that's true. So
*  Advice on how to strengthen your immune systems. It's important for everybody now if you want people to say
*  Don't say that. This is a cure for covet 19. It's going to keep you from getting covet 19. Fine. Great
*  But so what like youtube's going to take a video down that says I want this what i'm saying like if you take a lot of vitamins
*  Don't don't don't drink alcohol or during the time if it has to do with coronavirus and it's contrary or
*  Not in what the world health organization is recommended which changes every two weeks. Well, they fucked up. I mean there's
*  Wear a mask don't wear a mask wear a mask. Don't wear a mask good to wear a mask bad to wear a mask
*  What what somebody posted it on their twitter the other day?
*  Um from it might have been donald trump jr
*  But it showed the world health or no is on instagram world health organization a tweet from them
*  from
*  It was I guess it was a what time it was last year. I think it was last I think it was either december or
*  Maybe the beginning of this year, but they were saying that the world health organization says that it cannot be contracted from person to person
*  This is a tweet that they put out. So you can't say how the hell do you get it then?
*  Well, they didn't know then directly from a pangolin. Yeah, yeah, you have to be there. So don't worry about it
*  They're they're this is what they were getting chinese propaganda. They were spreading it
*  But the world health organization when they were posting it that was that's
*  Absolutely wrong. We all know that's absolutely wrong
*  So if you say you have to listen to what the world health organization says well, they've been wrong before right?
*  And I want to know how much they really know about nutrition
*  How much do they really know about health and fitness like i'm looking at these people?
*  They don't like the healthiest humans in the world just because someone's a scientist, you know what i'm saying?
*  Doesn't mean they're taking care of their own body. That's a problem. No, it's a smart guy, but he might not work out and
*  I've talked to a lot of really brilliant people including doctors that eat shitty food and don't really work out
*  So I realized I didn't have a lot of vegetables. So I ordered uh, you know, uh on amazon, which I'd never used amazon
*  By the way, i'm fresh
*  Uh, actually what it's called. Yeah, they were taking too long to deliver actually
*  They actually aren't weren't even delivering when I ordered this but there's there's other stuff on amazon. It's not amazon fresh
*  Uh canned corn, okay
*  I ordered like a couple dozen cans of corn
*  So I have that and I sometimes i'll mix that in i've been cooking so to stay healthy i've been cooking
*  I like to cook anyways, I like to cook anyways, I believe you I do say that twice like you're trying to convince me
*  Yeah, because it seems like it might not be a believable thing, but but I do like to cook why would it be believable?
*  Uh, I don't know. It just seems I just you see i'm surprised by it. So I figured others might be but i'm not at all
*  Yeah, I like to cook, uh, but i'm not an ex
*  I just kind of I kind of have a sense for it
*  I know I can usually tell that i'm going to like it just by the smells of things and so i'll like
*  so
*  I have canned corn. I've been cooking a lot of
*  Pasta i've been you know, I I have I have stuff i've do I go live on my instagram story
*  I do a little cooking show sort of I mean, it's not i'm not saying it's a cooking show
*  But I do I do whenever I cook I do a little instagram story. I got these uh,
*  You know the san marzano tomatoes. Okay, what are those?
*  They're just like can of tomatoes, but they're cans of peeled tomatoes
*  So they're delicious tomatoes, but they last forever because they're canned so you can have a closet full of them
*  And they'll last forever and you'll always have tomatoes
*  Then i've got the the stuff when I make pasta. It's called um, like ragu
*  Okay, or prego sauce crazy. That's exotic
*  Yeah when I make sauce, but I add the tomatoes to it thicken it up throw some canned mushrooms in there
*  Why are you buying ragu tomato sauce? It's just to have it don't do it. No, no
*  No, it's just to have it because in case of uh, you know in case like
*  You know
*  System is if I can't get food for a while. I've got some some backup food, you know
*  because you remember in the first few weeks of this people were kind of thinking
*  is
*  Is everything going to shut down right? And so I I made sure I had some canned food, you know, like they said right
*  But why ragu?
*  There's other brands you get. Uh, yeah
*  Well, I have prego too
*  I got the ragu the the ragu is the alfredo sauce and the prego is the is the marinara sauce
*  But what i'm saying is my cooking my personal recipe for spaghetti
*  Don't just doesn't just heat up the ragu put in some canned tomatoes in it way better. Okay
*  So i'm getting i'm you know, but I wouldn't normally do that. I wouldn't normally have canned corn
*  I wouldn't normally think about having vegetables the kind of person that i'll eat rice
*  So do you think you had a premonition or do you think you saw what was going on in china and you were like
*  You know what? It would be a good move to have a month's worth of food here
*  Yeah, like it's not like some sort of a superstitious thing. You don't feel like like the the universe was sending you a signal
*  You needed to go buy corn
*  well, uh
*  I watched one of your shows recently where you're talking about uh
*  I love this episode where you're talking about are we living in a simulation? Yes. Okay, so I was um
*  You know, I love talking about this stuff, you know, it doesn't mean that i'm oh I think we're living in a simulation
*  Oh, I think that we you know, doom's day is coming not necessarily
*  But I do love the thought experiment of talking about it and thinking about it
*  And so after I was watching that show your show I was really thinking about a lot. I had a long conversation with my mom
*  About how you know, we could be living in a simulation, you know, what do you mean?
*  Well, I mean, you know the the computers are getting so fast
*  I mean they're going to be able to program computers that have conscious
*  You know that little character on the computer might be able to start to think and then it might start to be able to self-determine
*  And then we could just be an advanced version of that and how would we ever know and my mom's sitting there going
*  I don't know. What are you talking about?
*  and then I had a pretty
*  Long day of talking about this with my mom and trying to convince her not that we're living in simulation
*  But that it's possible we could be living in a simulation. My mother wasn't really buying it, right?
*  And then two weeks later this happens and i'm thinking
*  Is this like because we're living in a simulation, you know
*  because if you were living in a simulation and then you started talking about it and then the
*  Creator of the simulation heard that
*  He might start a pandemic. Maybe the problem is the term simulation. Yeah
*  Because if you're living in a simulation then it becomes your whole life
*  Like is that simulated anymore? Like what is that?
*  Like maybe it's always been a simulation
*  maybe
*  If you stop and think about events that take place that ultimately all seem to be leading
*  towards events, right when when you think about the invention of electricity and then the
*  Electronics of the 80s and the 90s that led to everyone having a home computer that led to everybody having a computer in your pocket
*  it listens to everything you say and takes pictures and uploads video and
*  Just keeps getting more and more advanced and more and more intertwined with you being a person until one day
*  You enter it and you become a part of it and it they create something
*  Inside the world of computers. It's far more compelling than the regular world itself
*  But maybe that's just the natural course of progression and that's where life is going
*  Anyway, like maybe that's just a new kind of life a new dimension of life and that
*  All these things just come about through that they come about through either natural causes like, you know star supernovaing
*  and you know everything coalesces and things become
*  Carbon based life forms emerge and and life becomes what it is in 2020
*  Or those things
*  Figure out how to open up new realities and that what a simulation would be would just be another reality
*  That we were created
*  By some person doing the exact same thing that we're doing right now
*  That one day we get to the point where technology is so spectacularly advanced
*  That you could have a new
*  World that's indiscernible like you can't tell that it's not real, right?
*  It's impossible to tell you are in that world now and that's where you exist
*  That's what I was trying to convince my mother that we might actually be in it's possible. She wasn't buying it dude
*  Elon Musk thinks that
*  Elon Musk thinks that he freaks me out. I know I saw that and on your show too
*  He's one of those have you ever talked to him? No, no, but look him in his eyes
*  You're like what's going on there man? Oh, yeah extra shit's happening in there. Yeah, because
*  When you got a guy that intelligent and he's saying there's a one percent chance or one in a billion chance that we're not living in
*  a simulation you think
*  Okay, so you just messing with me or uh, what was it?
*  What was the gentleman's name that I was having that discussion with bolstrom
*  Bostrom nick bostrom. Yeah, yeah, that's so sure. I think I was watching. Yeah, that was a very complicated discussion
*  We're talking about probability theory the probability of us having
*  Living life inside of a simulation is actually higher
*  Because ultimately we're going to come up with a simulation someday and then when you talk about this stuff enough
*  And when you watch your show which I do and you listen to these complex conversations, right?
*  And you start thinking about it and you start thinking about all the possibilities of what could happen
*  and then the this pandemic happens and then
*  you know
*  Yeah, yes, I still live in the same place where I did the show, you know, it's like
*  I started seeing you know, i'm here in los angeles. You saw him too. All of a sudden you're seeing blackhawk helicopters going by
*  Right, you're seeing apache helicopters going by you're seeing uh,
*  um
*  The ospreys you see the ospreys going by
*  Every day in the first week of this and you're thinking what's going on man. Do you watch the walking dead?
*  You know, I I haven't watched it. Let me tell you something. I know that's crazy walking dead
*  The first few seasons were awesome. I'm gonna hear about it now
*  The first few seasons were awesome, but maybe even better is the first season of the la version of the walking dead
*  What's that one called?
*  Fear of the walking dead, right? Oh something like that. The first the first
*  Couple episodes of that are spectacular. Yeah, it's the first season is pretty good
*  But it's they they did it very differently than the other walking dead
*  But you know it just like where it people it takes a while for people to realize what the fuck is happening
*  It sort of felt like is that the time in the beginning in the beginning?
*  Oh, yeah, man in the beginning it felt touch and go when everybody was hoarding all the
*  Toilet paper and people were fighting. Yeah, whoa
*  And everyone wants a gun the gun lines were giant, right?
*  The blinds outside the gun stores were creepy. Yeah. Yeah, were you in one of those lines?
*  Sure. Yeah, I'm I'm not waiting in line. I have a theory about the toilet paper. Maybe it's obvious but but
*  I don't know. Maybe it's not obvious. I don't know so toilet paper is big
*  Yes
*  So because it's big takes up a lot of shelf space because it takes up a lot of maybe everyone's talked about this already
*  But maybe it takes up a lot of shelf space
*  So all of a sudden everybody went to the grocery store at the same time and there's probably far less toilet paper at the grocery store
*  Than it would appear just because it takes an entire aisle because it's big so
*  Everybody what bought one piece of package of toilet paper on the first day. It was instantly all gone
*  It's instantly an entire empty aisle, which is dramatic looking
*  And it was the first sign of shelves being cleared and it was the toilet paper was gone and everyone went on their fucking phones
*  There's there's putting a run of toilet paper and all of a sudden that compounded it
*  Exponentially and now everyone's going for the toilet paper and they don't need to be going for the toilet paper
*  And we had the great toilet paper shortage of 2020
*  This is the type of investigative reporting you do when you're alone for five weeks just go. Hmm. Oh, yeah breaking it down
*  The colombo of toilet paper
*  That makes 100 sense because it's big everyone grabbed a can of corn everyone grabs a can of beans
*  But it didn't create an entire empty aisle that then got people thinking talking and and tweeting and typing and instagramming
*  It's also something dumb people think about a lot of shitting
*  Yeah, yeah, that's you know, that's right. You also you know, you don't want to not be able to wipe your ass for
*  Yeah, but it's out of all the things you need like do you understand what it's like when shit goes down get a rag
*  And a bucket of water. Okay, right wash your ass with a washcloth, right? Because shit is going down
*  Yeah, all right. That's the last thing you need to worry about is toilet paper
*  You need to worry about consuming food and staying alive
*  Yeah, some people don't think it's ever gonna get to that and those are the ones that stock up on toilet paper
*  Yeah, the ones who buy like rice and beans and stuff like that. Those are the people that are planning
*  They're legitimately planning ahead. You want to stay alive?
*  They say, you know, that's right. Use a home beans corn and uh rice is a that's what I read was a subsist
*  Enough enough vitamins and everything you need. So sure you don't get enough protein that way, but you get some from beans
*  Oh really? Yeah, it's just not as available
*  It's not as bioavailable as it is in other foods. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so you can get some protein
*  You just gotta eat a lot. Yeah, it's not as complete as some forms of protein
*  so how have you been, uh
*  enjoying doing the podcast since this started obviously
*  Becomes a big subject of conversation, right? Uh, do you do you sometimes not want to talk about it anymore?
*  I mean we could
*  When your guests come in is everyone always talking about the pandemic and what they're eating about them, man
*  I want to just talk to you just go with the flow. Yeah, we're just having a conversation sometimes it's repetitive
*  Unfortunately, because the people that are listening in they listen to me having conversations people that haven't heard the other conversations, right?
*  And we wind up talking about the same shit. Yeah, but that's it seems
*  Like as uh, the more I think about doing it
*  The best way to do is just talk to people just have talk just talk just think about what you would how would you normally talk?
*  Yeah, you'd have to talk about this if I didn't see my friend tom green in a long time
*  Then all of a sudden we're here and like bro, what the fuck is going on?
*  Well, we're just gonna ignore it exactly because really we only talked for like there was a couple times
*  We were having conversations out there. We were like gotta save it
*  Because I haven't seen you in a while, but
*  Gotta talk about it. It's mad. We're living in madness
*  It's a weird thing when you talk about something in the hallway
*  I told you the story but i'll tell you now i'm doing now i'm doing what I said I don't want to do but
*  He's dead mcmahon used to come up and do my web show that we were talking about and you know
*  johnny carson's
*  Psychic, I never got to meet johnny carson, but I got to meet ed mcmahon. That's pretty dope that you met ed mcmahon
*  Yeah, we became friendly. He came and did it all the time
*  He did it like really he did like four times or something. Wow, because he I think he just yeah, I had a curtain
*  He had a kind of shiny curtain. Yeah, I had a desk
*  At the the desk the chair and I just think he felt like it was fun for him. No pressure
*  We're doing a little kind of make-believe tonight show or whatever
*  That's awesome
*  And he'd come up and I was just so overjoyed that he was there and we'd stand in the hallway and let's start
*  Talking to him and he'd say
*  I could tell he'd get quiet
*  He was never quiet on the show, but he'd get quiet before the show
*  And I was like is he not in a good mood in the first couple times and he said
*  Don't leave it in the hallway tom don't leave it in the hallway and I realized oh he doesn't want to have the same
*  conversation again and it made it a lot easier for me
*  as the host
*  Of the show in my living room because then I didn't feel
*  Obligated to talk to him either and we just sat there in silence for half an hour until the show started
*  We fucked that up a bunch of times on this podcast. Yeah, not not this you and I
*  I was trying to kind of talk about things that weren't going to come up
*  I mean like the early days of the podcast sometimes before we ever got the show started we had talked about all the coolest shit
*  Yeah
*  And they're like fuck what were we just talking about?
*  Oh, I forgot man
*  Yeah
*  And then you're talking about it again
*  And you and you know you're talking about again and they know and you're sort of then you're trying to pretend that you haven't
*  Heard it before and you're kind of doing this sort of sort of can't really force the laugh
*  But you do and then it doesn't feel right
*  awkward
*  Yeah, yeah, but uh, you know, I mean I look I look I love that. I love the little
*  The little I love the rhythm to these kinds of conversations. That's something that I really love, you know
*  Like I've you know, as you know, I've loved doing what you do. I love doing this. I love talking to people. I love
*  creating a
*  you know, whether it's an interview or conversation, I love
*  Listening to people and just waiting and feeling that rhythm of it. It's something that's very
*  Interesting to me which took a long time to figure out and that's what's kind of exciting about
*  You know doing this stuff as you do learn as you do these shows and where else would you ever have the opportunity?
*  In the history of broadcasting right to have built your own studio and go. Oh, I'm going to do you know
*  What are you how many thousand shows have you done now? I'm going to do a thousand shows, right? I mean you've got more
*  you know time as a interviewer than
*  Anyone like in history other than the few
*  Handful of people that had shows that didn't get canceled right everyone else
*  They got a chance to do a talk show
*  They get to do it for a few weeks or a few months or a few years and then they get cancelled
*  Well, there's radio guys radio guys have been doing it for over like stern. Mm-hmm. Yes way way way more. Yeah
*  That's what I'm saying. You know, you're in that that category of people where you've got 10,000 hours of of
*  Interviewing time, you know, it's pretty pretty pretty awesome. It's pretty weird. Yeah, it's not 10,000 hours
*  Yeah, it's a thousand how many thousand hours like a thousand something three
*  Thousand show fifteen hundred shows fifteen hundred shows and the longest ones are like
*  Well, there's a few five hour ones in there
*  The kevin smith one a couple of them that were like four or five hours most of them are three or under
*  Yeah, yeah was it in the early days of it? Okay when you were doing it in your house
*  How long did you?
*  Love it being in the house. And then at what point did it start to be like I'm gonna don't want to do this in
*  My house anymore. Well when I was bringing over people that I didn't know
*  Then I was like just to see this feels awkward bring bring them to my house. It just feels like it also feels like I was
*  You know, I it wasn't the right setup
*  I wanted I was like well if i'm doing this all the time. I should have like a better setup
*  I should figure out how to do this better. So for a while red band set up at the ice house
*  We did it there
*  We just did a show together red ben and I we did a weekend at san diego at the at the american comedy company
*  Right like right before this that's a great little club. Yeah, I love that. So red ben
*  I love san diego san diego is an awesome spot for comedy, too. Yeah
*  Um, so and then um, I got a place near here that was smaller
*  And then I was like, okay, I need to I want to build something crazy
*  I want to build something where it's like what would I do if I was me, you know, like if you're like
*  Oh if I was tom green, I would set up a fucking internet studio in my house
*  Well, if I was joe rogan, what would I do?
*  I would yeah, I should have all the shit that I want like a gym and you know float tank
*  Sauna incredible that's um
*  That's the most fun part about this place
*  Is it like but you could never have a place like this if you had like a real company behind you?
*  You know, I mean like if you had if you were an employee like showtime
*  Showtime put some tom green show together and you're like, oh, so I want I want an indoor archery range like listen
*  We can't do that. Yeah, you can you're gonna kill somebody crossbow in the in the studio. No, maybe not
*  Yeah, well, I want to set up a gym. Well, hold on. We need everyone to sign a waiver
*  We're gonna enter this gym. You're lifting weights. This is crazy. Let me talk to the lawyers
*  Tom the the gym has to be in a separate building and you have to have key cards to get into it
*  And everyone has to sign a release
*  You would never be able to put whatever you want on the walls you wouldn't be able to it wouldn't be the same
*  And then there's always the looming possibility of it all being taken away
*  That's what we were talking about on your show. That was that conversation in 2007. I just put up the the the the
*  You know the the pictures sorry pulling the plug on it. Yeah. Yeah, what did we just bought all the new furniture?
*  We heard you say dyke. Yeah, you said it. It's all over
*  You called us some lovely woman a dyke
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, it's uh, it's it's amazing
*  But but was there a moment though in in your house when you were doing it where something happened that made you say this is
*  You know like like did anyone know did anyone ever come up and not want to leave after no
*  No, no, it's nothing bad
*  No, it just seemed like a that it just always seems like it's time to do something new
*  See what I would my problem was I was drinking a lot more back then
*  So
*  You drink now at all. I do do you but a lot less actually i'll tell you when I started doing stand-up again
*  10 or 11 years ago. I started doing it again. Have a drink right now. Uh, sure. Yeah, of course
*  A couple of drinks, of course I will
*  Have a drink with you on your show, of course a little bit just like a clip of us drinking. Yeah, of course. Um,
*  but
*  Absolutely. I will but uh, you know, the thing is is I don't as much anymore and back then I I was you're boozing
*  A little too much. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, and I think I think what I thought was
*  I got a little too carried away with the idea of hey we can drink on the show, you know, right right right
*  I remember that we were drinking coronas. Yeah, that's one of the things that people were pointing out like
*  Oh, this is a you're gonna get a corona beer. Yeah, we're on a beer took a big hit
*  So crazy, I bet yeah people are so dumb. They're blaming the name of the beer
*  On a virus. Yeah, I was thinking in the beginning like hey
*  Why don't they just call it covet 19 or something just to to you know, this company's anyways, what if corona just changed?
*  They had a covet 19
*  Like a special edition have some fun with it. Yeah
*  Grandpa's dead. Have some fun. Yeah, he died choking on his own
*  Lung fluid so I was having fun with that and uh, but I uh, I feel like uh,
*  I feel like that maybe uh, I forgot where I was going with that. But the point is is uh,
*  I uh, oh nice
*  What do we got any more bottles? This this thing's almost empty. Ooh
*  A little whiskey there, huh?
*  That's my drink. I've been drinking bushmills. Oh, is that a specific type? It's from belfast. It's uh, irish whiskey
*  It's a healthy pour there. That's cool jude. Awesome. Beautiful. Thank you. Well, I
*  I won't I won't be having any more. I'll just have this that's fine. That's all you need a little sip
*  It's not bad for you. It's been proven. Sorry. What is that? That's uh buffalo trace
*  This company's been around since 1773 son. Oh, I heard you talking about sponsors. I heard you talking about that
*  Look, there's actual buffalo testicles on the label. Oh, wow. Don't make me jealous
*  Respect I used to have two of those
*  But um, so we're talking about drinking doing the studio you said you
*  It got a little carried away because you could drink there. Oh, I know where I was going with it. Yeah, so
*  So yeah, so
*  So of course people like to drink my guests like to drink too. I have a lot of great guests coming up
*  You know, sometimes we'd have a few too many sometimes
*  Turned into every time we had a few too many turned into
*  It turned into a party every night. It turned into a party that never ended every night
*  It turned into you know, you know, I remember like I had great stories too. Don't get me wrong. It was bad
*  I mean, I remember norm mcdonald would come up and I you know, i'm from norm's from Ottawa. Okay, i'm from Ottawa
*  Canada the capital of canada, okay
*  um
*  I I grew up loving norm. Okay, like because when I was a teenager I was doing amateur night. They called it
*  That's what they used to call opening my open mic nights at yuck yucks in Ottawa amateur night
*  I'd do that and norm would come through town. He hadn't he hadn't
*  Blown up yet. He is norm. He was 25 years old. He was my favorite him and harland williams and jeremy harts
*  Those guys were my favorite
*  and so
*  Having grown up idolizing
*  Those guys and then all of a sudden they're up at my house and now we're having a drink and now the show ends now
*  The show ends and norm's having fun. I'm having fun. Let's go look at some youtube videos
*  So now we're watching youtube videos till four or five in the morning
*  And then that starts happening every night with other people and everybody and every all of a sudden
*  It's like i'm wake up in the morning. You know, there's
*  Beers like the floor sticky like my floor in my house, you know, i've got a nice place, right?
*  The floor is sticky, right? And then and then the then the housing
*  Crash the housing market crashed and I was doing this thing and the oh, here's another thing
*  Okay, the technology changed and so every like few months
*  Oh, the cameras are obsolete, you know
*  The four by three cameras don't fit in the aspect ratio. You got to get all new cameras. Okay, so i'll go spend
*  Six thousand dollars on new cameras just to keep it working
*  I've already spent all okay
*  And then the house is worth like half of what I paid for and i'm like am I underwater here and the force and not
*  To mention that the floor the floor is sticky that i've screwed things into the ceiling. I've ruined it
*  I've ruined the house that's worth half of what I paid for i'm like
*  Maybe I should move that get rid of the studio out of the house. This is not healthy
*  But no and there was also you know, uh this did you want a semblance of normalcy? Didn't you want a house?
*  Well, it also what happened was
*  Cheers cheers
*  Also what happened was um
*  You know I had I
*  Was becoming increasingly frustrated with my inability to monetize it. Okay, and and because it was it just wasn't really
*  What people were doing quite yet?
*  And I had people all over the world calling in and watching we were getting a lot of views we were getting
*  The break the moment when I realized
*  Something cool was happening
*  With the views we figured this thing out cat von d came on the show. Okay, the the you know cat fundy
*  She came on the show
*  She had a myspace page with like a gazillion followers
*  This is a funny story actually
*  I hope it is at least we uh, we we embedded the feed to her myspace page
*  All of a sudden we had a million views on that one feed. Oh my god, this is amazing then
*  The end of the month comes
*  I get a bill from the server company
*  We hadn't talked about if you had a million views a bill for forty thousand dollars
*  They go well we charge per clicks. I mean now that's the new then
*  We always had this thing but now we have a thing where it's so I mean in fairness to them
*  They didn't make me pay it but they wanted me to pay it until I was crying on the phone
*  This is you know, I just got new cameras this is great
*  I mean the ceilings got holes in it, you know, I mean
*  So they didn't make me pay it. Thank you for thank you very much to everybody, uh that I won't even say their name in that story
*  But thank you to them for that, but it became a lot of pressure
*  Uh financial pressure to keep it going. I'd been doing it for a long time. I'd grown kind of
*  You know
*  I started to find myself annoyed with doing it, you know, and then
*  I just one day just realized
*  I want to start doing stand-up again
*  And I just I'd always wanted to right I did it when I was a kid. It was always felt like a thing that I'd
*  You know, I when I was doing stand-up, I stopped when I started my public access show because I got i'm a focus
*  I focus right so I had the I had the public access show. I don't have time to do that anymore
*  I focused on that right for for 10 years
*  and in the back of my mind, I was always like man
*  I I left that on the table, you know
*  so I
*  Found that that was going to be my way of monetizing my web show was i'm going to go on tour and all of a sudden
*  I started I jumped up the comedy store and I felt that feeling you know
*  That feeling and felt and since I was you know, 19 was the last time I'd done it, you know
*  And and I and I did well, right? It was like the fear of like, oh am I gonna bomb or they're gonna you know
*  It was just instantly gone and I realized shit and then I went back. I started going back going back going back
*  Then then I started then I started getting booked and then all of a sudden
*  You know six years of doing the web show and paying for it out of my pocket and worrying about it and all of a sudden
*  Whoa, i'm i'm like making good money doing stand-up. I like this idea getting paid to do
*  What I love to do as opposed to paying for what I love to do. And so then I'd come home from the road
*  And the equipment was getting more obsolete too, you know, it was like it was like he was dust on it
*  You know and like the camera work, you know, you turn it on it wouldn't work as well
*  you know like you'd have to figure and and and and i'd come home and I
*  Look at this house and I didn't I was tired from being on the road. I didn't want to turn on the studio
*  I thought you know
*  I'm going to take the studio out of the house and i'm going to go focus on on on on trying to
*  Become as good of a stand-up as I can possibly be
*  And this is what year what year to start?
*  It's probably about 11 years ago
*  So yeah, and so and then i've been on the road for the last 11 years like, you know
*  I mean i've talked a bit about this but i've been going hard man. I've been going everywhere
*  I've been all over the world and and every every club in the us and i'm loving it and I just love doing it
*  and I feel you know what I love about stand-up is I know it's it's and I i'm
*  I'm not sure if this is true at your point. But for me
*  I still feel like every time I get on stage. I feel like i'm learning something and getting better at it
*  So every single time yeah, we've done thousands of shows, but then how could I?
*  How can I walk off stage and feel like that was the best show?
*  That's what I said the last time that's what I said the time before that's what I said the time before
*  But I love that feeling of like oh there's somewhere
*  We're moving somewhere with this. We're moving in a we're we're figuring something out. It's very fulfilling
*  Well, it's clearly something that the more you do it the better you get at it
*  If you're enthusiastic and you're concentrating on it the more you do it the better you get at it
*  And the the more years you have in it's like the more data
*  You've processed how to do it right how to do it wrong and how to what to avoid and what to emphasize and all these different things
*  They they just get to a greater and greater understanding of this thing
*  So really there is a difference between like 10 years and 20 years 20 years and 30 years
*  And really you really do keep as long as you really are still passionate about it
*  Yeah, we'll still get it get better at it. Dom Herrera said this to me and Dom's been doing it longer than me
*  I remember watching Dom on tv when I was thinking about doing comedy
*  He was already on tv, right and when I became friends with him
*  he was like one of the first guys that was friends was like I can't believe I'm friends with Dom Herrera and
*  To this day Dom's been doing comedy probably 40 fucking years to this day
*  He still says, you know, you just keep concentrating on it. You still get better
*  Like that is the craziest thing isn't it?
*  It's like you just if you're as long as you're still locked in and some guys like Dom are still locked in like
*  He still crushes seeing Dom at the comedy star crush, which is so inspiring. Oh with new shit
*  Yeah, yeah, just walking around light light with the audience having a good time
*  Been doing it forever still loves it still loves doing stand-up and I think that's what's up
*  It's like whatever you're doing whether it was your public access show or whether it's you doing stand-up or maybe you become an author
*  Whatever the fuck it is that thing you just have to really be all in on that thing and really be interested in that thing
*  And if you are you're gonna get better at it
*  You're gonna get better at it
*  Just keep I mean you're gonna have bad times and good times and jokes that suck and jokes that are better and some jokes
*  You have to abandon they're never gonna work you try them like what is wrong with this?
*  I can't seem to get let me just put it aside for a little bit and you might come back to it two years from
*  Now you're like, oh that tomato joke
*  And then you go back and then you start fucking around with the tomato bit again you bring it
*  We reintroduce it to the crowd. You never know man. It's a it's a like a living forest of ideas
*  That's what a an act is
*  it's like a life form and it's like you you fertilize it with information and
*  Knowledge and and you keep paying attention to it constantly in a good way too
*  Just like you're supposed to sing to plants like pay attention to that act like go there with enthusiasm be happy that you can do it
*  And this is one thing that's gonna happen to a lot of comics after this break
*  Come back. You're gonna be so
*  Thankful. Yeah, so thankful that you can make people feel good that we can all have a night out together
*  Yeah, where you know people come and they're on dates and they're just happy to be there and they're they're they're there to have a good time
*  And the comics are so happy that everybody's there and everybody gets just a good old lovefest out of it
*  Just let's appreciate what we had. I think we all appreciate what we had at the store
*  But I think now everyone's gonna really really appreciate how special that place is and how special stand-up comedy is across the world
*  It's a special thing to be able to get in front of people and and and make your ideas change their physical state
*  You know when people are laughing about something they're having a great time at someone's killing on stage
*  It changes. It's like you're giving them a happy drug when someone makes you laugh. It feels good
*  That's what we gravitate towards stand-up when joey d is on stage crushing you feel good. You're like
*  That feeling that you get it's like everything feels amazing and you and I get to feel that all the time
*  we're so
*  Lucky we get to hang out with some of the best
*  funniest people in the world and make each other laugh and just joke around and hang out in that back bar and and
*  Tell war stories and just laugh and have so much fun
*  And I think one great thing about this for us is it's going to make us appreciate
*  How special and how fortunate that is I think for a lot of other people?
*  During this time off that have been like on the fence about quitting what they do
*  I bet a lot of people are going to change course in their career
*  I bet a lot of people are going to realize you know what this could all be just taken away from me
*  I'm playing it safe and even though i'm playing it safe doing something
*  I don't want to do it still got taken away from me and I didn't even have a chance to take a chance
*  I was trying to do this thing and do the right thing and follow my degree and
*  Now they're going to go since this can be taken away from me at any time
*  I'm going to do what I want to do. Yeah, i'm going to i'm going to try to find
*  Out how to make a career at whatever their interest is whether it's making tents or fucking painting whatever it is
*  For whatever it is making tents some people are into making somebody literally is making into making tents for sure
*  At what point do they decide they want to do that though at what point in life when they're kid camping they go someday
*  I'm gonna make a better one of these this thing's leaking right now. Exactly. This thing's they shouldn't be leaking like this
*  Sure, and that's how they make this better sleeping bags
*  Some people make better, uh, you know those little burner stoves those stoves that people take when they go hiking
*  Someone goes this thing sucks. I'm gonna make a better one these fucks
*  And they
*  Make a better one. They sell it to rei and the next thing you know, it's the hot thing if you're going camping
*  Yeah, i have it. There's some
*  Yeah, there's some crazy tents out there now, too
*  I'm sure you know you probably do a lot more camping than I do. I don't camp that often
*  But uh when you go on the hunt, you know, I have set up some crazy new new new model tent
*  I have but I prefer to do the most miserable well
*  I
*  Think the most miserable is rain because cold you can get warm like i've done montana
*  We did the mizzo being brian cowell and with my friend steve renell and his crew for the meat eater show
*  We did the missouri breaks in montana. Okay in october and it was cold as fuck
*  It was like nine degrees some days that was cold, but that's not as miserable as wet. What's more miserable one time?
*  We did prince of wales, which is the most rainy part of uh, alaska
*  Okay. Yeah, it's an island and uh, it was rough
*  It's like all day long you're soaking wet like you the tent is wet your sleeping bag's wet
*  This the air you see when you turn your headlamp you go piss in the middle of the night just mist
*  There's water everywhere. Everything's wet. You're never going to dry off and it's not warm out
*  I love that though
*  Even though it's uncomfortable. It's I love getting i've done a lot of that. Okay. I've done a lot of camping
*  Canadian right my dad was an army guy. My dad was captain in the canadian army
*  So he made you go camp and pretend the russians are coming. Yeah. Oh, yeah
*  No for real
*  Yeah, it was
*  It was serious. It was sort of uh, it was an authoritarian kind of thing. You had to be good with nature
*  Uh when I was 14 years old, I got really into skateboarding, right?
*  I'd already been due to but when you start to become a teenager somehow
*  I don't know how this happens, but somehow with skateboarding you equate
*  The ability to be able to do something like that really well
*  With maybe the ability to be popular or to maybe get girls or something if I can do a jump, right?
*  and i'm really so you just you're as I think it's a male energy thing or like a like a
*  You know, you start to feel like
*  I gotta be the best skateboarder
*  So I all of a sudden like, you know, I don't know what what what kind of energy it is. I don't want to be sexist
*  It's a human energy sure there's girls that are like really obsessed with doing things to be the best at it back that up
*  Back that up. It's a human energy, right? You want to be successful?
*  You want to be the best skateboarder?
*  So this was the moment where I wanted to be the best skateboarder
*  But I was 14 and I was still a kid but I was on the verge of being a teenager
*  I was a teenager, but I was on the verge of being you know an adult, you know
*  I feel like we should have some music playing in the background of the story all of a sudden
*  Dad says we're i'm sending you this summer
*  on a
*  canoe
*  Expedition it's eight weeks in northern canada. You're going out with this like group of 12
*  It was this whole organized thing. It's actually an american group. It was called. I remember it was called lorian
*  Okay, it was an american group from upstate new york. They drove up they
*  A group of 12 people and they were divided into like five
*  Groups of 12 that would go out into the middle
*  You know what? It's like in northern canada. It's like you're in the middle of nowhere, right?
*  You're going out into lake kippewa in northern quebec and i'll show you the middle of canada
*  Yeah, you see the middle of canada. Yeah, my friends live in alberta. Shout out to my friends john and jen
*  What's up, john sent me an image. You want to pull it up on the big screen?
*  Jen rivet
*  She sent me a picture of her fucking backyard
*  Yeah, and in her backyard. Yeah, there was a giant fucking grizzly bear just wandering around in her backyard
*  Hold please look at that. That's her yard
*  Man, what the fuck dude? Look at the size of that thing. Yeah, not in her yard lucky to see that actually
*  That's a 10 foot grizzly. I don't know how big it is
*  But it looks like that looks like that could be a 10 foot. That's that's a nice thing to be able to see that's a big
*  Till it's running towards you see how wide shoulders are how much muscle it has in its arms
*  That's not a small bear look at the size in the big picture beautiful
*  What in the christ?
*  Jesus they have them up there where they have to shut school down sometimes like where their kids go to school
*  It'll just wander through the fucking schoolyard a grizzly bear
*  Jesus and they're probably just used to it. I've got a friend who lives in pasadena. The bear comes down every
*  eats avocados out of his tree
*  Clearly my friend's doing well. He's got avocado trees in his yard, but he's ballin. Yeah, that's a low-key flex
*  Yeah, oh, yeah bears eat my avocado trees. What you got an avocado tree. Yeah, so they did there. Yeah, absolutely
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, let you know about his avocados. Oh, yeah, but uh, you know, no he uh, talk about him later, but he's a great guy
*  Incredible talented genius, but we're talking about uh, so I was I put you up there and they was
*  So I was out there eight weeks out of you type deal kind of well when my dad was when my dad was uh, you know
*  Kid he joined the cadets right? He was he joined the army left school went joined the army
*  He went back to school. He got a college degree later. He would
*  Just to clarify dad if you're watching but he is watching too, by the way, my parents are watching so
*  So, you know you're on oh they know
*  But uh listen so it was sort of this
*  You know, you got to know how to be a man
*  You know how to deal with nature and I went out and I i'd grown up
*  Fishing with my dad a lot of fishing never hunting but a lot of fishing
*  You know northern pike largemouth bass, you know, I like I love fishing and uh
*  And I was actually the you know, the the only canadian on this tour and we'd go out into the middle and over we'd do it
*  every day there'd be a like a
*  Sometimes up to three kilometer long portage where you'd have to take so today we're doing a portage
*  We're going to take all our bags all our food all our supplies
*  We're going to walk
*  Three miles or whatever three kilometers is that what you call portage portage? Yeah portage when you pick up you
*  I thought it was portage
*  Oh, yeah
*  No, it's french french canadian because the voyagers right where the french canadian fur traders who came down from northern canada with the hudson's
*  Bay company selling their beaver pelts and all this stuff the portage right so that's funny because
*  You're thinking of portage avenue in winnipeg, which is a mistake no, okay
*  I'm not i'm thinking of portage like carrying hilarious if it was a winnipeg thing that you were thinking of
*  I don't think i've ever heard the word said or said it myself. Mm portage. Yeah, okay french canadian
*  So but I digress. Yeah, we we but uh, so
*  so
*  It was a lot of work, you know
*  And uh, you'd have to carry your canoe and then you have to go back three miles and then you have to pick up all
*  Your food and all that stuff. It was a pretty intense thing. You know what they had was every
*  Two weeks a float plane would come in would land they'd resupply the 12 groups of people and then everyone would go off in their own
*  Direction so we were off there with like maybe 12 people and I don't think they would do this anymore
*  It was like one instructor guy who was probably 25 years old and I was 14 with a bunch of 14 year olds
*  and uh
*  You know fishing and you know, I love it. I love being out there in the middle of nowhere fishing is so fun
*  It's such a great feeling to like catch something and then cook it like if you can cook it like within
*  A close amount of time to when you just caught it. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  Group sparks those primal fires. Yeah, largemouth bass, you know largemouth bass
*  Ate a lot of largemouth bass over the years. Sorry people but a lot of people don't like eating largemouth bass. Isn't that interesting?
*  Yeah, yeah, they were they were prevalent in this lake. We went to largemouth bass northern pike and uh smallmouth
*  Which put up a better fight than the largemouth. Oh, yeah smallmouths are tough. It tastes better, too. What's your favorite? Um
*  Lure
*  For what situation top water lures because it's exciting when they hit okay
*  Yeah, you know if you have like a jitterbug or a rapala or a palla
*  Yeah, you're twitching it and then you see something come up and smash the water. That's always the most exciting to me
*  But I like uh, you know, I like fishing with all kinds of lure spinners and crank baits
*  I always like casting crank baits into lily pads for bass
*  That's fun because you can kind of pull it across the surface of the water. You see the bass explode crank bait
*  What's that? That might be I don't know that bait is uh, it's got like uh the skirt like the flowy skirt
*  Rubber worm type of thing over the over the hook with well, it's a what is it called?
*  It's called I think it's called a crank. I think that's called a crank bait
*  I'm saying it's a little different tippet terminologies with canada and the u.s
*  too, so
*  Because like we would we got a little metal thing like a wire. Oh, yeah, it connects one on one side
*  it's just I think
*  They would either call it I don't think they would call it a spinner a spinner is like a small little lure
*  Yeah, that spins when you pull it through the water. That's oh, that's a crank bait. So i'm using the wrong terminology
*  That's like that's like a fat lip
*  One that you can move on. I've done looks like I think I call those jitterbucks
*  but what are the ones where there's the spinner on one side and the
*  god damn it
*  I forget the word
*  Where it's like it looks like like there's a coat hanger almost
*  Between the two of them and on one side those are pretty big right? Yeah, they're like musky and stuff
*  I think they would maybe you would call it a you wouldn't call it a spinner. Yeah
*  Just a lure of some spinner bait. That's it spinner bait. Okay, that's what it is. I had a pattern
*  I pretty much used spinners for bass. I put a worm on it. See what that looks like. Oh, yeah. Yeah
*  I never knew what to call those are yeah
*  It's been so long since I used a little spinner on the end of it
*  I used to use one of these like literally 30 years ago. Yeah, I put a I put a spinner with
*  With with a worm on it for bass
*  I like to use um
*  Rapalas the best fishing experience I ever had was nighttime with my dad. I was probably
*  Six years old we were in a canoe
*  it was
*  You know when you're up
*  Past midnight and we're
*  Going along it was up late that night
*  It was maybe it was probably 10 o'clock
*  But it felt like midnight because it was up late as a kid
*  And I was like literally six and we were going along the shoreline
*  Pitch black, you know hardly see anything. There's like a lot of mosquitoes up there too and I had uh
*  A floating lure. I think it was a rapala
*  Or it was I think it was a jitter bug they make that
*  Sound along the top and this bass hit it. It was a four pound bass
*  Okay, it's good. I got it in in the canoe got it in we went back to shore
*  We were at this little cottage
*  My parents had this little tiny little cabin when I was growing up
*  Uh, the neighbors came out because they heard because how excited we were we were yelling
*  Okay, got it
*  Looked at excited. We went back out and I got another one the first cast so and those kind of memories
*  Are why I do love getting out into the woods and then for the bass family those memories are equally horrific
*  And then grandpa
*  Grandpa goes out that goes where's my son? Yeah, and he and he grabs a hold of the worm, too
*  I'll catch and release now whenever I fish but uh back in the day it wasn't really sounds
*  I think that that is a fucked up thing to do. Yeah, I don't not support it
*  I don't say you shouldn't do it. It's like an alien abduction, right? Yeah, there's something
*  There's something kind of fucked up about it. It's like shooting a
*  Like a a deer and knocking it out with a slingshot to the head but then like letting it go. Yeah
*  Yeah, you're doing something really fucked up to that fish and you're making it vulnerable
*  Yeah, well
*  I get it
*  I haven't fished a lot in the last few years
*  But uh, I do my parents live on a nice lake up in quÃ©bec actually and whenever I go home to visit them
*  It's like being on vacation
*  We go out in the boat and we catch some northern pike a lot of people like barbless fly fishing
*  Never fly fish. They fly fish without a barb so they can release the fish very easily
*  So it never gets like stuck inside from yeah
*  Jesus christ the whole point of the barb is it keeps the fish on the hook
*  So then they probably they always get off all the time
*  They don't always get off you keep tension on the line. Sometimes you're okay
*  But the point is like you're you're not even pretending you want to keep that fish
*  Like you just got to you're just putting a hook in its head and bringing it out into your world
*  And then going psych and letting it go
*  It's like a there's definitely some times when you catch a fish and you hook it wrong and you feel bad because it's not a pleasant
*  Thing well in that case, it's not as much because you can get those barb with barbless hooks out easier
*  But it's just it's weird that like most of fly fishing like when they fly fish for trout
*  A lot of it is catching release a lot
*  So there's like a whole industry built around torturing these little fishies that that think they're going to get a fly
*  And it's just to give you that rush. Oh, I got one. I got one
*  This is like primal caveman rush of stripping in that line
*  Oh, I got him. I got him and bringing that fish up to the shore and thinking this is going to sustain you and your family
*  And you're like psych i'm going to burger king and you let that little fucker loose
*  You ever get those moments? I just had one moment like this where i'm sitting here and i'm looking at you
*  You know in front of the american flag on the show that i watch the show all the time and i'm sitting here
*  And it's just it's awesome, man. It's yes. Thank you. Congratulations on being a citizen. You're an american citizen
*  Exactly. I just became a u.s citizen
*  And uh, you're one of us but we don't trust you enough to be president so step
*  Step the fuck back. I was not born here. I will never be president
*  Be president unless you're born on this patch of dirt. Don't worry everybody
*  There's an imaginary line on the sand and you were born on the wrong side of it son
*  No need to worry. I will never be president of the united states. I wish I was born somewhere else
*  I wish I could never be president
*  I'd like to be born in cuba because that's going to be a lot of work when you're president
*  I don't want to be president. I'll never be president. I'm never running for any office
*  You ever never thought about getting into politics? No, that's not my place
*  My place is to talk shit and be ill-informed about many things and cause a lot of people to discuss these things because i'm ill-informed
*  I incite discussion
*  My place is not to lead. I don't think anybody's place is to be president. I really don't I think it's a ridiculous proposition
*  And I think nobody anybody's capable of handling it correctly. That's why we don't like anybody who's ever done it
*  Yeah, nobody's ever done it we like it's a it's a tough you know, you can't please everybody so
*  You can't you really can't no, it's a lose lose proposition
*  Yeah, if you want to be the guy who runs the whole thing
*  You got to please everybody and then there's all these different styles of running the whole thing, right?
*  That's one of the more interesting things about america
*  We have essentially 50 styles of running the whole thing because we have 50 states, right? So we have all these different people
*  That are in control of these different states
*  And you know we get to see how they do it like arizona lets you just carry a gun everywhere
*  Yeah, go ahead take a gun go wherever we want, you know, and california's like fuck that
*  It's gonna be harder harder to get a gun new york city is even harder
*  Different places let you have different laws in terms of like louisiana like new orleans
*  You can walk around with an open alcohol container
*  Nobody cares. Yeah walk through the street in new orleans with a beer and drinking out of that beer
*  They won't say a word. I've had some good times in new orleans. It's normal. It's normal
*  So there's different styles of running
*  Running running the whole show. Yeah, it's interesting and then you know
*  With the fact that you're under a microscope and you can't please anybody and can't believe everybody you definitely can please somebody. Yeah
*  As long as you're pleasing yourself, right?
*  Like what you would do like don't be offensive to you if you were watching would you be watching this going this corny?
*  Motherfuckers full of shit
*  Would you be watching and saying that or you would be you'd be watching going
*  But that's probably a difficult position to be in but in that position that guy's showing
*  Some character he's showing some some grace. He's showing some some compassion, you know, that's what you hope for
*  But it's you gotta the whole thing is weird
*  Anytime you're talking like this and people are listening and how many people are listening millions like that's the what does that number even mean?
*  Like how many stars are there? Does that mean anything to you anymore?
*  It's like well the universe has been around for 13 billion years like you lost me
*  I don't I don't those these numbers are too big. I don't understand what they are. Yeah, but what you can control
*  Is how you would view yourself?
*  Yeah, and you know, that's important for comedy too because there's a lot of people out there doing stand-up that don't do stand-up for themselves
*  They don't do shit. They would go to sea
*  They do things they think will work
*  They're basically like a plumber like I need this size wrench to go onto that pipe and cranker cranker cranker
*  You know as an artist, you know as some I mean, it's a it's a fucking highfalutin word for stand-up comedy
*  But it's it's kind of accurate in just in semantical terms, right?
*  So what you're trying to do is you're creating something right? But are you creating something for you?
*  Like that you would like are you creating something that you think the general public will enjoy?
*  Right, so that that comes across too like you
*  People whether they know it or not they could smell weakness
*  They smell bullshit. They smell when you're not really
*  You're not really tuned in
*  You know, like if you ever have that moment on stage where you're telling a joke
*  But you're not really thinking about it as clearly as you should be and even though you're saying the words, right people aren't laughing
*  Because they're not connected to you. You're not connected to the joke. They're not connected to you
*  So there's some weird shit going on. It's not just the words
*  There's some weird shit going on there's an understanding of your authenticity
*  That people either have or they don't have and if you don't feel authentic they're like
*  You get a certain amount of people that will pay attention
*  But after a while you're going to lose them
*  Yeah, because they know they're not and everybody's trying to be locked in everybody's trying to be authentic
*  Everybody's trying to be authentic if you're not a sociopath you're trying to be authentic, right?
*  You're trying to be better than who you were yesterday
*  You try because we all realize that this is a complicated game and no one's great at it
*  Everyone's fucking up the game of life is a mess, right?
*  It's a war zone
*  So you're trying to get better and so you want to pay attention to other people that are trying to get better and people that
*  Are legitimately tuned in people that are legitimately sensitive people that are legitimately expressing themselves in an honest way. It's very
*  Nourishing because it makes you realize it's possible and that's what we all give each other
*  We all give each other through these moments of grace and these moments of intuition these moments of inspiration of observation of
*  Sometimes you have the ability to express a thought that you didn't have yesterday
*  Like a thought will come into your head and you'll be able to express it to people and then they say it and then they
*  Then they'll say it back to you and you start talking and you realize like oh you just popped into something you just
*  This is it. That's right there. I found something
*  I found something about myself and I found something maybe you could relate to and then other people listen go
*  Oh, and they know you really did find something. They know you're not bullshitting. They listen to it and they go
*  Is he right?
*  Maybe he's not maybe I think differently and then they can maybe think their own
*  I know all this shit branches off from that but it's as long as you're authentic
*  You can be wrong. We're all going to be wrong
*  But are you authentic?
*  Mm-hmm. That's what everybody really wants people say they want honesty. They certainly want honesty
*  But honest and stupid and unaware that's not helping anybody you want authentic
*  Yeah, well I mean
*  That's what that's why we love doing this right? Yes, that's why you're saying you keep getting better
*  Yeah, the more you do stand-up you're getting more and more authentic. You're figuring out
*  Yeah, what resonates the most with you the way you think the way you perform?
*  You feel like there's going to be and we sort of touched on this but when this thing ends, I
*  Feel like
*  Stand-up comedians are going to be so happy to be back on stage and have had a break, you know, because so many
*  Comedians have been go go go go go for years. Is this the longest you've been without being on stage in your life?
*  I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure now have you ever taken?
*  Five weeks off of getting on stage
*  Yeah
*  I've taken a little time off here and there and I was trying to think of how many months was the most I did
*  There was one period of time where I did take a couple months off
*  I think it was when I was moving from Colorado to LA. I think it was around
*  2009
*  Nine, I think I probably came back from that
*  Renewed. Yeah, I think it might have been right after I filmed my uh special too. I think I filmed a special
*  And then I think I took some time off after that which I like to do sometimes just kind of reset my perspective
*  Make sure i'm not
*  I'm not bullshitting like i'm i'm talking about things i'm actually interested in so sometimes when you're working too much
*  Like one thing that does happen with stand-ups, they spend all their time either traveling or doing stand-up
*  You're not living enough and if you're not living enough, you don't see enough things
*  You have an opinion on you're thinking about your career
*  You're thinking about your set list you're thinking about a lot of shit that doesn't doesn't factor in with the you know, it's it's very
*  Very narrow-minded in a sense. So not only have all of
*  All of comedy every comedian has been forced to take a break
*  to go do something else but also to do something else during a
*  Crazy scary time where we're all being forced to think about our mortality think about the world
*  Think about the environment think about
*  And then think about your fuck-ups. Yeah, think about ex-girlfriends. Oh apologies, too
*  Yeah
*  Think about friends. Yes. Yeah, think about people that you wish were still alive
*  Think about things you could have done better times. You could have hit the brakes faster
*  Oh, yeah times you could have been driving slower times. You could have been a little less drunk time
*  Everything everybody's ever done a time you did a thing when you were a kid. You wish you had that done and want to
*  Send you to juvenile home and there's a lot of people that have made these that happen to you never happen to me
*  I'm just making up stories. I'm like Stephen King right now. Yeah, making a novel creating a character
*  But happening things that happened to you that went wrong
*  things that you did wrong, but
*  You know when you're when you're go go go all the time
*  Sometimes you get stuck in a pattern of momentum, right?
*  Where you don't have enough time to evaluate and and go am I doing the right thing?
*  I think there's a good lesson to be learned in a reset in that you can kind of if the world is crazy
*  And it's it's not anything
*  Nothing's the same now and I think we can all safely say that when the whole world shuts down
*  You're not allowed to work and everyone's supposed to stay six feet apart and everyone outside's wearing a mask when you get to a point
*  Like that you can kind of agree the world's not the same anymore, right? Right. So
*  Should you be the same should what are you doing? What the fuck are you doing with your life? What are you doing?
*  What are you doing in terms of your friends? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
*  Are you doing the right thing? Are you fucking up? Are you eating sugar all day? Like what are you doing?
*  What are you doing? Well, don't do that anymore
*  Because now you realize this is all
*  Whether it's a simulation or not
*  What's happening right now?
*  Needs to be addressed what's happening right now is if you don't have your shit together, you're more vulnerable
*  Right, so get your shit together
*  The renaissance movement. I read this on my phone two weeks ago
*  Uh, the renaissance movement occurred after the black plague
*  Everybody was forced to self-isolate and then what happened? Oh the greatest shift in thinking and art and literature in the history of
*  The world plus it probably killed a lot of people. Yeah and made room
*  Yeah, people came out of that and the whole everything changed after that and I
*  Sometimes wonder if that could happen here if we come out everything could change in a positive way for sure in a positive way
*  also the through this
*  Surviving that experience you probably feel incredibly lucky
*  So you feel fortunate so you feel like you want to get things done
*  And accomplish things and go for things that maybe you held back on before because you maybe not give a fuck as much
*  Right, so i'm gonna make i'm gonna paint a little weird now
*  i'm not gonna do it the way that they've always been doing the painting and i'm gonna like i'm gonna
*  I don't know a lot about painting but i'm gonna make it i'm gonna make the painting weird now, you know
*  Yeah, oh wait, that's weird. That's a weird way of painting. Hey, man. I fucking survived
*  I don't give a fuck anymore man, dude the black plague. Yeah, you paying attention bitch about the fucking black. I sat my fucking
*  you know
*  Wherever they lived back then drinking homemade wine. Yeah banging boys. That's what they did. I don't know
*  I don't know. There's a lot of that. I'm sure some of that was going on
*  Yeah, it's these moments of history where things shift and change
*  I mean clearly if you go back to as far as we're aware of
*  You know go back to uh, you know
*  1100 ad
*  Pick a spot pick a year now compare that to now. Well, we're definitely better at life now, right?
*  Why did we get better at life? Because there was trials and errors just like you get better as a human
*  We get better at life
*  You know what bothers me man? This bothered me. We were just just just discussing this
*  I was like, do you I wonder when I see a civilization like china that's like completely in control of their citizens
*  And it's so old it's such an old civilization like as time goes on
*  If a civilization lasts a long long time
*  Does it get just tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter control?
*  And is that what the magic of america is what the magic of america is is that it's only been around for 300 years
*  Not even so like is that the thing that you have to have a young fresh movement of freedom?
*  And then eventually human nature sort of fucking chokes it and gets in a rear naked puts it to sleep
*  Is that what happens is that over time?
*  Life and nature human nature and greed is basically like a jujitsu black belt
*  You could defend it as you could defend it for a little while
*  But eventually it's going to put the choke on you
*  Is that what it is because it seems like all these older civilizations when the oldest ones that we're aware of are run by military dictators
*  The old ones is that because they've always been like that because they were like that thousands of years ago
*  And they're like that still now they never had a chance to make that clean break
*  Or is it because as civilizations go on if as long as power is maintained
*  There's no overthrow of it through this whole cycle
*  They always get to a point where they just try to control the citizens
*  It's just too difficult and I want all the money and I want all the bitches and i'm gonna shoot the bombs
*  And i'm gonna control the people and I want all the food the people are used to it and they accept it
*  Let them eat ice cream. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It's weird. You know, I I I went to
*  I went to china for the first time in my life one year ago
*  Okay
*  Strangely enough, uh, i've never been there before
*  Another thing that happened a year earlier that it's perfect for your life one year ago
*  I did a show in hong kong and i did a show in shanghai with your show and the cancer
*  And the thing that I find interesting about china though is having had never been there before hong kong. Of course, it's different, right?
*  You know, it's it's you know, british colony and it's very but you shanghai same thing
*  That was the only part of
*  communist china that I went to shanghai, right and you get there and
*  They got louis vuitton store
*  Everybody's walking around shopping you drive from the airport. I'm thinking it's going to be some
*  Driving from the airport. There's big mansions. I'm like, well, I thought I you know, I'm crazy rich asians
*  I was like why yeah exactly and i'm like, well, I thought I was saying to the guy that picked me up the airport
*  I'm saying well, I thought this was a
*  Communist how come how come they have
*  Big mansions. He's all it's not really the way it works. And it's just sort of uh, it's just sort of
*  The economic system is not communist is I know I forgot again how explained it to me
*  but you sort of got over there and you realize like
*  It didn't seem a whole lot different to be honest with you. I went to a mall, you know
*  They had one of the pianos in the mall anybody can play, you know
*  I sat down and played people came around, you know, like just the same kind of dumb shit that they got here
*  you know and
*  You know, so I came back from that thinking okay. Well, I mean obviously I know it's a lot different but
*  We're also also
*  So the same too. It's very strange, you know, so I don't know
*  Have you have you been to china or it's i've been to taiwan never been to china. Yeah
*  that's the thing about doing when we two are doing stand-up is that it's that thing that kind of
*  Bothers you sometimes when you go somewhere you've never been before and you get there and it's exactly the same
*  Where's it ever been exactly the same?
*  Well, it's like I remember the first time I went to australia
*  And i thought australia is exactly the same. Well, you got there. I was like that within five minutes
*  I went to a starbucks
*  And oh I did a uso tour that that's a bad example. A better example is I went to a uso tour
*  So i'm thinking i'm going to the middle east. We got to barrain
*  We landed in a barrain went to the marriott
*  Okay
*  And then we said can we take a walk? You can take a walk. We took a walk
*  There was a dairy queen. I ended up getting kentucky fried chicken
*  I had some kentucky fried chicken in barrain after i've just flown to the other side of the world and I was thinking this is
*  Going to be so different and it wasn't wasn't that much different. It sounds like you were at a military base
*  So well in barrain we were staying at a marriott and then we went into kuwait and then we went into
*  So where'd you get the kentucky fried chicken when you're in town or was that was in town in barrain?
*  We weren't on the base in barrain. We were in town. It was uh, whatever the city is in barrain
*  It's almost to me
*  More exciting that when you would go to a place like that already be corrupted by mcdonald's. There's something
*  There's something ridiculously thrilling. Look, I would love to land somewhere. Don't get me wrong
*  I would love to land somewhere and deal only with the authentic culture
*  But there's also something kind of weird about flying for 18 hours and landing in some country and ordering a big mac
*  And and seeing it being served up by people who live in this strange land different different than you
*  You know grew up in a different environment different culture different language different alphabet
*  Here you are eating a quarter pounder in the same place. It's like there's something about it
*  that
*  I like
*  When things don't make any sense. I like when things are haywire
*  I like when you're like what in the fuck have you done?
*  There's something about that that I like and I like a burger king in the middle of thailand
*  I like it. Yeah, I don't want to eat there. I don't want to eat there
*  but there's part of me that's like the ridiculous folly of humans and their decision making and and and
*  And what we do and what we don't do
*  I'm thrilled by it
*  Yeah
*  I'm thrilled by ridiculous videos of dudes getting on a slip and slide trying to ride a fucking beer keg
*  Down the side of a hill when you know, it's gonna go wrong
*  I'm thrilled by that
*  You know, and this is part of me that i'm trying to really suppress
*  That i'm not thrilled by people dying from this virus. I'm not thrilled by you if you feel ill
*  I'm not thrilled by any of that. I'm not thrilled by anybody's suffering, but i'm thrilled by chaos
*  i'm thrilled by the fact that this whole system gets thrown into a fucking
*  Just a blender and spun around and no one knows what's going to get spit out and a lot of these people
*  They're getting you're getting really clearly revealed. They're frauds
*  These people that are in positions of leadership or bizarre human beings that don't even live in reality
*  I was watching nancy apollosi trying to dance her way out of saying that in february
*  She was telling people to go to chinatown hang out. Have a good time. Don't worry about it. Like like
*  You were doing the same thing. You're accusing the president of doing you're accusing trump of not warning people
*  Well, you didn't warn anybody either
*  Everyone's playing gotcha with this nobody saw what the fuck was coming
*  Like I said the fucking world health organization in a tweet was saying it can't be transmitted from person to person
*  No one knew so this is all this chaos of all these people getting revealed
*  I like it
*  Yeah, I like it. There's part of it that I like I enjoy because I think that one one thing that we have above
*  All the people that live before us is that we have more access to information
*  We see the flaws better we see the flaws better whereas before we were lied to and bullshit it now you can see it better
*  It doesn't mean those flaws aren't going to exist, but those people are going to have to be they're going to have to be authentic
*  They're not authentic right now
*  Like when you see someone the record will show
*  That I was there in chinatown to tell people to not be racist
*  The record will show you can't do that anymore. You can't do that anymore. We demand you be authentic
*  And if you made a mistake
*  Like that like in february look man if you were hanging out with me in february we were barbecuing
*  I'll be like it's probably the flu people are gonna get sick. They're gonna die, but i'm not a fucking expert
*  Okay, i'm not a politician and if I said that i'd be like man was I wrong?
*  Here's why I thought that here's what I wouldn't say the record will show
*  The reason why I said that is I want you to not be racist to chinese people
*  Like if you believe that like this is like some intricate plot
*  To that nancy pelosi had to sort of stop racism against chinese people like nonsense
*  Right you were talking shit and the world changed and it was the same as like was it the secretary of health in new york city
*  Who was it that was telling people to go out take the subway?
*  I forget who it was but there was this lady like she made a bad call
*  Right, but nobody knew the world health organizations telling people it can't be transmitted from person to person at one point in time
*  No one knew it's a new thing. You know where mistakes made, of course, they're made
*  This is who's the perfect person in real time in the middle of a fucking pandemic crisis
*  That person doesn't exist. They don't have access to the information to make perfect decisions
*  You have to have all the information was some of it ignored. Yeah, because it was conflicting information
*  So it has to be sifted through right is hydroxychloroquine turns out that stuff kills more people than not using it
*  Oops. Yeah, whoops. That's not good. But then there's some other stuff. What is the new stuff that the the nurse was telling us about?
*  rams
*  Yeah, rams
*  And by the way, I feel good about I feel good about getting that antibody test. Yes, it's good to know
*  It's interesting. Well, I feel good about that and I really feel good about I guess it was what we're saying
*  It was the ucla study that was saying that it has a much smaller
*  rate of mortality than was
*  Initially thought so early antibody testing we talked about this
*  So wait, how did they determine that is it because because more people are being tested and yes fewer people are no
*  But this is how they do it as they are testing people they're realizing far more people have had the virus
*  And survived from the antibody tests from the antibody test not just far more but on a magnitude of you know, whatever
*  They thought it was like 2 000. It turns out it's like 400 000 or they thought it was 20 000
*  And it's 400 000 is the most and uh through that they've determined it has a much lower
*  Fatality rate than they initially anticipated they were they were thinking it was going to be like five percent ten percent fatality rate
*  It's like one half of one percent, but that doesn't mean it's not dangerous
*  It just means that it's not as dangerous as the worst case scenario could have been like if it was like the h1n1
*  Which I think some crazy number h1n1 a billion infected I think but no, I mean as far as fatality rate
*  For some for certain people's a very high rate of fatality. This was not as bad as that, but they didn't know
*  They didn't know they didn't do the social distancing with h1n1. They didn't everyone didn't go we didn't do this whole shutdown
*  So then you go. Well, maybe if we hadn't done the shutdown there would have been way worse
*  I don't know what the steps were. This was during the obama administration. I think it was uh, 2009 burke crusher thinks he had it
*  Said he felt worse than he's ever felt in his life. I have a friend who in december
*  You know had the worst flu we ever had it was a weird flu with a few friends who've had that
*  You know, this has been around longer than we know. I mean, they said the first case was in january that was in december
*  I don't know like who knows but
*  Well, you know, I mean you got to take care of your immune system folks
*  This is number one. You got to shore up the troops take care of the troops
*  They're going to fight the war for you
*  If you have an army and your army is malfed and you're feeding them junk food and bullshit and you're
*  Pumping them full of cigarettes you expect them to fight
*  With all they have what they have is going to be less
*  Okay, doesn't mean they're not going to fight to the death or whatever
*  But what they have is going to be less than if you took that army and fed them healthy food and gave them
*  Eight hours rest a night and you know and taught them how to meditate and kept stress low like legitimately
*  And that's how you have to think about your immune system the same way you would think about an army
*  Think about your immune system is this is going to be what protects you
*  From the invaders and the invaders are invisible viruses and they exist and they've always existed and we know it
*  This is not a rumor. This is not alchemy. This is not nonsense. This is a fucking scientific fact
*  And even knowing that scientific fact
*  Beautifully intelligent people that are some of the most creative and innovative people the world has ever known
*  Still ignore their own physical health
*  Because they don't think of it as a primary concern. They think of it as a frivolous
*  egocentric
*  Narcissistic endeavor to look good and work out and what are you gonna wear?
*  Fucking tank tops and flex your guns get the fuck out of here. I'm doing research
*  But we all need to take care of our bodies
*  This is something that needs to be like it should be like brushing your goddamn teeth. Did your teeth fall out of your head?
*  Well, hey stupid, you should have brushed your fucking teeth. All right. Did your body start falling apart? Yeah. Hey stupid
*  Did you do your exercises every day? You didn't you don't exercise every day. I can't help you. You're not helping yourself
*  Exercise doesn't mean you have to be mr. Olympia means you should be doing jump rope or push-ups or whatever
*  You're physical physically you can if you have some limitations
*  Whatever you can withstand walk around your block with ankle weights on do something fucking do something man. Eat right do it
*  So you have such a huge responsibility here, you know that obviously but but because you have so many people watching this show
*  Okay, and trying to freak me out Tom Green a little bit possible. It's all your responsible
*  For me doing this. How about that?
*  Ultimately you I'm like your kid
*  Yeah, you know for Patrice used to say that about comedians that like imitated him. They're my babies
*  Patrice you say like like David tells got a lot of babies out there because a lot of people imitating David tell
*  But you have a lot of babies. I'm one of your babies. How about that?
*  That's very nice of you to say I that's hilarious
*  The baby of you and
*  Howard's well, you know Howard Stern and Anthony got together in a gangbang with Terrence McKenna
*  I'm all your babies
*  I'm all your babies that is very kind of you to say I'm sitting here on your incredible show with everybody is
*  riveted by your show and
*  When you say something it matters which is different than when you do a show on your you know
*  I do a podcast now, you know, I got a few people listening, but it's not like it doesn't matter, right?
*  That's a responsibility. So it's responsibility the people listening, but you're when you say something here it will affect
*  The the entire society you have people now who don't believe in stay home order. They're out
*  Well, they should they should they should until
*  The actual scientific experts tell them that they should go out but here's the thing right
*  Who are the experts and are they different in different states?
*  And I think that's one of the benefits of having 50 states when I was talking about the different styles of
*  Living Arizona lets you have a gun just carry it on your hip, right? You can't do that in San Francisco, right?
*  Everyone there's different styles of living
*  Let's find out what different styles are right way to reopen the world. We know the world's got to be reopened
*  Okay, we're not gonna just stay in our house forever. We're gonna run out of food
*  We have to do things right? So do we have to do things after the vaccination and can our society survive that?
*  Do you know how many people are committing suicide right now? My friend of mine was I heard said Nick Swartz and I said yesterday
*  Sorry, Nick
*  He told me he was talking to this sheriff and the sheriff said they used to deal with one suicide a week now
*  They're doing five a day
*  This is something that needs to be factored in right other thing. There's a there's a Bloomberg
*  There was an article that was written that we're talking about the drop in the economy
*  equivalent to a loss of a certain number of lives and that every time the economy drops a certain percentage
*  Right equal to X amount of lives
*  We might get to a place where it's conceivable that more lives are lost because of the ensuing depression and economic shutdown
*  Would have been lost if we didn't open up if we didn't close down anything and we just let everybody get sick
*  It's a it is a complicated thing and this is one thing that we have to really rely on the people that are supposed to
*  Be in power to address
*  Accurately and honestly no one knows the right way to do this
*  there's some real good protocols that are in place for for keeping people healthy and
*  Protecting each other and staying away from each other as much as possible and wiping thing down and using hand sanitizer and stopping the spread
*  Yes for sure, but no one knows how to get this thing started again. No one knows what's gonna happen
*  No, no one knows what the risks are we gonna wait and in the meantime
*  What about the other diseases that are still around?
*  What about the colds and the flus and what about all that stuff that all stuff that you know?
*  It kills more people than any of these things
*  Including COVID-19 projections heart attacks. Yeah heart attacks killing people left and right
*  How come there's no like there's no alarms to stop people from dying of heart attacks
*  Heart disease was number one
*  Like the flu and all these other things that we're all terrified of this is lack of of of
*  No, first of all lack of information not knowing I mean
*  Lack of you don't know if you can prevent this right cannot you can't you know, you know, you've eat well
*  Look after yourself you be less likely to have a heart attack
*  But you don't know if you can breathe can't breathe in a heart attack
*  Well, and then the heart attack thing is all dependent upon your genetics as well
*  There's some people that have a predisposition to heart attacks, but what you know, like again, I was I guess I asked this already
*  But like that's a lot of pressure Joe
*  I mean because if you say something wrong and it's sending people so you must do I'm just kind of curious how much time
*  You do spend researching because you know, you know so much information
*  99% of the time you have Jamie Google things to correct me in midstream
*  so is it instinct is it are you able to see sort of the you know, the the truth through the bullshit and then you kind of
*  Cuz cuz I mean you sort it out in real time cuz you're walking a very you're walking a very fine line
*  I think you're walking it incredibly well and in a way that many many many great many people are not right
*  They choose it seems like we're in this world now or because everything's so polarized
*  Oh, I've got to choose to say this because that's what everyone's saying and they're just kind of saying it because everyone's saying it
*  Where's you?
*  definitely straddle that
*  line in a way that to me seems incredibly
*  Astute but also must be
*  Some pressure to make sure that you're right not until you start telling me about it
*  Now I'm thinking about freaking out Tom green, you know, well cuz you could easily be that you could easily be
*  Hey, you should this is bullshit
*  I told him he was my daddy and now he's being he's being like
*  Now he's he's basically giving me the hard conversation
*  I'm curious cuz it's fascinating to me. Thank you
*  Yeah, how do you how do you make those determinations?
*  Cuz a lot of people have made mistakes right now a lot of commentators have made mistakes who have said things
*  I make mistakes too. If you're doing this 1500 whatever the fuck shows plus fight companions and shit
*  I don't know Jerry MMA shows is another 50 of those at least right 100 Jesus. We're living in a world now
*  I make a lot of mistakes. They've already done that. That's okay. Go ahead. Keep going. Keep do it again
*  it's this like the the number the vast number of
*  Interactions that most people have with each other are positive, right?
*  Most of the otherwise the world would be a war zone. Most of the time you deal people like hey, how you doing?
*  Hey, what's up? Hey this the same thing as podcast the vast majority of the stuff you do is gonna be good
*  There's gonna be moments where though some guy you were taking a left turn and he honked to you and you said fuck you
*  And he said no fuck you and like that guy's got a bad opinion you you got a bad opinion him
*  That's gonna happen too. Well, that's the same in podcasts
*  It's gonna be these moments where things just just fall apart or go off the rails. It's got accept it
*  It is what it is. And how do you decide to not?
*  And I don't feel like you do have an agenda to change or change things in it any sort of
*  Premeditated direction you just you're trying to be honest. People don't want because everyone has an agenda, right?
*  Nancy Pelosi you say this about whoever on right left right left. They got an agenda. Oh, I can't say this
*  Even though I believe it
*  Because that's not gonna work with the narrative right that I'm that seems crazy. I
*  Don't have an agenda. Yeah. Yeah, I can tell you just want to be real
*  Well, I just I wanted I just want to be able to talk to friends about stuff that's actually happening. That's it
*  Yeah, but if you have an it like the agenda if I have an agenda at all is I want people to do better
*  Me included. I mean there's one of the things that I like to do. Is that possible at this point? Sure for sure
*  Stand up with archery. Yeah, I'm get better at playing pool tomorrow practice. Yeah, maybe get better at pool
*  Maybe I'm doing like Muay Thai doing martial arts here
*  Like the more you do it the more you think about how you're doing it and more you realize like oh
*  There's like a lot of stuff I could learn here. Uh-huh. That's what I want people to do
*  I want people to find things and and try to get better at them doesn't mean try to be the best doesn't mean be obsessed
*  With it. There's something that you get out of trying to be better
*  And whether it's better physically like if you choose just like to
*  Develop a better like people like look down at bodybuilding a lot of people look down at bodybuilding. They're all fucking meatheads
*  Okay, that's great some the sometimes people fit the stereotype
*  But there's kind of something cool about someone say I'm gonna turn my body into a work of art
*  I'm gonna develop a freakish physique where I look like the Incredible Hulk in a comic book
*  Yeah, and I'm just gonna be walking around everywhere with cutoff shirts on and and
*  You what you doing is kind of weird, but it's it's kind of interesting too
*  We just decide that it's stupid because we don't do it
*  You decide that it's stupid because I don't want to be 320 pounds with 28 inch arms and fucking walking around
*  But some people do and there's kind of something interesting about watching someone do that to their body something weird about it
*  It's a weird pursuit at what point does it cross that line with bodybuilding?
*  What you know, you're healthy you're working out you're getting yeah, you know clearly I work out
*  No, but you're working out you're you're all of a sudden you starting to go. Hey, I'm getting close to that line where mm-hmm
*  I remember Joe Piscopo not I loved Joe Piscopo
*  I got real jacked I love like what I was you know in the eighth grade and Johnny dangerously came out
*  You know you're fire-racking ice holes and it was like he was the funniest thing to me
*  I loved that was a great movie Johnny dangerously. I forgot about Johnny dangerously reference. That's a
*  Was a fun movie in the hell I remember in the eighth grade we were coming in you
*  Far-ranging ice holes and we thought it was so hilarious cuz we're swearing but we're not really swearing
*  But then all of a sudden he became Arnold Schwarzenegger and that was like there was a decision that got made there at that point
*  I'm just curious cuz you I'm not really around a lot of the the I don't go to the gym
*  I don't know if you work out at home. I don't know if you could tell but I don't work out at home. I
*  Walk I walk a lot. She's just trying to stay alive pretty much. Yeah, you like to be geez. Yeah pretty much. Yeah
*  I go, you know when I'm when I'm when I'm on the road and there's a gym in the hotel
*  Right great song. Yeah, great song. Maybe once a month. I'll go to the gym once a month a good number
*  It's better than zero times a month once a month on the road. It's not not the worst thing
*  Yeah, zero times a month is bad, but I walk a lot and I touch my toes. I stretch
*  dangerous living dangerous
*  Yeah, you're alive. I watch my more than I watch my what? Yeah, no, I should rain or you got some kind
*  I need more exercise once you get a trainer once all this balls over yes some dude to come over in a hazmat
*  Shoot. Yes show you how to do burpees. I just worried I
*  Don't even know what a burpee is. It's a fun exercise you you stand there you jump up, right?
*  You drop okay, you do a push up back to your feet jump up and you do that's one
*  That's one revolution and you keep going any time I do any sort of organized exercise. I feel great
*  Why don't you do it more often? I need to it's a weird thing. It's like I'm on that's what I'm talking about
*  it's like this weird sort of you know, you got to do it, but I
*  often make the decision like
*  Cuz I I made this decision
*  Every time I go to a new hotel and I'm on the road. I say this weekend
*  I'm gonna work out I pack my gym clothes
*  I put them in the thing I said Kate tomorrow morning when I get up
*  I'm gonna go to the gym and I get up in the morning and then I just like go get lunch you brush your teeth
*  Do you take a shit I do the gym I do just go to the gym
*  Yeah, it's like don't give yourself an out. The problem is you give yourself an out. Yeah, you can't give yourself an out
*  Why do I do that though? It's a Steven Pressfield wrote about it in the war of art
*  Yeah, it's a great book. If you haven't read it the war of arts a real small book
*  I used to have a stack of a nice to hand them out to guests. He talks about
*  This thing that we all have everyone has not just me. I mean everybody that does anything has and it's like this
*  voice in your head that wants you to do nothing
*  This voice in your head and he calls it resistance
*  Yeah
*  And he talks about this resistance that is in your head and that you have to decide that you are a professional
*  this is what a professional does a professional goes to work and
*  They they they give in to the muse
*  Okay, the concept of the muse whether or not it's real but the concept of the muse is
*  You settle in and receive creativity
*  Almost like as a divine gift from this magical entity the muse now whether or not it's real is not important
*  What's important is it is if you treat it as if it's real it does work
*  And what works is if you dedicate your time and your focus like realistically with a professional
*  Disciplined effort to creativity you show up every day like a professional
*  Like a professional
*  But you show up to be creative if you just do it on a regular basis ideas will come to you
*  Where are these ideas coming from?
*  well his his concept was to think of it as you are a
*  Professional and you're getting these ideas from the muse and this is what you do you show up and you do the work you focus
*  On it and these ideas will come to you
*  And that's really true if you really stop and think about it if you write something whether it's the most brilliant thing you've ever written
*  Or whether you're not good at editing and it turns out to be dogshit
*  You're still it's where is that coming from man?
*  You're just sitting down in front of your laptop and these thoughts are coming to you and all of a sudden you're talking about a kid
*  Who's riding a bike and he gets attacked by a werewolf like where the fuck is this coming from if it's not?
*  Coming from the muse. Where is it coming from? Well? It's coming from my creativity, okay?
*  Do you know how to access your creativity like you can blink no you don't you do?
*  Access your activity like you can lick something or perform any sort of physical functions repeatable. No you don't it's a non repeatable thing
*  Treat it like it's magic
*  But treat it like you're a professional and you show up to engage with the magic so every day at the same time
*  You sit down in front of your keyboard and you start working and just put in the work put in the work and force yourself
*  To do it you force it like a muscle like the same muscle that you develop when you go running every day
*  And then you get to the point well like seven days in you start fucking feeling good running
*  Right so you start to feel like you're good at it. You start feeling like you're getting better
*  Yeah, because you're putting in the time. I think that's what it is so with because I'm very focused on so many things in my life
*  But for some reason I think I'm thinking I'm figuring it out now because you explained it to me
*  Because when I go to the gym
*  I feel like I'm not good at it, and I feel self-conscious about it of course
*  I feel like oh, I don't know what I'm doing are people looking at me
*  I don't know how the way that inputs bad inputs right and then you don't like it right so then you don't want to do it
*  Again, and then you next to some goddamn Calvin Klein model with his shirt off right and he looks amazing like shit
*  Yeah, yeah, and he's he's jacked and he's posing
*  He's been working out for 12 years straight never took it a day off
*  You see those side muscles
*  Yeah, make me feel bad about myself
*  I'm feeling bad about myself, and I don't want if I don't like that feeling so I'd rather just you know
*  I do it, but I I do think that you that yeah
*  I guess getting a trainer would help because you have somebody to talk to
*  Not only know you're not making mistake because they're telling you what to do
*  They're telling you not only they're telling you what to do
*  But they're gonna chart progress and they're gonna challenge you like a good trainer is look
*  It's a very valuable resource like if you can afford a trainer if you can't there's a lot of great resources online on YouTube
*  man YouTube is
*  for someone who wants to learn
*  Exercise routines and wants to learn like a bodyweight routine that they can do just in their living room
*  There's never been a better time to be quarantined
*  You don't have to pay for a gym membership
*  And this is gonna a lot of people gonna realize like hey if I have a fucking chin-up bar in my house and one kettlebell
*  I don't need to I don't need a gym membership. I got gravity boots for stretching my back out
*  I can do sit-ups on that thing. I could do leg lifts
*  I can do a million different things with kettlebells literally a million more gravity boots
*  Yeah, gravity boots man you hang from your ankles. Okay, you never done that no. Oh my god
*  It feels so good
*  How often do you do that I have a thing called
*  It's a teeter and it straps onto your ankles and now you don't have to have the gravity boots anymore
*  It's you're on a like a plank and it tilts you upside down. You can try it right out here
*  We have it out here in the studio
*  That I like even better it's called the decks and you hang from your waist
*  It locks you in
*  Curl can't imagine having gravity boots at home right now by myself just hanging upside down it the decks is better for you
*  Because the decks you don't have to hang you just you just put your legs in this thing
*  Don't you think that one feels the best?
*  Yeah, you cuz Jamie you had some back problems when you fell Jamie Jamie fell on the hoverboard. I'm sorry
*  I'm laughing but he's over it. Those hoverboards are fucking dangerous man. Those things you stand on
*  Yeah, yeah, well Jamie was learning out here and we have concrete floors
*  Jamie whoa those are hard up. Yeah, I was playing with my camera while I was doing I was doing some shit
*  You shouldn't do you shouldn't do that
*  You should concentrate entirely on what you're doing you want to be distracted when you learn and because you start feeling like I remember
*  The first time I did it at the comic store almost fell but my friend Tate was there Tate the gorilla
*  Fletcher he he had a hold of me like when I was on this thing. I was like, oh my god
*  How does anybody ever get good at this? Like this is so crazy. I'm gonna die and then five minutes later. I was like
*  It's like a really quick thing to learn tried one once and I skateboarded my whole life and that's still it's a completely counterintuitive
*  Sort of balancing thing. Yeah. Well James fucked it. He might have broken his ass bone. Didn't you think you broke your ass?
*  I probably did. Oh, yeah, it took about a year and a half to you. Oh, yeah
*  He was talking about there was a kind of pain that he had then we saw it on a video
*  That was like a similar injury. Well, Zach Bitter was in here. That's right. That's right
*  Doctors and they couldn't figure it out. That's right
*  It was Zach Bitter who is the world record holder for a 20 or well for a 100 mile run
*  He did a hundred miles in 11 hours and 40 something minutes
*  Is that what it is, which is the most bonkers thing I've ever fucking heard in my life
*  And then he ran a few miles after that. Wait, what did he do? Sorry? He ran
*  100 miles in a row in 11 hours and 40 something minutes ran a hundred miles in a track
*  Oh in a track. It's sorry. Just went circles. Yeah for 11 hours. Yes distance runner Zach Bitter shout out to Zach
*  He's a fucking savage. So that's the fastest you could run a hundred miles. Oh, I'm sorry
*  11 hours 19 minutes. So that's the record for 40 minutes
*  It's amazing that measuring that like how many people have ever even tried that a lot to run a hundred miles
*  Yeah, because the four-minute mile was a big thing. He did it in a hundred mile record though
*  That's a big commitment to break that record crazy
*  11 hours 19 minutes to go a hundred miles this fucking bonkers. That's bonkers Wow
*  Would it I wonder if he would have gotten a hundred miles in the same time if he'd just been running on the street
*  Well, I'll pop obviously now it all depends on whether or not it was totally flat
*  There's a lot of factors involved when you're running that long like those really savage guys like my friend Cameron Haynes
*  He runs that a Moab 240 through the Moab Mountains. It's 240 miles
*  Yeah through the Moab like if you ever seen that terrain, it's chaos man. I've heard of the Moab. Where's that again?
*  It's in Utah, Utah, right? Okay pull up the images from the Moab 240. So this is a whole different thing
*  So this is not just 240 miles, but this is 240 miles
*  I love that we're pulling up videos by the way, like let's look at some videos because
*  That's got to be a hilarious thing to be able to have the ability to do that
*  by the way to wake up in the morning and say I'm just gonna go outside and then you know, you
*  Know, you know 11 hours later, you're in Connecticut. Yeah
*  right
*  So this is this is the this is the footage from the race
*  So these folks are running all through the night with fucking headlamps on in the mountains
*  Mmm, it's all like dirt roads and shit weird trails and
*  There's I don't know how many people were in the race, but it's
*  240 fucking miles
*  Man
*  It's amazing the
*  Obscure things that people decide to do right? I mean that to me seems obscure. I'm sure it's probably very big thing
*  but I just watched the
*  movie about the the
*  Free free free climbing movie that's playing on the plane, but the guy that climbed Alex Honnold. Yeah
*  Yeah, he's been on here. I'm sure yes. He has
*  Wow, I know it's like to focus on something that I
*  Mean how many people have he's the only person that had done that is he or the fastest to have done it or I think
*  He's the only person who did it without ropes. Yeah. Yeah to so does to see somebody that decides
*  Like I said earlier, we're gonna make tents. I want to make tents. I want to climb that
*  Yeah, you get to meet so many people like that. Yeah, that must be fun. Well, it's it's very important
*  for me as a
*  Person who's trying to figure people out is to be able to see this insane spectrum of exceptional people, right?
*  I have to see someone like Alex Honnold. He's a really fascinating guy. Yeah, very fascinating guy because he's really smart
*  He's really tuned in he's really mellow. He's got hands like sausages, right? Yeah, this month
*  I look like it like
*  Changed they've had his hands have evolved or something. I mean these fucking
*  The surfaces of these insane rocks, yeah, did he was telling us a story in the podcast of one time
*  He was halfway up the side of this fucking mountain. He realized he didn't bring his chalk with him
*  So he found some other climbers that were on their way up that were on ropes
*  And he said hey do you think I can borrow some chalk and they gave this guy goes?
*  Yeah, I have an extra bag here. Take it. So he's fucking a thousand feet up
*  Just hang it on finding other people were connected to the ropes and they give him a bag of stories over
*  He leaves it at the top of the mountain because he passes. Yeah, cuz he's and he's not using any ropes
*  Yeah, fucking Christ, man
*  Did you see this video where Jared Leto was climbing with Alex recently it's like about March
*  Oh, I heard about did he fall down or something? He came very close. Oh shit. This is the don't show me
*  Don't show me. I'll freak out
*  Wow my god, that's terrible, that's not good. Yeah, whoo. Holy shit, dude
*  Fuck all that. Look, I know it's I jumped out of an airplane with Jared Leto once
*  Did you really know what you're a little?
*  Well, it was we went to Paris, California
*  Together with a group of people and I had always said I am never going to jump out of an airplane
*  That was always my thing that I said my whole life never gonna jump out of an airplane
*  Never gonna go parachuting you ever done parachuting. No exactly. I was I feel the same way
*  But I still ended up doing it because we drove out there
*  together
*  Group of people and I realized on the drive that I was the only person that wasn't jumping out of the airplane
*  Oh Jesus and for whatever reason my competitive spirit got the best of me
*  I said, there's no way I'm gonna be the one that didn't jump out of the airplane on the way back
*  so we suited up and
*  I'd just done that movie Charlie's Angels
*  Okay, and the stunt there was a lot of parachuting in it and the stunt coordinators from that movie
*  Were taking the cast out to jump out if they wanted to so I went and Jared Leto was there and
*  you know
*  my friends were there and
*  And I did it I did it and I didn't regret it, but I'll never do it again. It was amazing
*  It was exciting. It was tandem. You know, you have a guy you're strapped onto a guy
*  Guys on your back, right guys on your boy. He's on your back. He's on your back. Yeah, he's on your back
*  He's on your back
*  You go and that the way the craziest thing is you go and you flip you flip and then immediately you see the plane
*  The plane is filling your peripheral vision and then immediately the plane goes from bro
*  Get small. Oh my you realize Wow
*  That perfectly good airplane as they say that perfectly good airplane is getting a lot further away
*  And then you're and now the weirdest part about it was this was 20 years ago now, but or 18 or whatever
*  You're now you're doing this right and you kind of realize
*  Hey, we've got some sort of control because there's another guy over there
*  he's like kind of far away and all of a sudden like you lean into it and you're
*  You fly up to him like Superman
*  Now you're this far away this far away. He's got video camera on his head
*  I don't know where the tape is and you're looking at each other and
*  It's amazing and exciting and then the thing that was weird about is then you pull the chute or the guy on your back
*  pulls the chute and
*  Now you're hanging from ropes. You're here. You're no shoots open and you would think that would be the time where it's
*  You can relax but to me the one time I've done it talking about parachuting like I know about it the one time
*  I've done it 18 years ago
*  That's the scariest moment because now you're sort of
*  Realizing that the only thing preventing you and you're looking at your feet
*  Now you're looking at your feet hanging below you and you're feeling these ropes
*  You're holding and so I'm holding the ropes going these ropes give like
*  Nothing nothing between me and it was it was amazing experience huge adrenaline rush
*  We'll never do it again because now at least I can say I have done it
*  right, even though I didn't ever want to have to be able to say that now that I have said it there's no reason to
*  do it again, but
*  You know, who knows? Maybe I will end up doing it. You should jump
*  You should jump out of an air. I can't believe you haven't actually I'm surprised you haven't I think you got a contact high son
*  Yeah, I think you should do it I think you would I think you would dig it if I lived yeah
*  Yeah, you would seems fun. You go with one of those. I'm not into thrills like that
*  Like you get your adrenaline from watch this is a strange way to get a thrill
*  I'm not trying to knock anybody who does it but it's a strange way to get a thrill. Let's pretend we're dying. Oh
*  Oh
*  We're not dying but now we're hanging yeah, yeah on our way down. Oh, yeah, isn't it pretty?
*  Yeah, I get it I get it but I don't I don't think I need that in my life no
*  Don't that's what I always said to
*  It's not necessary. I ended up being you know, whenever you're gonna get in a situation where you end up going out to a
*  parachuting thing with a bunch of people unless
*  you know your
*  You know in a relationship and the person is going and you go with them because they're going and then all of a sudden
*  You're there and you're going like I'm not gonna be there
*  The chicken shit. Yeah, you got to do what you got to do safe face. Yeah
*  Almost die. Yeah, save face people do die
*  You know what's fucked up about it is that's one of those things that you kind of you do it and you think like oh
*  I'm gonna be okay and then one time maybe you're not and
*  that's all it takes one of
*  I
*  Think was was it red bands dad his friend worked with a lady
*  Was it a lady that was really in the skydiving?
*  She was always trying to get him to do it and then one day he showed up at work and she wasn't at her desk
*  mmm, and
*  So what happened? Oh, she died. Yeah
*  Yeah died skydiving
*  Fuck yeah all that
*  Fuck all that dude
*  Yeah, I'm not dying
*  It's kind of a predictable
*  It's like could have anticipated that you know, yeah, it's enough enough enough
*  It's kind of how I feel about the that's why I've been staying home, you know, yeah for the whole world
*  We just need we need to lock in this is gonna this is gonna be the the honey pot that gets us to enter the virtual
*  Reality, this is gonna be the honey pot. Like do you want to deal with viruses? There's no viruses in this world
*  Your soul carry on so what about even know what about what Edward Snowden I believe I
*  researched this by heard he was saying that this is sort of a an attempt to get us to
*  Get implanted with you know, biological testing have our phones set up more to follow us
*  Is this you know, is there any sort of?
*  Time something this is a reality of human nature
*  By the way with Snowden, thank you. He's a brilliant guy any time
*  There's an opening for people to take advantage of that opening
*  Anytime there's a moment that happens where there's some scrambling and maybe they can gather up more power
*  Maybe they can gather up more surveillance tools
*  Maybe they can make it easier to do things that they'd like to do that have nothing to do like the Patriot Act
*  They think there's a lot of stuff for the Patriot Act that had nothing to do with terrorism
*  You know, they just decided let's add some stuff in let's control these motherfuckers
*  they always want to control people P it's hard to control people and as the
*  Population gets bigger and as time goes on they slowly give in to this idea controlling people more and more
*  so they're gonna definitely use this as a
*  Way to ensure that you know, they have some sort of extended reach
*  Whether it's some sort of a reach to make sure that you're
*  Vaccinated or some sort of a reach to make sure that your your antibodies are clear
*  Some sort of a reach to make sure that you're not drinking
*  Are you because if you drink you get your immune system shattered if your immune system fucks up?
*  What if you get sick and you pass it on to your friends if you're drinking you're being a bad citizen
*  Like who the fuck knows what could happen once someone's tracking whether or not you're healthy
*  What are you doing man, I see you've only slept seven hours last night like what's that all about Tom
*  Seven hours not a lot of sleeping. Yeah, do you not love your neighbors? Do you want to get sick?
*  Now do you sense or is there any been ever any evidence that that is happening now that there is with our phone
*  Specifically to do you know the phones tracking it is or like are they the concept of it is definitely available, right?
*  the concept of it of contact tracking is being
*  Talked about openly and then if a company
*  Ensures if they figured out I say if like there was a place you go, right?
*  This is be kind of interesting
*  so say if there's a place you go Tom Green you go and
*  They give you a vaccination once a vaccination becomes available and you know that you now
*  Don't have to worry about getting this thing
*  So we can track all the people that have been vaccinated as long as you sign up for the app and all the people not be
*  Vaccinated you see them you see them on the app. Oh my god. Well before we step in this mall
*  Let's see what kind of shitty fucking citizens there are that have been vaccinated or maybe you're not allowed in the mall
*  Yeah, and you'll be able to find them on a map and it will get real weird. Yeah
*  it's like it's another step a really quick step in dragging us into the machine and to take away, you know, the
*  nuances of just human life that we're accustomed to and it become more and more
*  Digitized and organized and
*  It's people need freedom man
*  And if you don't have the freedom to just be somewhere without the government knowing that you're there
*  like if you haven't committed any crime, you're not a criminal and
*  If they could just monitor you and you've never committed any crime that that is a weird place. That's weird things. You're getting weird
*  You're supposed to be you're supposed to be following criminals only
*  And I know it makes it easier for you to follow criminals if you could follow everybody
*  But you are changing what everybody is
*  You're changing what people are if you follow them all the time
*  Everywhere they go if you listen to everything that they ever say through the microphone on their fucking phone
*  You're changing what they are and you're making them scared and everybody knows it and no one wants to admit it
*  You're making people scared and people do things because they don't want censorship. They don't want to be censored
*  They don't want to yell that they self censor. They don't want to be not in compliance
*  It changes their behavior. We all know that we all know that it's dangerous to creativity
*  It's dangerous to authenticity. It's dangerous to so many things
*  It's not it's not a good way to be as a person
*  Like looking over your shoulder people are watching all the time. He was too aware. This is too weird
*  It's too weird to force the whole and then who's got control of that the government like what some people that got elected to a position
*  The only ones to get the look in on everybody
*  Well, and then what if that opens up was it no everybody can look at it everybody fuck it the information act
*  We just got to give into the inevitable. Tell me to watch your shit
*  I'm gonna watch you shit from your toaster because your toaster
*  Your electric toothbrush that knows whether or not you have cavities is listening in while you shit not a pretty sight. Yeah, man
*  It's not gonna be pretty
*  But it's almost like we're taking a step closer and closer towards the digital world with this and that's I don't I'm not a conspiracy
*  Theorist in the sense that I don't I don't I don't think that robots are out to get us
*  I don't think that the electronic world is looking to consume us
*  But I am concerned with some steps that we could take that make our life more
*  Digital to take away too much of what it means to be a person
*  Someone what it means to be a person is like fun
*  There's this there's fun in the weirdness of the world. There's fun in the danger of the world
*  you take away all that shit with apps right and and
*  Alerts and you know and like where I can't go down that street
*  There's a guy down that street that was arrested at one point in time shit
*  You know like what are we gonna do?
*  What are we gonna we're gonna lose out all the mystery of life for safety and then we become what would have become these unromantic?
*  boring bullshit digital things that are locked into
*  pleasure sources
*  Things that pump them pleasure because they've taken the place, you know
*  Mean really if they could do that if they could get to a point where you wear an implant
*  It just keeps your dopamine levels up at a very high high note
*  You get augmented reality glasses where everybody's hot
*  That'd be pretty cool
*  might be
*  Might be better than not. Yeah, that's the problem. I might be better if they lie to you like the matrix remember when
*  That one dude was given into the matrix and he's like look
*  I just want to be an important person don't be like an actor or something. I'm really writing
*  He's you want to taste steak again. Yeah, he's eating steak, right? Yeah
*  Maybe maybe he's right. Yeah
*  it's cool just to sit here and and and I mean I'm just I'm just I mean
*  Thanks for having me. Thanks for being here dude, and thanks for doing that original thing in your house
*  Yeah, no, I didn't do that. I'm telling you man me and redbam we were in your house
*  I was like this is we need to figure out how to do this. Yeah, I even talked to those guys the the Denver people
*  I talked to them at one point in time
*  Yeah
*  but it just didn't I was in the middle of doing a bunch of different shit back then that was right before I moved to
*  Colorado too and I was like, I don't know if I'm even gonna stay here. I don't know what I'm doing
*  I don't you know, and then I was like, I don't know if I want to do that spend all my time doing that
*  I want to concentrate on the shit. I'm already doing but then as
*  Time went on. I just kept thinking about that and I kept thinking about
*  Doing it with nobody I kept thinking about looks not nothing about this for money. Just do it
*  Let's just do this for fun. Don't do you know if I did it with some company or some it's like
*  Yeah, you could do it with serious or some company better to just do it
*  right just do it just to figure out and then slowly that was the
*  The secret spice right there that was that's where you figured it out right there because that has people people see that right?
*  They can tell that yeah, and then that's all documented you go back and watch the horrible early ones. They're all available
*  That but that's no but because of you though, you probably second-guess them
*  But no you here had this it's incredible energy and you're doing your thing and people loved it
*  So even the early ones are people go back and watch the early ones. They're terrible stay away from them
*  We didn't know what we're doing
*  But it's also like everything else the more you do it the better you get at it
*  but because of your risk taking because you were the guy that was willing to set up this crazy set up in your house and
*  Because I knew you and I'm over your place and I'm like wow
*  Like this is you really went deep. I remember like being around your house. I'm Tom Green
*  What have you done? And I was thinking like this might be it like he might be on to something
*  This might be the move like just do it all yourself
*  It's very kind of you to say pretty sure man. It's true. It's you
*  Anthony Kumia opium Anthony Howard Stern for sure the original one. It's all
*  Everybody feeds off everybody. I grew up my group loving David Letterman. Okay. Yeah, David Letterman
*  When I saw him go out on the street with the megaphone and yelling out of his office of people I was like, oh
*  I want to do that
*  Yeah
*  I want to get a megaphone and I would go stand on the roof of buildings in my hometown
*  The video camera yell at people with a megaphone. He's letterman had one of the best styles ever
*  Of like hosting a talk show because he could talk to people that were talking to him about
*  Nonsense that he didn't give a fuck about and he would have the same
*  Enthusiasm as if he was talking to Al Pacino about some Academy Award-winning movie
*  He was in yeah some some rock star like Mick Jagger sat down there. He would talk to him with the same look
*  He had a style like Dave Letterman had of like
*  He's in on the joke style yeah of talking that was my first experience with seeing something that was kind of like anti television
*  Yes. Yeah more sophisticated. Well, he's making fun of television while he's making television. It was and that was
*  Completely dated this girl when I was 25 and she fucking hated the Tonight Show
*  But loved David Letterman and I'm like why I go why is it she goes cuz I don't
*  You know, I don't want you bullshit me
*  She goes I know like he's in on it like David Letterman's in on it. Yeah, the other ones are just bullshitting you
*  The first first time I ever saw somebody kind of you know
*  Goofing on the network. Yes taking the fruit basket over to the security guard at GE
*  You know messing with them getting in trouble his boss, you know
*  It's like are you biting the fan that feeds you here?
*  But I mean the risk that he took to do that was like real you never saw that on TV before everything was and he
*  Was the guy who broke Jay Leno he he brought Jay Leno out to the people
*  Jay Leno at one point in time was the edgy comic. Oh, yeah. He was the guy in the 1970s
*  Yeah, he was they everybody says it everybody who was alive back then said he was the sharpest comic working
*  Yeah
*  And he got on Letterman and would go on Letterman with his jet black hair and
*  Like this sardonic wit and like sharp punch lines and he was the fucking man back then. Oh, yeah
*  Yeah
*  It's kind of crazy. You know where he's at his best for sure is his car show. Oh, yeah sure
*  I love that show. He's himself. That's again. It goes back to what we were talking about earlier
*  What Jay Leno really is is a guy who loves cars, so that's there's no joke in that man
*  He doesn't have to pretend he doesn't give a fuck if you have like a dune buggy made out of a VW
*  Or if you have some crazy souped-up Corvette if you have some crazy NSX from 1994, he loves cars
*  Yeah, he loves them. Like I've been around the guy. He has first of all, he has like 11
*  Warehouses full of cars. I watched your episode with him actually on his show that place is great bananas
*  Yeah, it's bananas. Yeah, he just has car after car after car
*  How many cars do you have a couple hundred cars? I have no idea hundreds occurs 11 buildings filled with car 11 buildings
*  Yeah, some of them are worth a million dollars
*  He's got steam-powered cars and you see him driving living in LA, right?
*  You know, we know this but you know, there's Jay going by in a steam-powered car
*  People look forward to that. He'll drive by on a fucking tractor. He takes carpet on it's supposed to be on the road
*  I'm not kidding. Yeah, he put
*  Old school one with metal wheels and he had rubber put on it so he could take it on the road
*  Is he doing it to be funny though? Like I'm on a tractor right now, or is he just think the tractors cool?
*  Is there an element? I'm just I don't know. I don't know if we would know the answer. We would be a reductionist to either
*  State one way or the other
*  It's just gotta be so much fun for him to be driving around in that no
*  It really is legitimately fun for him
*  One of the things that I said when I was talking to him when he and I were driving around
*  Was like hey man, like you're you're really you when you're doing this
*  It's so much better than doing the Tonight Show and having to pretend that you give a fuck about some teeny boppers knew
*  His new fucking top 40 hit you gotta go. Wow, that's amazing
*  Like you don't give a fuck about that. You care about 65 Corvettes, you know
*  Jay Leno's around a 65 Corvette you see him like how the lines and you see him looking at the steering wheel the seats like
*  That fucking guy loves cars man. He loves them. Yeah, it was bones. Yeah, he loves them
*  He loves no, that's the one with the 454 the 70 Chevelle SS
*  He like he gets into the gritty details of it
*  And I remember thinking like man it was too bad that you ever did the Tonight Show should have just done this
*  Like if somebody had figured out in 1970 whatever that this is what Jay Leno is best at. Oh my god
*  Who'd have been the like the most the greatest car man?
*  Not that he isn't right now
*  But the greatest car celebrity that's ever lived in terms of like a car guy on television
*  Because it's authentic because he really does love it and he's funny like when he does that show that car show is Jay
*  Leno's garage. He's so loose. Yeah, he's like, it's just some self. Yeah, I've watched a lot of those shows. I love that show
*  Yeah, he loves it
*  He loves it's real and you hear stories all the time about oh
*  Yeah, my car broke with some someone in LA's just last week. It happened again. Someone's car broke down
*  No, Jay Leno pulls over his wife gets out
*  Let me fix that for you and then we get you back on the road, you know gold-plated wrenches in his backseat
*  You could literally break down in LA and jail pull over and fix your car
*  Yeah, he probably likes it yeah, he loves cars man like legitimately yes like guys that are working as a
*  Garages, he's always growing his fabricators, right? So his guys are like fixed fenders and shit
*  Put new quarter panels on a car
*  You can do everything. It's nuts
*  The guy loves them loves them and he's got everything man mopars and old fucking Maseratis and
*  So, you know a lot about cars, so no no no no no I know some about cars, but I don't know
*  I'm not to his average
*  Guest that he has on the show
*  Probably was fun when you went in there and yes
*  He loves the fact that I'm an actual car nut. I really I'm a car nut
*  That's a fact, but I'm not a I'm not I'm not good. I don't understand what's going on behind the full-on details
*  Yeah, I'm not turning any wrenches and I know I know what you got a problem with your solenoid switch or something
*  I mean any of that. Yeah, I know what drives good. I know what drives good. I like to drive
*  I like cars that make you feel like you're driving them, too
*  But then again, I like Tesla too Tesla's like it's doing all the work and that you drive that if you ever driven a Tesla before
*  I
*  drove
*  I don't officially I guess I could say this I drove Harland Williams's Tesla
*  First of all when we were talking before about Theo Theo Vaughn
*  He has this language of common it's uniquely his own like Theo just has stuff that you see it written on paper
*  Like what that's funny, and then you see him say it on stage. You can't even breathe you're dying right?
*  I'm Williams. Yeah, Harlan Williams a perfect example that so hey there flapjack. What do you say buttermilk biscuit like?
*  But you're crying laughing and
*  So
*  Harland is one of my best friends in the world
*  I love that dude, and it's it's surreal to me that we've become so close friends because like I was saying earlier when I was a
*  kid I
*  Was his biggest fan. I was actually told him this the other day
*  I was telling him I've told him this probably sorry ten times alone. I was we were just talking on the phone
*  Okay, well I was telling him. Did you ever close on?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah
*  And I did he called into my he called in my podcast
*  I'm sitting in my house by myself and my you know talk I was interviewing my friend
*  so but I was telling him stories like this one about to tell you right now and
*  You know when I was a kid. I would go down when he would come to yuck yucks and at the time
*  And this is probably not exactly a fully accurate statement
*  But for whatever reason at the time it seemed like there wasn't a lot of that kind of weird
*  like
*  Breaking the whole mold of comedy comedy like everyone there was stand-up, and then he was the one stand-up that was
*  really surreal really
*  Strange and silly and so at the time it was it really popped out for me as a goofy kid
*  It was kind of a weird kid what year we talking about
*  88 89 oh wow that's before I met him yeah, yeah back, and he hadn't come to the states yet
*  And and then and then I remember so he was like that from the jump, huh?
*  Yeah, I mean he was so he was headlining in Canada. He's from Toronto. I'm from Ottawa
*  I didn't know him and when I when when when I was 15 years old I was doing the amateur night
*  He was my favorite he'd come into town and
*  I remember one day I went up to him at the bar at the comedy club 15 years old
*  So many for some reason they let us in I went up to him the bar with my friend Phil
*  And we went up to him and I said mr.. Williams
*  Would it be okay if tomorrow we took you out for a submarine sandwich
*  And he's oh
*  Sounds good to me in the next day Saturday
*  We went out in Ottawa took him out for a submarine sandwich, and he was he was drinking his coke like
*  Thanks for the submarine sandwich there fella, you know so he was being himself yeah, he was he was great
*  I mean he was just it was just great. Yeah, and
*  Yeah, it was it was until years later where I actually got to know him where he's you know not always like hey
*  Jerry you know but but so it was it was incredible to get to know him
*  He's always been a friendly guy as long as I've known him. I met Harlan. I think in 94
*  And I'm like what a friendly guy this my thought of him has always been the same what a friendly guy
*  Just always friendly every time I see him. I hug him. I'm always excited to see him. He's always a nice guy
*  He was one of those initial things though in my mind where I saw somebody saying
*  I'm gonna do something that nobody else is doing and I'm gonna be
*  Amazing at it. Well. You know what he figured out you figured out how to be just he's a you he's weird
*  And I want to say unique, but yeah, but it's he's got a weird sense of humor, but he's also really nice
*  So like that weird sense of humor is intoxicating it draws you in like a siren to the rocks
*  And he just starts talking his nonsense, and you just get sucked into the trance
*  And it's it's he just figured out
*  That like we were talking about before there's no right way to do it. There's no right way to do stand-up
*  This is the right way for you, and maybe you're an interesting person. Maybe you people are people vary so much man
*  It's like it's all in like can they figure out how to make their own unique weirdness?
*  Come through and make make jokes out of it and some guys like Harlan figured it out perfectly
*  Well if you wrote it down, it's like you want to steal Harlan Williams act you'd be fucked
*  You would never be able to do it right like Theo Vance to there's no way
*  No one's doing that no one you have to be that guy right yeah
*  He's he's figured out how to make his own unique mannerisms
*  Hilarious top-flight comedy. I love him any no listen. He's here's a guy who's
*  One of the most creative people I know you're obviously one of them
*  And I mean we're lucky to get to know a lot of people that are like top of their field
*  You know Harlan's you know created a show called puppy dog pals
*  It's now going into fourth season on Disney an animated show for kids. It sounds like he's a boy. He created this whole show
*  It's like with you taking that energy and putting it into
*  Your art without compromise which is what he has always done which what you've done. You know and it's it's it's pretty cool
*  I love the guy. I love him
*  It's one of the cool things about living in a place like LA is that there's a lot of people like you and Harlan
*  And you know we can keep going fill in the blanks Joey Diaz and Duncan Trussell and all these
*  Fascinating people Duncan Trussell fellow testicular cancer survivor. Yeah, yeah
*  So many folks I mean we're real lucky Tom Segura Owen Smith Bert Kreischer keep going down the line
*  Yeah, Joey Diaz we live in an amazing spot. There's so many bill burr
*  Santino Tony Hinchcliffe, there's so many interesting people here. It's a good spot and as far as that
*  But we're all spread out
*  What we need to do is buy up a fucking plot of land and put a fence around it called comedy town
*  Now they have like hitting hills be a fucked up a gated community for comedians. Yeah, call it comedy
*  No, you get pretty fucked up in there, but it'd be fun
*  Grow tomatoes shit, so you love it you love LA you think you live in LA for the rest of your life
*  No, no, I'm thinking about getting out now. I heard you mention that I'm watching people drive man people listen
*  There's a lot of people that are under incredible pressure right now financially and that's when people are under pressure
*  That's when they act the most erratic and I was watching this guy yesterday
*  He cut in front of me and then he cut into the left lane and he passed like in
*  Oncoming and he cut in front of the people in front of him and I was like what buddy?
*  Yeah, what did someone is there somewhere you would go where there's not fucked up drivers though
*  We are in a position right now where people are under extreme stress
*  I'm starting to see it a little bit on the road
*  I'm like what is it gonna be like when everything opens back up again?
*  Is this gonna be the best spot? Mm-hmm, or is the best spot gonna be like a little slightly less populated
*  We can go go back. So where would you go? Let's watch this motherfucker from a distance and you see in a distance you see
*  See fire bombs and shit you're like I knew it I knew people were getting sketchy. I knew San Diego was the spot
*  Mm-hmm. I don't know. I don't know what the spot is
*  Up at the mountains of Colorado. I think San Diego is a good spot because it's it's a city, but it's not as big a city
*  It's big enough though. So it's not it's not hick, right, right?
*  Sophisticated but it's not too ridiculous. But you wouldn't miss getting up at the Comedy Store every night
*  What if there's a bomb? What if there's an earthquake? What if the volcano goes?
*  Asteroid impact hits going down to the yeah center of the stand-up universe and
*  Having that I have like every night whenever you want. You wouldn't have that anywhere else
*  I had it and I didn't have it your head again for the Comedy Store
*  I had it for from 93 to 2007 that I didn't have it from 2007 to 2014 that I had it from
*  2014 to today and I'm better off with it, especially the version of the Comedy Store that exists now. I
*  I'm definitely we are all better off for it
*  So it's an amazing place right now
*  and I'm committed to keeping it amazing and doing whatever I can to get it back to
*  financial health and whatever whatever we can do to get everything rolling, but I
*  Think if we had to get out of LA for some strange reason
*  As long as the Comedy Store exists for the comedians that are here, I'm good
*  I think there's a way to not be right here. I just think that right here is so crowded
*  There's good and bad to that you still come back for a couple months exactly rent a house
*  He's a there do stand up the storm. Go go back to your
*  The move is to get like a nice apartment here. Yeah, well you come back
*  Occasionally, yeah, but you watch this beast from the outside and hope play musical chairs
*  Hopefully you don't get stuck here where the music shuts off. Yeah
*  Yeah, I think about a lot cuz I'm from Canada my do you think about going back I do a lot Toronto's shit
*  Yeah, yeah, I love Toronto and where would you go? I'd go back to Ottawa. Just cuz my
*  My parents my brother and old friends there and they still have access TV back then back there rather
*  Like you do cable access show the public access station you imagine if you did that I've thought about it
*  But do you imagine how people would freak out same studio you would get a story on dig for sure
*  Comm it'd be like that'd be good
*  Tom Green goes back to cable access place where he first started I would love that. Yeah, imagine if you did that
*  Yeah, how people would go nuts for that?
*  You know, it's interesting because it's like now we you know, we've got the internet now
*  So it's it's sort of interesting that public access is different now. Yes back then you had to kind of
*  Talk your way into getting in there
*  You know
*  You wouldn't think you can just get a show as you had to kind of talk your way into getting in there
*  And then once you got in there it was nobody was watching
*  but if you did something weird enough for where people would sort of hear about it and we used to send our tapes down to
*  Manhattan neighborhood network in New York
*  You know people would hear about it and it was but it was it was not like the internet, you know
*  Now it's almost hard to imagine why anybody would need to do that when I was an open mic in Boston
*  We did some cable access shows the same same thing
*  I think is your public access TV thing in Canada that cable access shows and I think there was some sort of a rule
*  That if you had a cable channel you had to leave a certain amount of hours open
*  For people to just like regular people to just sign up and do things
*  Me and a few other comics we put together these terrible sketches
*  Uh-huh, and I'm sure they were amazing. They went they were terrible
*  well, we were you know, we're 21 years old and they went up on cable access and
*  I remember one of you have those
*  No, no, I don't know who would have them
*  but
*  It's not a tape somewhere. I seen 88 maybe you don't have the tape. No, I don't have I have every tape really
*  Yeah, I let things go. Yeah, I keep moving. Yeah
*  I keep moving keep moving bitch
*  But I remember like thinking while I was there with my fucking moron comic friends were you know, just silly bitches
*  Doing this stupid show. I'm like who the fuck let us do this
*  I go to the league. I remember I was wearing a dress something about some dating show. That's why you lost the tape
*  If you burned it somewhere, right? I had a dress on and a wig and
*  I
*  Was I think I was the the like it was like a blind dating show or something. I find it so stupid
*  But it was just like it was not funny
*  But I was thinking like sounds pretty funny. They let you just do this sounds pretty funny
*  Yeah, but better better in this like me telling it then actually seeing how bad it really was
*  It was like that's nothing clunky and she nothing bad about that
*  But this is YouTube now it's like
*  YouTube has taken that and no one saw it coming. That's what's so interesting. No one saw
*  Like a thing where anybody could sign up anybody can create an account anybody can upload video
*  Nobody saw that being this thing that would
*  Ultimately like the amount of eyes like Jamie you would know this more than anybody like what are the amount of eyes that are watching?
*  YouTube every day like what's the the total number of human beings that are watching YouTube every day? Let's take a guess Tom Green
*  We take a guess number of eyes watching YouTube every day. Yeah. Yeah a number of
*  May see yeah, I'm trying to think individual humans or individual views because someone watched something ten times that count as ten
*  No, no, I mean individual humans. I want the individual humans
*  so if it was 1 billion that would be like one and eight people which seems like a lot but
*  But it also seems like a number that you would imagine them saying it would be so many views you think it would be a day
*  Let's just that might be simpler. How many views a day does YouTube get?
*  It's funny cuz I don't know but I'm gonna imagine let's see if it was there 8 billion people in the world 7 point something
*  Something yeah something more than 7 so if it was a billion a day
*  That would be crazy that goes that mean like one in eight people watched a YouTube video day or one guy watched
*  realistic that doesn't seem unrealistic it might be a billion
*  I'm gonna just guess that cuz it's a round number. It's a good number. Yeah. All right. I'm gonna go with 700 million
*  This is like prices, right? Yes
*  I
*  Was 1 billion and one then I win right? Yeah, I wanted to give us some
*  Okay prices right rules prices right rules. Okay. What is it?
*  As of September last year daily active users is 30 million, but
*  Monthly active users is 2 billion
*  So there are a larger number go they use it every day versus people that oh I see and I see
*  Yeah, I guess so
*  Million people that are using it every single day how many views though how many views I thought maybe we were playing a different game
*  I was playing views, but no we were playing views. Yeah videos watch per day is 5 billion. Oh
*  prices right rules
*  Five billion a day so that means there's one guy just watching a billion. Yeah, I wonder what
*  Possible there's 8 billion people. Good question. It's crazy. Well, that's how many people are watching
*  How many people how many videos individual people watching will we think the number of videos the average number of videos a person?
*  Watches per day on YouTube we say for how many videos average number average number
*  Come anything. How many you think you would watch average? I
*  Probably watch 5 or 10 a day. So yeah, that's what I'm saying. I'm not even close to that
*  I might watch two or three a day. Yeah, I don't watch a lot of YouTube. I watch a lot of I watch professional pool
*  Watch a lot of it's a good place to watch it on YouTube. Okay way better than anywhere else
*  It's hard to watch pool on TV. It doesn't really exist anymore. Yeah, but you watch it on YouTube
*  There's fucking thousands of videos with hundreds of hundreds of thousands millions of views. I use it for tips with Pro Tools
*  Ah, that's good. I can't figure out how to do something. So then I go how do you you know dude for martial arts?
*  It's one of the greatest resources ever
*  you know so many people give it instructionals on how to throw certain kicks or how to
*  Cinch up certain submissions like jujitsu alone is
*  Accelerated in giant leaps and bounds because of the internet skateboarding too. Oh, I'm sure I'm sure I think it
*  skateboarding thrasher magazine once a week a
*  Magazine would come out you could see a still shot of a guy doing a trick
*  You'd have to imagine was now you kids are watching watching the
*  Repeat and they're seeing exactly where the foot goes exactly how the board spins exactly
*  Then they learn it and then they advance on it and the advance on it said the advancement, you know
*  I'm sure you've talked about this and I'm sure guys do videos and how they do it
*  I've heard drumming like a music for sure young kids are that's what you got
*  All these young kids are like incredible musicians because they go on with YouTube
*  They see it and they replicate it and then they improve on it
*  Yeah, dude, it used to be hard to find a fucking drumming coach
*  They could tell you to drum like Travis Barker who the fuck is gonna teach you how to do that. Yeah now you can watch
*  That's
*  Not on demand. Yeah, I think that's with everything with playing guitar
*  With art there's so many like tutorials about everything yoga
*  Like if you want to just do yoga at home like fucking hundreds of thousands of yoga videos, you know anywhere
*  It's kind of crazy. Like there's never been a better time to be quarantined, right?
*  Right, imagine if this happened in 1990 if you can be a self starter or teach yourself how to be a self starter right now
*  It's a good time to be quarantined. Yeah, just gotta be a self starter. Just gotta get up and go to work
*  I've made a point of trying to do things that I've always wanted to be able to do at home in my house that I
*  Haven't had time to suck your own cock. You know, I'm not gonna say
*  the improvements I've made in that area, but it's amazing what happens if you
*  Mike's nota from Lincoln Park and other bands
*  He's been doing live streams showing like from start to finish how he makes a song
*  I watched one yesterday like an hour and a half. He started from scratch. This is how I use the keys
*  I'm using this is the thought process. I would use yeah, I like how he's color-coded as his waveforms
*  I wasn't but that's Ableton. It looks different. Yeah, that's amazing. Why does that cat have hypnotic eyes?
*  Yeah, well, that's so he was streaming it and that was like this is his live video from his live stream doing donations
*  But that's very cool stuff for people that are following and subscribing and stuff. That's very cool
*  Yeah, it's like something like that
*  Like if you were a kid they want to know how do you make a song like I love Lincoln Park
*  How do I make a song like Lincoln Park? Bam. Yeah, bam
*  And it works now you can get on your computer and have that and it works green
*  You're a part of that you understand that right by creating your Tom Green show
*  You allowed people to think about streaming things from their house
*  I bet you were a part of a lot of people's desire to jump in and do something like YouTube
*  Because if you really stop and think about it before you were doing that before you doing it from your house
*  Are you doing it from that public access station? You know, how many people were doing that? You're a real pioneer Tom Green
*  Legit the pioneers leave with arrows in their back Joe
*  No, you know listen I've always loved technology that's one thing that's kind of
*  interesting when I was when I was a kid
*  My dad was in the military
*  But when he retired from the military after 26 years in the service as a tank commander
*  He continued working for the Department of Defense as a cobalt programmer
*  So he learned he went took a computer course and he learned cobalt and he would go off and he'd have the cards and he
*  Took me and he'd show me these big computers because Ottawa's the capital Canada's there's the government there and there's these big computers
*  And I remember in the 80s early 80s. They had this thing in Ottawa
*  It was called the Naboo Network. It's the weirdest thing you would you would order it in Google this nabu
*  if you don't believe me and it was essentially a
*  Like a VCR sized box you could rent it
*  You would hook your television cable into it and it was the internet. It was basically the internet you could talk to people
*  There was video games got pumped through it
*  So you could play like real arcade style video games on this thing and it was really like way advanced
*  Yeah, there it is. That's it
*  I had that and and my dad always got like the computers that no one else had like everyone had Atari
*  2600 but he went got the naboo because he said no that's Doug Henning by the way the magician the Canadian magician Doug Henning doing
*  Who had the who did the ads for I remember that dude and yeah, so you're sitting there as a kid and
*  You're you're playing like dig dug the arcade game
*  Same graphics quality and it's streaming through your cable. It's not it's not you don't have a cartridge
*  It's streaming through your cable
*  So you're thinking about that and then a lot of my friends were very advanced
*  My friend fells your roo who was the guy who drank coffee in the window in the background of my show on MTV
*  There was a guy who's my best friend
*  he's a
*  So we started doing stand-up together when we were when we were teenagers and then he kind of had to quit when he was
*  17 because he got hired as a computer engineer for the National Research Council because he was a computer genius
*  So there was always this really early sort of
*  computer sort of
*  Things so I've always loved
*  Looking at that technology and going okay. Well, what's gonna happen like so now it's like what's gonna happen next?
*  That's the question. What's gonna happen next? What's the new technology now?
*  What's the thing that's happening now that's gonna be next and I don't know what it is really but it's it's fun to
*  Find to try to figure out artificial intelligence. What's it's gonna be augmented reality? I think yeah
*  I think it's gonna be something that whether Apple comes up with some fucking terminator style. Remember those terminator goggles. Mm-hmm
*  Something terminator style that go what Google glass or Google glasses worth
*  No
*  Just like a weird little thing in the corner of your eye that thing sucked
*  I know but if you had like sunglasses
*  Yeah, like aviators you put on some aviators and you have a whole new view of the world with navigation
*  With emails with voice calls with people where they're translucent
*  You can see the people in front of you so you don't stumble into someone but you still know that you're talking to your friend
*  Bob, you see each other while you're laughing you could split from your view to his view
*  You can see I mean that all that stuff is coming man. That's coming. That's the next step. That's the next step
*  Mike Mike real concern is
*  What I was saying about earlier about if we have tracking on our phones to make sure that we're not
*  COVID-19
*  Positive and like that you're giving up too much. I feel like you've given up too much there. I think people need to
*  People need to be you know
*  Conscious of their health and take care of their immune system and make sure you follow all the protocols and wash your hands and don't
*  Touch your face and all the things that everybody's been saying, but I don't really know if we want to give in to that level of
*  Scrutiny that level of tracking but we'll leave will we even notice it right? It's already happening, right?
*  Yeah, that's the question phones, you know, you put your email in and you know, it's already happening and we saw the convenience, right?
*  So convenient and then all of a sudden everyone's doing it and I'm doing it good call all the sudden
*  It's like baby step baby step baby step. Yeah, so sort of like are we maybe already there?
*  I don't know
*  We might be just when they start implanting chips in our bodies and that's when it gets a little bit
*  when you're going down to the I
*  Don't know the clinic to have them inject a microchip into your this company was
*  Putting chips in their employees arms so they can buy things at the store just by waving their arm. We go through doors
*  Yeah, so they're all ready to get chips
*  And I'm watching this and I've probably watched it four or five times since then but what I'm watching I'm looking at I'm going
*  What are you doing? Like where is this going?
*  You're gonna allow a company with what if Xerox fires you and you get their chip in your forearm. Mm-hmm. What are you doing?
*  Yeah, what are you doing? You're gonna just be walking around with that Xerox chip in your arm
*  What are you gonna get surgically removed some Blade Runner moment?
*  Carve it out. Yeah, no big deal
*  On your own cuz no one will do it for you cuz you're not allowed to take them out
*  If you take the stem cells, it takes two weeks to heal. It's not a big deal carve it out
*  What what are we doing
*  Like listen, I think if we looked at it, you know at ourselves in like
*  1980 and then looked at ourselves in 2020 and said, okay, well, how did this
*  Attachment to phones get so so in just
*  deeply ingrained in the culture without people figuring it out
*  How was it how planned was it to you know, you get this dopamine rush, right?
*  from when you get positive energy back from something positive reinforcement back from something and so
*  Did they know that before they made the text messaging that every time you got a text you get feel good and then you or
*  Did they realize that as they were going oh
*  Look at this people really like this people really like this phone. They really can't put it down
*  Oh, that's cuz they're getting a dopamine rush every time something gets a positive energy. Oh, well, maybe we should double down on that
*  Maybe we should create more of these or was it was it planned from the get-go or was it just like they knew?
*  Yeah, I think it's one of those things that people take advantage once they realize. Mm-hmm. They see it and they go. Oh
*  Yeah, how do we how do we how do we double for you know
*  The all the Cambridge Analytica stuff all that like and how do we give oh, let's give them what they want to see
*  Oh, they're liking this they're liking this. Let's lead them down this garden path. Okay. Now I'm going this way. I'm gonna yes
*  I
*  Don't think there's a cabal of super geniuses that are trying to manipulate people in a way that get them to get addicted to likes
*  Yeah, I think it's something that people realized along the way and they took advantage of it
*  And I also think that what really were what started it what started it was
*  People trying to figure out how to get people to be more engaged
*  What's the best way to get them engaged and the best way to get them engaged turns out is get them upset
*  Right, and then they figured out how to get people upset is to like fill your feet up with things that you engage with
*  Mm-hmm, but they're just trying to get you if you were like really interested in in
*  positive
*  Intellectually enriching ideas. That's what would be in your feet all the time, right?
*  So you're blaming them for you having this like shitty desire to eat Snickers bars all day
*  You're eating mental Snickers bars, huh?
*  You know, but that's that's really what it is
*  like what they're doing is like our Shafir did a test on YouTube and he only searched for
*  Videos of puppies right and that's all that YouTube recommended it right videos of puppies. So all these people like you they're trolling me
*  They're trying to get me know you're interested in those things
*  Yeah, like I'm not interested in abortion when you're reading a boy watching abortion videos
*  But what about when you start talking about stuff you haven't even typed it in and then you see it popping up, right?
*  That's weird. I hate that Jamie. Now. We're just talking about that. What happened a lot to these days the thing that goes on your finger
*  02 pulse reader we had one
*  two days ago, mm-hmm and
*  We didn't say it out loud. We didn't discuss what I think I did. I think I did
*  Saying I'm getting my vitals checked. Yeah, but I didn't say like oh look at that thing on my finger
*  Look at this company that makes pretty sure I did the exact company that made it I got an ad for it
*  I've got it three times the last two hours now
*  I mean, I remember having a conversation about my Toyota truck for a second there
*  What do you think that got to you? My guess is
*  It connects to that for whoever somebody's phone because it's got Bluetooth in it. It connects to something
*  So it's sending out a signal constantly our phones also have Bluetooth on if you leave it on looking for devices connecting constantly
*  Wait, so wait what happened it was listening to you know what I missed
*  No, that's not what he's saying. It's a it's a Bluetooth device that checks your pulse. Okay vitals. Okay, okay
*  Because that is what it is. It is sending out a Bluetooth signal and or in a near-field signal
*  To devices probably the person's phone who owns it or is connected to it, right?
*  But it's also sending out looking for other devices and my phone also is looking out for Wi-Fi signals for Bluetooth signals
*  There's got to be a connection there somewhere where it's tracked how many what devices have been logged in or connected to this within the last
*  Six hours twelve hours. I've heard I've read about this in the past
*  So the possibility would be that this thing I'm just talking about it from a moron that this thing on your finger
*  Sends out a pulse or set reaches out to find out what like maybe Google programs are open
*  Devices I think okay
*  How does it get that cookie into like your Google News feed
*  We start seeing these just like what I was gonna pull up with this chip thing that it's describing here
*  Our phones have ship a cute device number
*  What they actually call it's like I don't remember off top my head, but it's like that MSID number or something like that
*  You're it's almost like your social security number for your for your device. It's not for your phone or anybody. It's just that that device
*  Now there are those that the data mining companies can get that device number and then sell it
*  And that's how it then ends up on your phone
*  Well, they don't necessarily from what I've heard and what I've been told they don't necessarily know that it's you
*  With like your name and your one-of-a-kind serial number, but they can get there
*  So your number they know that you were around that finger thing or your phone was around that finger thing
*  They don't know it's you I've seen a company
*  Offering this data to someone who wants it that like if you wanted to target ads at someone what they could do
*  Maybe like two years ago is like you could find
*  women age 25 to 45 in the United States now
*  Now you could go specific as I like to party
*  I want lawyers that are 37 years old that drink wine that live in this city
*  You can get very specific and they only have that data for the city
*  You can get very specific and they only have that data from this ongoing
*  Collection okay and finding it. Okay. I just think it's weird when it's you don't even sign up for anything
*  It's just your phone starts. It's like it's listening to you, right? I'm assuming it is. Yeah
*  You're talking about Toyota
*  Trucks and then you start seeing them in your newsfeed. Yeah, I'm thinking I'm thinking of getting a Toyota truck which happened
*  I was thinking to get a Toyota truck, right solid choice. Yeah, very reliable
*  93 to a land to call Oh land cruise. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and then all of a sudden
*  Toyota Toyota Toyota Toyota Toyota Toyota Toyota
*  There's a microphone is on it really believe it is out
*  And you know, they always say that everyone says your phone's listening and they're taking but you go you sort of don't believe it
*  But then the lately more and more I really do believe it now and then you go
*  I'll do I try to turn my phone off all the time. I put it on airplane mode all the time
*  I leave my phone on airplane legal to listen to for ads like how's that work? Is that legal?
*  Well, what do we sign?
*  Recognition software taking your name your words and searching them and I mean, I don't know
*  I don't think there's laws against that yet, but it's slippery, right? It's all we're sliding into this digital world wall
*  Just slowly sliding in it's listening everywhere suggesting Tom. I see you're really in a toothpaste
*  Yeah, right. Yeah, you want tooth whitening toothpaste?
*  This is the stuff and then maybe you weren't really into it, but now you are really into it
*  He mentioned it once but now you're seeing it all the time. So now you're really into toothpaste or Toyotas
*  What's the what's the decision this decision to resist the machine or is the decision to enjoy the moment?
*  Just live your life as a one player in this infinite multiverse of lives
*  coexisting
*  dealing with this
*  Illogical singularity that we're all moving towards what's the decision? What do you do?
*  I think it's to be aware of it aware of what they're doing. What is to my ass? I can't believe yeah
*  Look at it. Yeah, right there, right? That's what we're that's when you're aware
*  You're aware it's happening and you are able to not be completely manipulated because at least you're aware of the yeah
*  I suppose to walking blindly through the world and not thinking about the fact that your phone's listening to you or that you're
*  Yeah
*  So I'm really worried about what the next grab is gonna be
*  Because the next grab in order to ensure that people be safe from this kovat 19
*  It's like it's hard man. Once they get some some sort of control and power over you. It's hard to give that shit up and
*  When we're looking at these studies that show that it's not
*  It's least as far as the amount that it's been contained and hasn't spread through the population
*  But the amount of people that actually have been infected how many of them actually died that it's much smaller than they were fearing
*  It would be when are they gonna let us be normal people again, or are they ever? Yeah, are they ever?
*  I mean, we're just wearing masks from now on do we have to wait for a vaccine like
*  Did we decide that it's more spray down there?
*  Why is it saying is it is it more?
*  Is it worse to die from this than to die from the flu or to die from all these other things?
*  And you know what else is really interesting I was reading this thing where there might be a
*  Balance, you know a lot of people died from kovat, right?
*  It's not to diminish the amount of people that died but that because people are staying at home less people have died from automobile accidents
*  That it might turn out to be
*  Money back on my car insurance because of that. Yeah, and do you see how low gas is?
*  Gas is free. They're giving you gas
*  Oils
*  Because no one's driving they pay you to fill up now. It's gotta be negative 35. Everyone's driving. It'll be more valuable
*  What's the other factors the illuminati lizard people want?
*  They haven't stopped making it
*  Well, these fuckheads need to keep it at a dollar fifty a gallon cut the shit
*  We're trying to rebuild this economy you fucking greedy lizard people
*  That's a
*  There's people that believe that right this people believe like David Ike still I was watching that London real interview
*  He said he it's still he believes that he saw someone's eyeballs turned to lizard people
*  Yeah, you say on that one or you say on the other one. No, he said on the value
*  Tainment there's a value tainment podcast
*  They're interviewing him after the London real podcast was taken up the air
*  And he said he saw people's eyeballs turned into reptile eyeballs, right and I'm like Chuck, please
*  Yeah, yeah, please could have been some good LSD maybe it worked or maybe it didn't really happen. Yeah, that's true
*  Maybe you just wanted to or maybe it did happen. Maybe it didn't yeah. Yeah. Yeah, likely it didn't probably not
*  Yeah, this idea that people are lizards
*  It's hard enough just being a person just just dealing with people people, you know, you know evidence of lizard people stop
*  Let's try to figure this out together. You're distracting everybody. Well, this lizard talk
*  I think we want to believe that there's something that can't be explained
*  So that 5g the towers the 5g Tom Green, right?
*  So what's that all about paying attention to 5g? Yeah research flat earth in and 5g
*  You probably had the flat earth people here, right? This is a little Duvall. You know little Duvall on Instagram
*  He had a hilarious
*  Point that he put up. I think he retweeted somebody else's point. This is like five countries
*  with 5g towers and
*  More than a hundred countries that have kovat 19. How the fuck do you think right?
*  It got from there to all those people do you really think it's 5g? Yeah, some people do yeah
*  Some people think it's 5g man, it's amazing how things can just kind of
*  Grab a hold on the internet. Here's the question. It was 5g. How would you find out?
*  Do you think Verizon will let you know if 5g just started fucking people's heads up and they started running into walls to think
*  Verizon be like hey guys, maybe we you caught us you caught sorry. Yeah, you got us
*  What would they do if it really was 5g our bad? We were trying to sting if 5g really did fuck people up
*  Well, you know I look I've always asked myself, you know going back to just talk about radio waves
*  Radio waves microwaves
*  I mean, I've always wondered on co is do more people have cancer now as a cancer survivor
*  I go did I get cancer because I grew up in a world where there's radio waves and cell phones and all this stuff in
*  There or or just people living longer and getting cancer. I don't know. I mean, I don't know but do you wonder it's got to affect
*  The human body to send I don't know. What is it radio wave electronic energy through the air
*  I'm going through your body through your cells. It's got to affect it, right?
*  so so you could sort of see how somebody might think that
*  you know that that that a stronger signal could potentially affect the cells in your body maybe but but
*  You know, I go why start now. Let's go back to just
*  Radio, you know microwave ovens, you know, yeah, who knows who knows I don't think so. Yeah
*  Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of factors, but I think that biological factors
*  No, they found in instances and I believe they found in like cave people and certain animals
*  They found cancer and all sorts of animals. Yeah. Yeah and wild animals. They've found cancer in them
*  It's cancer is a weird thing. Yeah, and we can't assume like what when someone is born
*  With certain diseases, right?
*  We don't we don't try to make some sort of environmental
*  Connection always to the fact that they're born with certain diseases even people that are living in paradise with no toxins in the environment
*  There's still the weird randomness the giving birth
*  two people conceiving a child and the child coming out and what
*  Everything has to be in order all the ducks have to be in a row to make sure there's no diseases
*  like with there's so many variables man and one of the variables is cancer and
*  The fact that some people get it and some people don't and some people live their lives
*  Terribly, they abuse the fuck out of their bodies. They take all kinds of drugs and nothing happens. It's crazy
*  Yeah, and then this people like you they just live normal and they get cancer and if you didn't pay attention to it
*  You could have died. That's just how it is. The world is weirdly random in that in that sense where it's not fair
*  Genetics are not fair
*  Intelligence is not fair
*  Creativity is not fair. There's no fair. There's no fair and if you start looking for fair fairs in your household
*  Okay fairs amongst your clan fairs amongst your loved ones fairs
*  Not the outside the outside world is a wild competitive battleground of ideas and actions
*  It's not fair. It's not fair at all. And how do you prevent that randomness from scaring the shit out of you?
*  You can't
*  That's where weed comes along yeah, you can't man. Yeah, you can't you you just got to keep on keeping on
*  Yeah, there's no way
*  You can't if you prevent it from scaring the shit out of you, then you're not paying attention to it
*  Or you'd have to block it out completely if it wasn't terrifying
*  Because if you're paying attention to it's gonna be terrifying
*  If you're not blocking out completely you look at the randomness of just the fact that we're in this planet with no roof
*  And we're hurling through the galaxy and there's all these asteroids out there and you know
*  Sometimes they don't see them because they're coming from behind the Sun. They just fucking slam into us and kill everybody
*  Yeah, I spent a lot of time trying to decide what freaks me it more the infinity of the universe or the infinite infinity of being dead
*  you know like
*  Infinity of the universe or the infinity of that goes forever and once you're dead well, that's forever too right there's there's no
*  What's what's scary infinity here? What's what's stranger? This would be the scariest yeah the infinity of the universe if you
*  Live forever, and you can breathe in space, and you didn't need food
*  And you were just floating forever and go see what the fuck's going on out there
*  You can't doesn't you're never gonna land you're never gonna touch ground
*  Just gonna float through forever for billions and billions of years without ever talking to anybody, but you're never gonna die
*  That sounds terrifying that might be the worst yeah that may be way worse than dying. Yeah, I think that would be I
*  Mean what is worse than dying wishing you were dead?
*  Flying forever for billions years you know bored
*  You'd be after the first billion years and realize you have an infinite amount of billion years left
*  We're still gonna be alive breathe in air with no need for food no friends. You know what you know now
*  We've been transformed by the gods
*  Into this this symbol of psychic torture
*  You're the god green that Tom Green in 2021 God came back to show us all a lesson
*  He let Tom Green breathe in space and fly on forever and live forever, right and then you you streamed your thoughts
*  Can't land on the planet around there's no landing no I'm gonna be up in space forever be frustrating to fly right by a great
*  Planet and yeah one planet looks like Lake Havasu where girls other tops. Yeah, you go. They're all drinking you can't go down
*  Can you see it though how closely come out? How can you see it close enough to jack off?
*  But then back in the space again it might not be so bad then you get that every billion years you come around
*  Oh every billion planet Havasu. It's not a daily Havasu
*  I
*  Three times daily
*  Five times daily. It's like what was that movie? Do you remember that movie that was about like?
*  Goddamn it Porky's Oh
*  Canadian yeah with Porky's Canadian the biggest independent film of all time
*  Was Porky's at the time probably it's I'm sure that's changed now was that an independent film
*  Yeah, and I remember when I remember that because that was my my age right you know our age right you know when you were
*  Like a kid and all of a sudden there was like you could see yes, you could see
*  boobies in a movie it was pretty much so I
*  Was the movie to see that was the movie to see man
*  That was a you could pork eyes make that movie today porkies. Yeah, they're all yeah
*  There was no chance. It was some some weird shit. It was a rape fest
*  Right. I just remember some weird shit in there for sure. Yeah by standard current definitions. Yeah. Yeah
*  There's a lot of sexual assault wasn't there I have to go watch it again. Yeah, me too. Well. There's definitely
*  Some peeping Tom type activities weren't they there yeah some violence
*  There we go whoa
*  There's a lot of those what a great film. Yeah. Oh, yeah when we were kids. This was the shit, right?
*  What year was this oh my god sounds 14. This was the shit dude. Yeah, oh, yeah
*  Yeah, this was
*  This movie is probably a time capsule
*  And there's moments in that movie where when you're a kid and you're seeing that and there's no internet and you're seeing something that you've never
*  Even fathomed before and look what they did too. They made it about an earlier time
*  They made it they got off the hook by making it a nice right there. Is it I don't know maybe not oh
*  And that's from sex in the city, right? Oh, yeah
*  Okay control yeah control Kim control yeah, yeah, I knew she was in this is the scene
*  I was gonna bring up I didn't want to mention
*  Because I felt weird mentioning it who stayed hot longer than Kim control. Yeah, she hung in there strong
*  Multiple decades Porky's 1981 son all the way to sex in the city go back a little bit on that though
*  Let me see those cars from the 1950s like before that I've been the cars are pulling into the parking lot
*  Like look they did it all
*  Yeah, there it is so look at those cars those are all like
*  1953 cars so they they did it all in an even earlier time
*  Yeah, so they got off the hook by saying yeah people back there. They're fucking cave people the 1950s grabbing tits
*  Yeah, spitting on their dicks, and it was an innocent time. Yes
*  Well, it's also a time where you could do these outrageous ridiculous movies and people just roll their eyes and go, oh
*  They wouldn't you know protest you have you D platform from everything come out of theater
*  Then there'd be the VHS of it and everyone talk about it. You're like the ski movies
*  They have the snow hot dog
*  Yeah hot dog in yeah fast times at Richmond High of course got that big
*  We know when Phoebe Cates gets out of the pool everybody sort of paused that rewound that the coming-of-age high school movie
*  Yeah, was giant and it was you know I mean for people who don't remember young people
*  I mean can you even imagine a world without an internet so that was your only access to seeing
*  any sort of
*  Nudity right I wonder I think we have it best
*  Yeah, because we were born and raised with no internet, and then we found the internet later in life
*  So we realize how crazy it is whereas these kids that are growing up today
*  They've always had the internet the concept of no internet is so alien to them
*  Yeah, and when you when you don't have
*  Instant access to seeing anything you can imagine then your mind has to use its creativity to come up with
*  Ideas and visualize it yes, you know they don't have yeah, it doesn't exist now, so so that was I'm glad
*  I'm glad that we grew up in that era dude. We got lucky
*  We really did because that time was like and no one's ever gonna get that again
*  You never get it again, and we were the fuck up and the society restarts
*  But then you're gonna learn how to kill a bird with a rock all right you're gonna be starving to death right if society resets
*  That hard you'll be fine. You'll you know no one's gonna be fine, but listen that life is horse shit
*  You don't want to live that the fact that we could
*  The fact that we're young enough to enjoy all the technology now
*  Yeah, you and I are young enough to enjoy it the same way young
*  But we also are old enough to have remembered as adults living life
*  Without it is kind of a luxury and we're the only generation
*  We're the only age group that will ever experience that for sure
*  So that's a unique perspective did you have pong as a kid yeah first video game
*  So yeah me too, so pong which we used to have was the most crude video game
*  I didn't have it you didn't have my friend Sean pot they had it, but you were around what you experienced
*  Yeah, it was probably though a great would have been fifth grade
*  I would go over to his house after school, and I was like I remember I remember he was like
*  Yeah
*  Wait what you're controlling the movement of the television. There's a there's a thing on you you're controlling it
*  Yeah, and it was now you want to play call of duty. They're pulling sniper shots on people making their fucking heads explode
*  Look Jamie gets excited about that look at them. Is that what you're addicted to call of duty. Yes, how bad?
*  How bad is your addiction? I didn't play yesterday. Oh you took a day off. We sweating no I almost played
*  And a game footage instead you know you just watch somebody play for half an hour there and get your fix oh
*  Get a little fix watch a little twitch fix is that what twitch is good for watch through their eyes
*  See how they pull off a shot to commit
*  Those goddamn video games, that's how they're gonna get you to I mean think about how big that is bit video games now first of all
*  They were already at the borderline of being bigger than the film industry right and then they got bigger than the film industry
*  And now the film industry is taking a big hit because people aren't going to the movies
*  So they're gonna have to go straight to iPhone so or Apple TV or Amazon
*  That's what a lot of them are doing now right does that mean?
*  We're getting closer and closer to living inside the machine because you live inside that computer game. It's more exciting mm-hmm
*  Let's say everything's coming through your TV now even the movies coming through TV. How's a movie gonna compete with call of duty?
*  Fortnite is launching Travis Scott's new
*  Song and
*  Music video or something today like in the game that made a character for him there launched
*  It's not it might be happening right now actually and not only do you not have to leave the house?
*  But we're not allowed to leave the house so it's all gonna do that in games have stand-up comedy specials in games
*  It's gonna be an option now. It's gonna be an option you can have an audience
*  You can go to the Tom Green Theatre
*  And you walk in and sit down and the curtain parts and Tom Green gets on stage and does a special
*  Did it once with a DJ and it was live
*  He was talking live
*  I don't know what he could see to you know like on his end if he had a room with like all the thousands of
*  Servers that were open. Holy shit do that that would be awesome, but they're very close already
*  Yeah, they're gonna be able to do it. I've seen
*  360 degree YouTube videos have you seen those we can move your cursor around
*  It's crazy you can like move to different spots in the room virtual reality didn't take off though
*  Did it the glasses it didn't take off when they first invented it because I don't think the technology was ready but before the
*  Quarantine there's a thing that we were playing down the street called sandbox, and it's amazing. Yeah, it's really good
*  Dude, like there's one words was a Deadwood mansion
*  That was called you put you have a haptic feedback vest on and you have a rifle and you have these goggles on you put
*  The headphones on you have things that go around your wrists and things grow in your ankles
*  Attracts your movement and then you're in a haunted mansion and fucking zombies are coming running at you and you're gunning them down
*  And it's wild they're dropping out of the roof and right in front of you and they grab you they hit you
*  You see red in front of you and you feel it on your vest. It's not and then the graphics are gonna get better
*  Yes, they're way better now than then you're not gonna want to leave we had John Carmack come in
*  John Carmack is the guy who designed quake
*  He designed a 3d engine for doom and quake and all those amazing video games and then he was working for oculus
*  So he came in with this the newest oculus the newest oculus is just a headset
*  You put it on and it works off of an iPad. You have a headset and these two things you have no tether
*  There's no cord attaching you and it has like this clearly designed
*  Framing for your game playing area. So like you frame the room
*  So if your room is like out here big like a warehouse you can walk around like 30 feet this way and 30 feet that way
*  And make a 30, you know foot square and 30 foot knee to each direction
*  And then it knows that's the game footage and shows you where the walls are
*  So it gives you this view of like don't go past here
*  It gets opaque and now you know and you back up and now you're inside the haunted house again
*  All right. Now you back up and you're in the alien spaceship again
*  It's nuts what they can do now and when the graphics get better and then the world gets bigger
*  Yes, that's when you don't want to leave because you feel like you can actually physically go explore and never find the end of it
*  Well, then what was that one game where you make universes you make planets and worlds called no man's sky, but
*  It's like a never-ending
*  Self-perpetuating type as you kept going it just made more
*  I don't know if it worked out the way it was designed or a way it was advertised, but
*  They're still working on it. And that's just one step though to get further and that is gonna probably be
*  Like the inspiration for someone when new technology emerges to take it to the next level and come up with some other even more
*  deeply immersive game
*  Once they did once they really get that haptic feedback shit down precise where you can feel someone grabbing your tits
*  Feel someone
*  You know, yeah, well that's what you're into I mean if you're getting attacked
*  Oh game kicking the door and some guy jumps on you and grabs right now
*  You know, right bang bang bang and then it drops the ground. Fuck. This is crazy. Like you felt him choking you
*  Like all that I mean
*  movies
*  Like the revenant right where Leonardo DiCaprio gets attacked by that grizzly bear
*  Yeah, imagine if you had a suit on that lets you get attacked by a grizzly bear
*  Yeah, that you've seen right but it throws you to the ground
*  It's biting on you shaking you like you leave you like holy fuck, you know, it's just some suit
*  That figures out how to manipulate your body the same way would be manipulated in this video game
*  I haven't done a lot of that stuff, but it's like that your mind does believe it, right?
*  Well, you walk there's the one where you walk to the edge of a thing
*  You look down you get vertigo and you know, you're in a thing, but your mind just see you walk a plank
*  Yeah, we actually had a plank. I think I saw it on your show actually
*  Well, we don't think so. We know did I see it here or we've seen that on the about it
*  We definitely talked about yeah. Yeah, you could put a board down on the ground. Yeah, two by four
*  I saw that recently some walk on it and it seems like this is the board you're walking on and look below you
*  You see the city streets. Yeah, I saw that recently on the internet. Yeah, how long until you can fly?
*  How long until you ride one of them avatar dragons?
*  go through
*  Pangea, where is it? What was it?
*  Pandora Pandora go through Pandora
*  Riding on a dragon. How long not that long man less than a hundred years hundred years from now. You're just gonna
*  And you gotta be gone I'm gonna be in some other universe you being some other world you're gonna be Luke Skywalker
*  You're gonna be Mickey Mouse. It's gonna happen man. It's gonna happen a hundred percent
*  How long does it take?
*  You know, how long does it take for that happens and will it be gradual or will it be one big leap?
*  We don't see it coming and we're all like those
*  Buffalo that the Native Americans used to push off the cliff or one of them would go off the cliff and then the other one
*  Well, fuck there's a clip but there's like a thousand Buffalo behind you that don't know it's a cliff. They just keep pushing. Yeah
*  When that headset goes on and it's way more satisfying than reality. Yes, we're gonna have a trouble
*  No trouble
*  That's just gonna the thing that's gonna push it. I'm sure that war that will probably be what happens
*  What pushes every technology? Yeah push streaming push to VHS push so many things porn video video for sure
*  once they figure out how to
*  Literally and have it feel like you're having sex with a porn star
*  Yeah, like she has sex with a guy that guy wears a headset and then you put that headset on and it's like
*  They're having sex with you. Yeah, why leave the house at that point? Why?
*  It's ready your temples what if that's how we have to watch avatar 2 or 3
*  Oh, no, I'm not doing it James Cameron first trying to get me to be vegan. Now. You want me to be a robot?
*  But the avatar what was that like the avatar depression syndrome when people like no, yeah, man
*  That was legit or whatever
*  No, people got avatar depression because they went to see avatar and they wish their lives with that noble
*  They wish their lives with that important and amazing people that have a V depression
*  Yes, it was real because they realized that we live a bullshit life. Yeah, and they want to ride a dragon
*  And then fucking shoot bows and arrows at the bad guys
*  They got avatar depression it was like a real thing because so many psychologists were talking these people so many
*  Psychiatrists were treating these patients that they were so they just started calling it something like well
*  How many guys are you getting every day that are sad because avatars not real?
*  How do you do this as
*  Often as you do the energy the mental energy that it must I mean, this is awesome
*  I mean, but like for me like I don't have to we've been on here for mentally ill. This is easy
*  This is how I am
*  Amazing
*  I just found something that works with whatever's fucked up about me. Whatever's fucked up about me as I'm interested in shit
