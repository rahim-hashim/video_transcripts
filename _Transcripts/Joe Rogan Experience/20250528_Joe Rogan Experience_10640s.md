# Joe Rogan Experience #2328 - Luke Caverns
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6.0s)]
*  We're up. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10.0s)]
*  What's up? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=11.0s)]
*  How are you, man? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=12.0s)]
*  Hey, man. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=13.0s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=14.0s)]
*  It's great to meet you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=15.0s)]
*  It's a pleasure to meet you as well. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=16.0s)]
*  I really enjoyed you on the Jesse Michaels podcast, so I had to have you on. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=17.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, thank you so much, man. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=21.6s)]
*  I love it when young people know so much about ancient history. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=23.04s)]
*  How did you get started in this? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=26.48s)]
*  It's quite literally in my blood. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=29.96s)]
*  Back in the late, I should say the 1890s, my family, they were cattle rustlers right [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=32.52s)]
*  here in the hill country, actually maybe a little bit further, quite a bit further west [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=40.16s)]
*  of San Antonio. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=44.8s)]
*  Damn, you come from a lot of criminals? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=45.8s)]
*  Probably, yeah. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=48.24s)]
*  There's a lot of dark history in here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=49.24s)]
*  So, they're cattle rustlers that are out in Dryden, Texas, in Sanderson, Texas, right [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=54.52s)]
*  on the Rio Grande. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=61.24s)]
*  That's how they made their money. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=63.88s)]
*  They were fascinated, kind of like everybody, with finding gold, with finding lost Spanish [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=64.88s)]
*  treasure and Native American artifacts. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=69.24s)]
*  So they're living in this area called the Reagan Canyon. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=72.4s)]
*  I've seen it all over the place. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=75.64s)]
*  If you look on, I think the Smithsonian did something on the top 10 forgotten places in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=78.86s)]
*  the United States, it's like the most remote areas of our country. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=82.84s)]
*  Somewhere in there is Reagan Canyon. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=87.04s)]
*  Out there, they developed this fascination for looking for lost Spanish gold. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=89.92s)]
*  There were bandits that would hide up in the hills and they would sack Spanish caravans [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  and drag the gold up into the hills to not get caught, to hopefully come back for it [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=99.0s)]
*  later. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=102.36s)]
*  The Spanish are out there mining for gold and everything. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=103.36s)]
*  My family gets caught up in one of the biggest mysteries of Texas history. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=106.44s)]
*  If you were to go to some bookstore, there's a popular one called the Sons of Coronado. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=110.64s)]
*  It's like this legacy of people looking for Spanish gold. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=115.68s)]
*  Somewhere in there, my family will be in there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=118.68s)]
*  This started in the 1890s. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=121.28s)]
*  It's this long saga of the treasure being dragged to San Antonio and all these people [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=124.64s)]
*  get killed and only one of these four Reagan brothers makes it out. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=130.08s)]
*  He gets involved in oil drilling out in East Texas. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=133.56s)]
*  My family moved out to East Texas and then his son was born, which is my grandfather. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=139.32s)]
*  He continues this legacy of continuing his father's oil company, but then he also begins [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=144.0s)]
*  gold mining in New Mexico. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=150.12s)]
*  While he's out in New Mexico, he hears these legends of these seven lost Spanish gold mines. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=151.12s)]
*  There was a local police officer who was like a treasure hunter and he knew who my grandfather [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=158.2s)]
*  was and the story behind our family. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=161.68s)]
*  He sought them out and they went off looking together. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=164.14s)]
*  I don't know how long it took them to find it, but he found the seven lost Spanish gold [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=166.8s)]
*  mines of New Mexico. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  He opened up this company called Three Bells Mining and Milling Company. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=173.24s)]
*  That was open for about eight years. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  They opened up these mines that go back to probably about the 1530s. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=179.96s)]
*  The Spaniards were up all the way in New Mexico in the 1530s and they were opening up Native [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=187.0s)]
*  American gold mines and expanding them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=193.74s)]
*  He found these gold mines that go hundreds of feet into the ground as this huge expansive [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=197.06s)]
*  gold mining operation. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  Somebody dies after a smelter explodes and the company goes under. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=204.46s)]
*  They lose everything. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=207.82000000000002s)]
*  My family falls into poverty. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=208.82000000000002s)]
*  My dad's born during that time and my dad didn't really get to experience all of that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=210.56s)]
*  excitement. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=215.9s)]
*  He had to spend his life climbing out of poverty, but he had this love for history. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=216.9s)]
*  He had this love for American history really and he instilled in me the importance of history [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=221.68s)]
*  growing up. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=226.8s)]
*  That fascination of exploration and ancient American history, hearing those stories carried [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=228.6s)]
*  over into me during my childhood. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  I have always been fascinated by this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=239.28s)]
*  I guess getting to where I am now, I was halfway through my marketing degree in college. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm sitting on my bed in my dorm room with my girlfriend at the time who I'm married [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=248.36s)]
*  to now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  We watched the movie The Lost City of Z about Percy Fawcett. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=253.4s)]
*  Something about that guy's journey reminded me so much of my family. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=256.76s)]
*  It reminded me of my dad, reminded me of my grandpa. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=259.88s)]
*  It changed something in me. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=263.04s)]
*  That day, I could not ignore, I was probably 20 at the time, I could not ignore this love [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=264.04s)]
*  that I'd always had for ancient history. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=269.6s)]
*  Archaeologists are poor. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=272.16s)]
*  It's an extremely hard life and it's really hard on your family too. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=275.2s)]
*  I just knew I had to create a life for myself where I could do what I loved because I had [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=279.6s)]
*  like a 1.7 GPA in college and I was not going to make it through my classes. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=284.36s)]
*  I changed. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=289.32s)]
*  I got a degree in cultural anthropology. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=290.32s)]
*  We had a mock thesis statement and I wrote it on the Amazon and the lost civilizations [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=293.48s)]
*  and how they were wiped out from Spanish influenza. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=297.88s)]
*  Yes, that's where I'm at today. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=303.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  I think everybody, when you start looking at the history of the human race and you start [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  looking at the history of civilizations, everyone gets fascinated because we kind of like woke [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=311.24s)]
*  up in this life. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=315.92s)]
*  We didn't choose to be born during this timeline. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=319.8s)]
*  We woke up in this timeline and we're like, how did collectively we get here? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=322.36s)]
*  And then you have this narrative of how collectively we got here. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  Then you see there's holes in this narrative and it's real weird. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=331.16s)]
*  And then you find out about asteroid impacts and super volcanoes and then there's people [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=335.36s)]
*  like Zahi Hawass who are in charge of telling you what they know and this is the only answer. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=340.08s)]
*  And you're like, well, that guy's not right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=345.72s)]
*  And then you start looking at guys like Graham Hancock. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=347.36s)]
*  Why is everybody calling him a Nazi? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=349.32s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=351.28s)]
*  And then you start getting deep into the weeds and this stuff and you're like, wow, there's [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=352.28s)]
*  a lot of resentment from the gatekeepers. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=355.68s)]
*  There's a lot of people that have been, they've been teaching a narrative and teaching in [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=358.76s)]
*  school and they don't want anyone else teaching this stuff. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=363.92s)]
*  They want to be the only people that can tell people what the history of the human race [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=368.88s)]
*  is. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=373.36s)]
*  And unfortunately for them, there's too much other evidence. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=374.36s)]
*  It's too weird. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=379.2s)]
*  The whole picture is not settled. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=380.92s)]
*  And they keep finding new things all the time that throw a monkey wrench into the gears [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=384.8s)]
*  of the timeline of civilization. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=391.48s)]
*  And so then you find out about Egypt. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=393.88s)]
*  And once I, I mean, that was the big one for me. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  Once I found out about Egypt, not found out about it, but you like really started exploring [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=399.92s)]
*  it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=403.64s)]
*  When you discovered every grain of sand in Egypt. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=404.64s)]
*  I discovered the hole. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=406.52s)]
*  I was there. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=407.96000000000004s)]
*  I dug the hole when I... [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=409.44s)]
*  That went about as well as I thought it would when you told me. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=415.08000000000004s)]
*  I was hoping it was going to go a little better, honestly. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=418.04s)]
*  Well, he had a great opportunity to like win over the popular audience and come in and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  make a really good impression. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  And he did exactly the opposite of that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=426.04s)]
*  Well, I think there was a bunch of problems there, ego being one of them, but another [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=427.56s)]
*  one being a language barrier. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=430.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=431.88s)]
*  Also years of battle. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=433.44s)]
*  Like if you're in conflict with people about this very thing that we're talking about for [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  years and years and years, and these people that you're in conflict with keep winning. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=439.88s)]
*  You know, like I remember there was an old documentary that was narrated by Charlton [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=444.52000000000004s)]
*  Heston. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  He was the host of it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=451.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't know if you ever saw this, The Mysteries of the Sphinx? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  Yes, I've seen it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=454.52000000000004s)]
*  I've seen it on YouTube. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=455.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=456.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=457.88s)]
*  I believe it was on television at the time. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=458.88s)]
*  And one of the things in that was they were trying to talk about Robert Schock's work [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=461.48s)]
*  with the water erosion around the Temple of the Sphinx. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  And there was this very arrogant archaeologist, I don't remember his name, but I remember [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=472.36s)]
*  he had a smackable face, who was just so arrogant. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=476.64000000000004s)]
*  He's like, where is the evidence of this civilization that existed 10,000 years ago? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=479.76s)]
*  Well, now we have evidence. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=487.08000000000004s)]
*  Like Gobekli Tepe threw a giant monkey wrench into the gears of this narrative. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=490.92s)]
*  And now they're forced to reckon with this. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=497.15999999999997s)]
*  Zahi didn't even know what Gobekli Tepe was, which was insane. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=499.08s)]
*  Yeah, there was a lot of things that he wasn't familiar with, like Zeptepe or the, it's either [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=503.71999999999997s)]
*  the Turin or the Turid Kings list, which talks about the pre-dynastic, like semi-mythological [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=509.32s)]
*  kings going back tens of thousands of years. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=514.4399999999999s)]
*  How do you? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=518.28s)]
*  Not know that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=519.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, how was, was he the former head of the Ministry of Antiquities and Culture? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  How are you not familiar with this? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=525.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=526.64s)]
*  Well, he just dismisses it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=527.64s)]
*  But aggressively. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=529.16s)]
*  Which is like, there's no way you know everything. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=531.04s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=534.0s)]
*  And then it was also the data from the Italian scientists that were studying this tomography [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=535.12s)]
*  and this ability to look underground with satellite radar and also dismissing that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=542.26s)]
*  And then I brought up the Temple of Osiris and they looked into that, like you could [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=547.3199999999999s)]
*  see it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=550.6s)]
*  They have, like, they showed where the chambers are. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=551.6s)]
*  It works. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=554.88s)]
*  But this was only 50 feet underground. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=555.88s)]
*  You know, like, okay. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=559.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, pretty well. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, how do you know how deep that stuff goes? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=561.3199999999999s)]
*  If it works 50 feet, who's to say it doesn't work two kilometers? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=563.4s)]
*  Like they're saying. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=566.8s)]
*  Yeah, I was having a conversation with like my mentor, Dr. Ed Barnhart. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=568.48s)]
*  He's a friend of Graham. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=574.8s)]
*  He was one of Graham's guest experts on Season 2 of Ancient Apocalypse when he went to the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=576.36s)]
*  Maya realm. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=580.36s)]
*  He and I were talking this morning and he was like, you know, it's become a battle of, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=581.36s)]
*  like, who has this right to talk about these things? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=585.0s)]
*  Does the fact that I have a degree in anthropology, that's what gives me the right to have more [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=589.6400000000001s)]
*  of an opinion on somebody else? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=595.7600000000001s)]
*  That's kind of what it's become. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=597.6s)]
*  And it's like one side is accosting the other over their fascinations and their interests [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=599.84s)]
*  and the fact that they're able to make a living from the things that they're fascinated about [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=605.32s)]
*  and talking about it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=608.6s)]
*  And it feels like academia has become bitter because, you know, being in the academic world [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=610.36s)]
*  is a very rough and jaded place. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=617.6s)]
*  And a lot of young aspiring archaeologists who existed, who maybe would have had an approach [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  like me, but existed during this time where you could only have your pursuits if the university [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=627.68s)]
*  signed off on it, right? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=634.32s)]
*  But now universities are like ideologically captured and every little thing that you do [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=636.0400000000001s)]
*  has to be aligned with the university. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=640.2800000000001s)]
*  And so all of your fascinating ideas that you have in your mid-20s, you know, to your [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=642.7800000000001s)]
*  mid-30s when you're young and able to go off into the jungle and find something, they all [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=646.8000000000001s)]
*  get shut down by people who had their ideas shut down. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=650.6s)]
*  But now it's like, it's the Wild West where you can have somebody like me or whoever put [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=653.6s)]
*  together an expedition and, you know, I legally cannot start digging up the ground and excavating [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=658.74s)]
*  things, but I can go and document things and survey things on my own, you know, with local [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=663.84s)]
*  permission, whatever. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=668.0400000000001s)]
*  But yeah, it's like... [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=669.26s)]
*  Can you legally dig things up in certain countries if you get permission? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=670.26s)]
*  Or is it... [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=675.72s)]
*  Oh, well, I mean, yeah, if I got permission, but I mean, you would be, it would be next [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=676.72s)]
*  to impossible for me, for somebody like me to do that. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=681.52s)]
*  Why would that be? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=684.5600000000001s)]
*  What would be the hurdles? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=685.5600000000001s)]
*  Oh, well, you would have the local universities there who also have their own, you know, high [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  credentialed people who are going to, you know, if I don't come in with a PhD, I'm never going [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=691.26s)]
*  to go get a PhD. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=694.5s)]
*  But if I don't come in with something like that, then I don't have the experience, I [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=696.12s)]
*  don't have, you know, the authority to be able to do something like this, and they would [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=698.88s)]
*  never trust me to carry out like a good excavation. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=702.16s)]
*  Right, not damage anything. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=705.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so they would never trust that. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=706.38s)]
*  There's some reasonable explanations for why. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=708.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, kind of. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=713.26s)]
*  People have looted. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=715.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, yeah, who knows how much of ancient Egypt is just gone? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=716.7s)]
*  I mean, who knows? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=720.9000000000001s)]
*  Oh, man, so many wealthy people actually ate mummies. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=722.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=725.34s)]
*  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=726.34s)]
*  they actually like for people listening, I did. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=727.34s)]
*  You didn't mishear me. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=729.6600000000001s)]
*  They ate mummies. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=731.34s)]
*  They would bring them to these European aristocrats would bring them to parties and people would [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=732.9000000000001s)]
*  consume the mummies. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=739.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=742.1800000000001s)]
*  Which is just like, what were you guys drinking? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=743.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gnarly, man. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=747.14s)]
*  What kind of ditty party were you guys having over there where that was the idea? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=749.4599999999999s)]
*  It's gnarly, man. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=752.5s)]
*  Yeah, so much of Egypt is gone. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=753.5s)]
*  And this is why I don't think that, you know, like I love the mystery of the ancient world [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=756.38s)]
*  and why I'm so baffled when people want to immediately shut anything down. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=761.8599999999999s)]
*  Because of the amount of history that is lost to us is completely baffling. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=767.54s)]
*  Egypt has been getting looted, we know, for the last, let's say, 3000 years at least, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=772.82s)]
*  countries, foreign nations have been coming in and raiding Egypt and taking the artifacts [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=781.34s)]
*  out and so, you know, so much of the artifact record is lost. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=786.1s)]
*  And I think that the real problem is the confidence with which somebody like Zahi speaks. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=791.3s)]
*  It's okay for you to have your perspective and the way that you view the ancient world [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=797.1s)]
*  based on the data that's been available to you. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=802.22s)]
*  It's okay to have your opinions, but when you're so confident about your opinions that [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=805.0600000000001s)]
*  you then begin to chastise other people, put them down for it, and then go the next mile [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=808.6800000000001s)]
*  and start making accusations of them being a racist and things like that. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=813.9s)]
*  The Flint-Dibble approach. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=818.1800000000001s)]
*  That's really not good. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=820.0600000000001s)]
*  Right, it's not good, but it's like that guy embodies what you don't like about academia. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=821.5s)]
*  You see him physically, he embodies it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=827.86s)]
*  It's like, that's what it is. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=829.38s)]
*  These weak men, these weird, kind of bitchy, weak men that decide that they're in control [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=830.82s)]
*  of things and the way they shut people down is by casting the worst pejoratives on them. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=837.14s)]
*  Especially like the Graham Hancock stuff, calling him a racist. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=841.94s)]
*  Because he's interested in Atlantis. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=845.62s)]
*  I really did not like the letter that they wrote to Netflix to try to get season one [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=848.4200000000001s)]
*  taken down of ancient apocalypse. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=853.1s)]
*  Sometimes they'll rebuttal and say, oh, well, you know, I never blatantly called him a racist. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=855.62s)]
*  Like, well, okay, even if you didn't blatantly do it, you insinuated it and you were okay [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=861.3s)]
*  with insinuating it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=864.6999999999999s)]
*  Some of these people exist in a realm where, in their little bubbles, where they throw [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=866.5s)]
*  around the word racist all the time. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=870.76s)]
*  And then when they get to the wider world where the rest of us exist, they find out [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=873.3399999999999s)]
*  very quickly that we don't throw that term around lightly and accuse people of these [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=877.4599999999999s)]
*  things. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=882.5s)]
*  At the end of the podcast, when he said, you asked, the kind of temperature came down, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=883.7s)]
*  and then I think maybe you asked something like, well, what can people do to help archaeology? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=890.3s)]
*  And he was like, oh, you can donate to the SAA. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=894.54s)]
*  But the SAA is the one that wrote the letter. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=896.94s)]
*  It's like, oh, man, that's just, it's not a good look. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=899.3s)]
*  Well, it's a real problem with human beings and ego when they have positions of power [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=903.82s)]
*  and authority, especially over something that is very esoteric and something that is like, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=910.06s)]
*  and also completely complex. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=916.9599999999999s)]
*  Like when you're dealing with trying to decipher hieroglyphs and trying to, and then, you know, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=919.54s)]
*  the fact that we know that the Library of Alexandria was burned down, so who knows what [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=925.6999999999999s)]
*  was lost in that? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=929.42s)]
*  Several different times, like five different times. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=930.7199999999999s)]
*  God. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=932.9399999999999s)]
*  I wonder if any of that just got stolen out of there and then they blamed it on like, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=933.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, so the first time Caesar is chasing his rival Pompey across the Mediterranean, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=939.1800000000001s)]
*  and Pompey flees to Alexandria. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=946.02s)]
*  And Alexandria was kind of in the basket of Rome. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=948.22s)]
*  The Ptolemies, who are the Greek pharaohs in Egypt, so the Greeks are controlling Egypt [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=953.62s)]
*  after Alexander comes in 332 BC. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=958.98s)]
*  So Alexander dies, his best friend Ptolemy becomes pharaoh. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=961.7s)]
*  But the Ptolemies were very weak, not very good rulers, and so Rome kind of does like [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=965.7s)]
*  what the US does, where they get pulled into conflicts, and then once they're there and [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=970.1400000000001s)]
*  they conquer everything, they seize all the power, you know? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=974.26s)]
*  And so Rome had done this to Egypt, and so they controlled Egypt, and they were pulling [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=976.98s)]
*  all of their, they were keeping the Ptolemies in power, the Roman soldiers were, and they [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=983.0600000000001s)]
*  were pulling all that grain into Egypt. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=987.74s)]
*  And so Caesar follows Pompey, chases him to Alexandria, and so that Caesar can't, or [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=989.9s)]
*  so that Pompey can't flee, Caesar says, we'll burn the docks. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=996.9s)]
*  Well, when you landed in Alexandria, you would land at this dock that went to a road called [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1000.3s)]
*  Soma Road. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1005.54s)]
*  So you had Soma Road and Canopic Way, and it was like the street corner. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1006.54s)]
*  It must have been amazing to see in real life. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1009.6999999999999s)]
*  Like think about this, you have the Library of Alexandria, all this is all in one block. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1011.42s)]
*  You have the Library of Alexandria, you have the Museon, which is right next to it. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1016.74s)]
*  So both together, they make the world's first university. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1020.0600000000001s)]
*  And I mean, you can just imagine like walking through those halls. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1023.02s)]
*  Across the street from that is Alexander's mausoleum. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1026.06s)]
*  So his mausoleum, we think the Emperor Hadrian, if you've heard of Hadrian before, that he [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1029.58s)]
*  modeled his mausoleum on Alexander's. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1035.78s)]
*  So we kind of have an idea of like what the mausoleum looked like. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1038.98s)]
*  You know, we have a marble statue of Alexander on top. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1041.5s)]
*  So people are walking by every day in the middle of this town. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1043.88s)]
*  And then across the street from that is the palatial district where all the rich people [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1046.3200000000002s)]
*  live. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1048.96s)]
*  And then off by the bay, you would have had Cleopatra's Palace. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1049.96s)]
*  And so it's this beautiful place. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1053.0400000000002s)]
*  But when the boats come into the dock, you had to give up all the scrolls that you had, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1054.2800000000002s)]
*  because the Ptolemies are obsessed with obtaining the world's knowledge and they want the originals. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1058.1200000000001s)]
*  They don't want a copy. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1062.16s)]
*  So what they would tell people is you give us your writings, we'll write down a copy, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1063.42s)]
*  and we'll give you back your original. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1069.5800000000002s)]
*  But what they would do is give back the copy and keep the original. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1071.3000000000002s)]
*  And this is something called the Library Wars. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1073.44s)]
*  This is the whole thing. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1075.04s)]
*  But it was connected to the docks. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1078.24s)]
*  And so most of the buildings in Alexandria are made out of stone to prevent fires. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1080.1200000000001s)]
*  But the interior of Alexandria's library would have had all these wooden shelves that would [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1084.6000000000001s)]
*  cross where you'd stack all the scrolls in. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1088.4s)]
*  So everything just, maybe the actual structure of the building doesn't burn down, but the [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1090.3600000000001s)]
*  entire interior of it burns up. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1094.76s)]
*  And so when Caesar sets fire to the docks to burn all of Pompey's ships, it crawls up [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1097.2s)]
*  the docks and burns the library down. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1102.4s)]
*  Well, Augustus did the same thing a decade and a half later. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1104.6000000000001s)]
*  Augustus came and he seized Alexandria. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1111.52s)]
*  And this is where, this is when Cleopatra and Marcantina die. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1113.8400000000001s)]
*  He seizes it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1116.64s)]
*  And then there are rebellions, because the Alexandrians are very rebellious. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1117.48s)]
*  They don't want to be ruled by the Romans. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1120.64s)]
*  And so there's, I think it's Caracalla that he was being made fun of by the Alexandrians. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1124.3200000000002s)]
*  There was a theater in town. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1132.3999999999999s)]
*  It's actually the place where stand-up comedy was invented in Alexandria. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1133.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1137.4399999999998s)]
*  So, and the butt of all the jokes was always the Roman emperor. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1138.4399999999998s)]
*  So you have people like talking shit about the Roman emperor standing up in the middle [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1142.04s)]
*  of Alexandria's theater. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1147.04s)]
*  And so the Roman emperor was always the butt of the joke. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1149.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, Caracalla, I believe it's Caracalla, he's one of the brothers in Gladiator 2, the [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1152.04s)]
*  new Gladiator, if you've seen it. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1157.1599999999999s)]
*  I haven't seen it. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1159.04s)]
*  He's one of the brothers, but the movie doesn't really depict the actual emperors very accurately. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1160.36s)]
*  But he gets tired of it. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1165.1599999999999s)]
*  So he just comes down to Alexandria on like a royal visit and executes 25,000 people in [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1166.1999999999998s)]
*  the city of Alexandria and burns down parts of it. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1172.6s)]
*  So he burned down the library for the third time. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1174.8799999999999s)]
*  And then there was another emperor named Aurelian when a local Alexandrian declared himself [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1177.6s)]
*  the new Egyptian pharaoh. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1183.84s)]
*  I think he was a real Egyptian. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1185.3999999999999s)]
*  He declared himself like the newest pharaoh and he created this revolt. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1187.96s)]
*  And then Aurelian had to come and put the revolt down and he burned down the library [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1193.0s)]
*  again. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1196.2s)]
*  So this is, we're getting close to like 300 AD at this point. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1197.2s)]
*  Now in 365 AD, there was a huge earthquake that was off of the coast of Crete, I think, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1200.16s)]
*  which is the most southern Greek isle. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1210.48s)]
*  It's where the Minoans lived. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1213.1200000000001s)]
*  I believe it's there. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1214.48s)]
*  Or it's off the coast of Cyprus. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1215.48s)]
*  And so that earthquake like just reverberates down to Egypt in this massive tsunami, destroys [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1217.32s)]
*  the entire city of Alexandria. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1223.6s)]
*  And it said it was so catastrophic that I think it's plenty of the elder or plenty of [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1225.2s)]
*  the younger comes down in a rescue mission from Italy and he comes to Alexandria and [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1231.1599999999999s)]
*  he records that 50,000 people in the city are missing because of the wave that gets [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1235.36s)]
*  pushed in and that all of the giant boats, these are giant, gigantic boats in Alexandria's [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1240.84s)]
*  harbor, are sitting on top of all the rooftops in the city. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1247.12s)]
*  And it's after this point that the location of Alexander's body and the location of Alexandria's [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1251.08s)]
*  library just completely go missing. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1256.6799999999998s)]
*  So they're both utterly destroyed and most likely all of the giant stones that were used [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1259.9199999999998s)]
*  to build the city were repurposed for other things. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1264.76s)]
*  But in one fail swoop, Alexandria's library, the museum and Alexander's mausoleum completely [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1268.04s)]
*  disappear from the historical record. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1274.7199999999998s)]

*  He just has these amazing experiences. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1490.72s)]
*  Ah man, he would be like your best, like your all-time guest. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1493.1200000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1496.92s)]
*  You could have him on. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1497.92s)]
*  Sure. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1498.92s)]
*  But I get a great accent too. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1499.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1501.5200000000002s)]
*  For sure. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1502.5200000000002s)]
*  And so you listen to his audiobook and the way he talks about meeting the indigenous [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1503.84s)]
*  people that live deep in the Amazon. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1510.8799999999999s)]
*  It would take him weeks to get to these little villages. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1512.48s)]
*  And while he was out there, he would see the systematic mathematical structure with which [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1515.6799999999998s)]
*  they would set up these giant villages and how they would build these huge thatch wood [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1521.72s)]
*  homes with foundations that are stones. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1527.02s)]
*  And these people were... [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1529.76s)]
*  He said that they had beautiful skin, they spoke elegantly, they sang songs. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1530.76s)]
*  And he was like, he's like, these people in the Amazon are not primitive savages like [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1535.12s)]
*  my colleagues at the Royal Geographic Society in London believe that they are. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1541.52s)]
*  These are people who are the descendants of a fallen great civilization. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1547.64s)]
*  He was like, the way they interact with each other is so sophisticated. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1553.32s)]
*  Why did he think they were the descendants of a fallen civilization and not the... [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1556.16s)]
*  The people that were currently living in the most modern version of the civilization? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1561.24s)]
*  I don't quite know. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1569.64s)]
*  There's some things that are left out. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1571.48s)]
*  He has some... [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1574.16s)]
*  Before he started writing this, I think he always had these ideas in the back of his [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1575.56s)]
*  mind. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1579.0s)]
*  And so you don't really get the origin of why he initially started thinking this. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1580.0s)]
*  While he's exploring South America, he's hearing all these stories of semi-contacted people. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1584.4s)]
*  You have natives who still live the native life, but they can speak Spanish. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1591.44s)]
*  And he can speak a little bit of Spanish and communicate with these people. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1595.96s)]
*  So he would hear about, oh yeah, there's this huge city of gold off in the jungle, months [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1598.6s)]
*  traveled that way. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1605.76s)]
*  And it's the same kind of legend that all these Spaniards had heard. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1607.0s)]
*  So it's this idea of there was this civilization that used to be out there. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1609.24s)]
*  And so Percy thought that maybe it has something to do with Atlantis. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1614.0s)]
*  And so that was part of his journey looking for it. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1618.0800000000002s)]
*  And then he... [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1621.2s)]
*  It's actually his wife, Nina Fossett, I believe. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1622.44s)]
*  When she's in a library in England, she finds a Portuguese document. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1625.0800000000002s)]
*  I think it's manuscript 512. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1631.0s)]
*  Have you ever heard of this? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1632.48s)]
*  I could have the name of it wrong, but I think it's manuscript 512. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1635.28s)]
*  And in that, it's these guys who are kind of like semi-professional Portuguese explorers [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1638.12s)]
*  in the mid 1700s that are going around Brazil. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1644.84s)]
*  And they find this huge stone city with statues that they thought looked like Greek gods in [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1648.84s)]
*  the middle of the Amazon. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1654.8799999999999s)]
*  And so the perception, like my perception looking back through it is like, well, I mean, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1656.4799999999998s)]
*  yeah, these are Portuguese guys who come from Europe. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1660.0s)]
*  So when they see something that's native, their only lens to see it through is what [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1662.08s)]
*  they've grown up knowing, which is the Greek and Roman world. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1666.28s)]
*  So that's how they communicate this idea. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1669.1200000000001s)]
*  But they found this big stone city in the middle of, I think it's... [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1671.02s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's Brazil's jungle. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1675.44s)]
*  And so this was completely forgotten until Percy's wife found this. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1677.2s)]
*  So when he first went down to the Amazon, he was only there on a mapping expedition [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1681.88s)]
*  on behalf of Great Britain, which he was probably a spy. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1686.52s)]
*  I'm guessing that that's what was actually happening there because he was a spy when [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1691.4s)]
*  he was in the military. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1694.4s)]
*  And I think what he was doing is on an official basis, he's charting the border around Brazil [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1695.5600000000002s)]
*  with the Amazon River. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1702.16s)]
*  But really what he's doing is collecting information so that maybe Great Britain can have a colony [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1703.8400000000001s)]
*  there someday. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1707.44s)]
*  But then the war disrupts all of that. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1708.44s)]
*  And he has to go fight in World War I, which is funny because it's the same thing the Nazis [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1712.0s)]
*  were doing in the 1930s. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1717.2s)]
*  Anyways, so while he's there on his first expedition, he doesn't initially... [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1719.04s)]
*  I think he's interested in these ideas of ancient history, but it's when he's there [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1725.92s)]
*  and he's off in the jungle, he's finding all these artifacts on the ground. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1729.4s)]
*  And he's like, the way that the pottery... [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1732.64s)]
*  There's clay pottery and then there's stone vessels and eating utensils that he was finding, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1735.84s)]
*  really elegant little statues and things. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1742.52s)]
*  He found one that was made out of this solid black stone that he could never... [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1746.24s)]
*  And it had this glow to it. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1749.08s)]
*  And he could never... [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1751.04s)]
*  Maybe not a glow, but like... [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1752.04s)]
*  Like if you shine the light on it, you can tell that it's translucent in a way. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1754.64s)]
*  I've seen stones like this in the Aztec realm. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1758.8s)]
*  They have these scepters that have these orb things on the top. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1761.52s)]
*  And if you shine a light on it, it's like this otherworldly looking thing. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1764.24s)]
*  I can only imagine if you're on peyote. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1767.0s)]
*  Where is the stone? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1768.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1769.84s)]
*  And it's missing now. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1770.84s)]
*  It's lost. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1771.84s)]
*  Maybe it went missing with him or somewhere in his expeditions that doesn't exist anymore. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1773.1999999999998s)]
*  But there's an illustration of it in Exploration Fossa that you could find. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1776.52s)]
*  And so he thought, like when he was seeing all this on his first expedition, he's like, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1781.24s)]
*  wait, these aren't these primitive savages that all my colleagues that I don't even like [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1784.8s)]
*  back home think that these people are. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1789.36s)]
*  This is an advanced culture. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1792.1599999999999s)]
*  There's something that's lost here. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1793.9199999999998s)]
*  And so Percy didn't know if it was a fallen civilization that lived in the Amazon or whether [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1795.56s)]
*  it was still out there somewhere. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1800.0s)]
*  And he was trying to find either the ruins of it or the living city. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1801.16s)]
*  So he didn't really know if it was fallen or not. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1805.88s)]
*  It's still interesting that he would think that way instead of this is the pinnacle of [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1808.8s)]
*  civilization in the Amazon, which is why they're so advanced. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1813.56s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1816.76s)]
*  Is that like a preconceived notion that he had that there was an advanced civilization [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1817.76s)]
*  and that it had fallen? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1821.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1822.76s)]
*  Because if you're looking at the way the people were living, the way he's describing it, it [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1823.76s)]
*  sounds pretty advanced. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1826.44s)]
*  Sure. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1827.44s)]
*  But wouldn't you assume that these people had lived for thousands of years and eventually [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1828.88s)]
*  risen to this current level? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1833.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1834.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1835.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1836.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1837.92s)]
*  That's the problem with preconceived notions, too. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1838.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1839.92s)]
*  But I do know that he had the utmost admiration and respect for these people. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1840.92s)]
*  He was completely infatuated with their way of life and trying to, you know, what his [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1845.0800000000002s)]
*  His goal was to prove that the narrow-minded perspective of the English aristocrats who [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1850.52s)]
*  thought that they were the pinnacle of civilization, he was determined to prove them wrong. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1858.96s)]
*  And so he had a great admiration for these people. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1863.8s)]
*  And he wanted to try to find a big, big civilization, something with enough people that could rival [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1867.12s)]
*  Europe. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1874.92s)]
*  And where he went missing was in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1876.1599999999999s)]
*  And the last place that they know that he was at was on May 29, 1925. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1882.32s)]
*  And he wrote a letter to his wife from Dead Horse Camp. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1886.84s)]
*  And he was like, it may be a while before you hear from me. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1888.9199999999998s)]
*  It could be up to a year or two before you hear from me. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1891.28s)]
*  I'm about to head into a very dense area. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1893.08s)]
*  And my trail runners who would, you know, go back and forth with his notes, they weren't [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1895.6399999999999s)]
*  going to follow him out there because it's too dangerous. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1899.2399999999998s)]
*  And that was the last letter that he had written. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1901.78s)]
*  And he was going, he was heading off into what's called the Zingu region, which is like [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1904.48s)]
*  the Zingu River. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1909.64s)]
*  And it's one of the most hostile regions in the Amazon. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1910.92s)]
*  Maybe even today, Teddy Roosevelt had trouble when he went there. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1914.76s)]
*  But the Zingu region is where all of the major lidar came out within the last 10 years. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1919.6200000000001s)]
*  They found all the ruins of these giant cities. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1925.48s)]
*  And there's a city called Kiriguyu, I think. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1928.52s)]
*  It had an estimated population of about a million people, which is the size of Rome. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1932.2s)]
*  And you know, when you look at the lidar images, you can't get a perspective of how big they [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1938.3600000000001s)]
*  are. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1943.3600000000001s)]
*  I have access to a lidar database of the entire United States. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1944.3600000000001s)]
*  And I've mapped all kinds of huge uncharted mound sites in Florida, all of the southeast. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1947.48s)]
*  I have hundreds of sites marked. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1954.64s)]
*  And when you first look at them on a map, you're like, oh, okay, like maybe that looks [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1956.8400000000001s)]
*  like it's 50 feet long or something. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1960.84s)]
*  No, they'll be like 300 yards long, like these giant raised platforms in the middle of the [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1962.72s)]
*  forest here in the US. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1968.08s)]
*  And if I had access to lidar data like that, where I could measure it down on the Amazon, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1970.1999999999998s)]
*  some of these things are miles long, like raised platforms are a mile long. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1974.1599999999999s)]
*  And they have highways. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1978.9199999999998s)]
*  Maybe we should pull up just an image of a lidar scan from the Amazon. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1981.28s)]
*  But you'll see this central city area. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1985.8s)]
*  You'll see step pyramids and raised platforms. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1989.84s)]
*  Maybe this is where people lived or maybe this is where the market was. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1992.56s)]
*  And there will be a road that cuts straight through it. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1995.1599999999999s)]
*  And you can see the road just goes off in the distance for miles and miles and miles. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=1997.1s)]
*  And so what they would do. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2000.9599999999998s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2002.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, this is so this is one of these sites in this one of these sites. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2003.9599999999998s)]
*  I believe this is in Brazil or maybe it's in northeast Bolivia. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2007.84s)]
*  And is all that area covered completely with jungle right now? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2010.76s)]
*  Completely covered in jungle. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2013.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2014.9399999999998s)]
*  So if you went out there, you wouldn't see any of this. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2015.9399999999998s)]
*  You may not realize that you were standing on a mound like you really got to train your [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2017.32s)]
*  eyes. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2021.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, I put out this I filmed this little series about a year and a half ago called [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2022.8799999999999s)]
*  Jungle of Stone, where I was going through the jungles in Central America and we charted [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2027.04s)]
*  this city that had 16 pyramids in it. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2032.12s)]
*  You know, we were there all day long and we charted 16 pyramids. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2035.8799999999999s)]
*  And when I put it out, I got all these comments are like, you're not doing anything but walking [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2038.9199999999998s)]
*  on a bunch of hills because it's so hard to see it. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2041.84s)]
*  The jungle just claims everything back. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2044.4399999999998s)]
*  So it takes you really have to sit with seeing these things in person for a while before [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2046.68s)]
*  you start recognizing, oh, that is a mound or that is a pyramid. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2051.64s)]
*  That is a structure under the jungle. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2054.32s)]
*  And so Percy Fawcett, he where where that LiDAR came out is one of the places that he [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2056.08s)]
*  told his wife. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2061.16s)]
*  He didn't share this publicly where where he thought that the city was, but it's it's [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2062.16s)]
*  like bang on. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2065.36s)]
*  He was he was exactly correct about where he thought a city would be. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2066.56s)]
*  And we don't know if he reached it or not. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2070.12s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2072.6800000000003s)]
*  It's so interesting because how long has LiDAR been around for? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2074.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2078.4s)]
*  And how long has it been used? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2079.4s)]
*  I mean, think about for how long people had no idea that this existed because it was completely [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2080.4s)]
*  covered with jungle. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2085.84s)]
*  They just assume that there was evidence of a civilization to be pretty obvious. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2087.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2090.84s)]
*  It's not. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2091.84s)]
*  And it makes me wonder, like as technology increases in its potential, like what other [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2092.84s)]
*  new technologies will be discovered that will allow you to instead of like having this ambiguous [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2097.4s)]
*  view of under the pyramids and have like a crystal clear, like accurate dimension by [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2102.94s)]
*  dimension, almost like a 3D map. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2109.1800000000003s)]
*  This century for sure. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2112.58s)]
*  This century is going to be insane. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2114.1400000000003s)]
*  It's going to be insane. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2115.78s)]
*  Like you're going to have everyone scanning everything. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2116.78s)]
*  All of the Amazon will be mapped with LiDAR. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2119.86s)]
*  By the end of the century, all of the Sahara is going to be mapped with LiDAR by the end [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2122.9s)]
*  of the century. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2126.1400000000003s)]
*  The Sahara is a big one. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2127.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2128.42s)]
*  Well, those are my two. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2129.42s)]
*  Those are my two big things. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2130.42s)]
*  We talk about Atlantis and we talk about lost civilizations. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2131.42s)]
*  I mean, my thing is the Sahara and the Amazon. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2134.62s)]
*  Both of these things existed pre-Ice Age, especially if we're talking about pre-Ice [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2140.7400000000002s)]
*  Age civilization. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2143.78s)]
*  The Sahara is an oasis, 10,000 plus years ago. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2144.78s)]
*  It's an oasis. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2150.08s)]
*  You have what, two or three of the world's largest lake systems on there. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2151.08s)]
*  You have rivers everywhere. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2154.9s)]
*  It would have been like a beautiful place to live. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2156.38s)]
*  Abundant resources, so there's no worry about food and shelter. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2160.06s)]
*  You have plenty of time to figure things out, which is the thing that has always made sense [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2164.1400000000003s)]
*  to me if you know the history of the Nile Valley and where Egypt was. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2168.3s)]
*  That was a wonderful place to live to try to figure things out, right? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2173.1800000000003s)]
*  Because you have so much food. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2177.5s)]
*  Once you have so much food and you're kind of separated from everybody, it's really tough [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2178.5s)]
*  to get to you. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2181.94s)]
*  They lived unchallenged in that civilization for thousands of years. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2184.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's amazing. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2189.54s)]
*  And you know, growing up, I mean, gosh, I read Fingerprints of the Gods when I was 16. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2191.54s)]
*  I remember sitting on the couch after school and reading it. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2198.94s)]
*  And my dad comes up to me, he's like, that's a big book. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2201.8199999999997s)]
*  And I go, I know. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2204.02s)]
*  It's like I'm reading a textbook for fun. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2205.02s)]
*  And it was dense reading for me as a 16-year-old. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2206.8199999999997s)]
*  And so I was so inspired by Graham. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2210.74s)]
*  And then I went off and got traditionally educated. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2214.14s)]
*  So I kind of have both of these perspectives. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2218.3599999999997s)]
*  And I'm often shocked and disappointed at how other professional archaeologists and anthropologists [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2220.08s)]
*  explain popular mysteries. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2226.48s)]
*  Like there was an Egyptologist on another popular podcast. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2230.7999999999997s)]
*  And the podcast host asked him to properly explain the mystery around the pyramid. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2235.12s)]
*  And it was just so subpar, I was shocked. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2240.7599999999998s)]
*  And I was like, I'm not even an Egyptologist. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2242.9199999999996s)]
*  I know how to explain these things. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2244.6s)]
*  And I felt the same way about Zahi. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2245.84s)]
*  Maybe there's some kind of language barrier there. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2248.1200000000003s)]
*  But it was also like he didn't want to explain these things on a basic level. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2249.8s)]
*  But one of the things that I never see talked about is the concentration of energy along [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2254.6800000000003s)]
*  the Nile Valley. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2259.88s)]
*  Like OK, so if I had to drop a pin anywhere on the earth where I think Atlantis would [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2261.6000000000004s)]
*  be, I would probably put it in the Sahara somewhere, along one of these major lakes [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2268.2000000000003s)]
*  where there's a lot of people living at one time. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2273.8s)]
*  And then later on, as the Sahara dries up, say beginning around like 8,000 BC, it starts [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2276.2400000000002s)]
*  rapidly drying up. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2284.44s)]
*  It's probably a little bit before that. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2285.44s)]
*  And then by about 4,000 BC, it's completely dry. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2286.8s)]
*  So your Saharans only have a few places that they can go. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2289.1800000000003s)]
*  They can go to the Mediterranean coast. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2292.44s)]
*  They can go to the Atlantic coast. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2294.5200000000004s)]
*  They can go down kind of into the Congo and in the savannas. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2295.5200000000004s)]
*  Or they can go to this fertile valley oasis where it's like 500 yards on each side where [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2298.96s)]
*  it's just completely lush tropical oasis. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2304.8s)]
*  And so some people went there. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2308.6s)]
*  And so you have this hyper concentration of energy and all these people living somewhere [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2310.94s)]
*  together for what we know is the first time in history. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2315.56s)]
*  Like we can verify it, I guess, if that makes sense. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2318.88s)]
*  And so rather than being able to have these huge pieces of property where they can all [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2322.8s)]
*  live separated from each other, kind of like in the Sahara, you have all this space and [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2327.3599999999997s)]
*  so luxurious. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2330.6s)]
*  Now you have to live on top of each other and you have to build up these cities. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2331.92s)]
*  You're like building cities. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2336.44s)]
*  And so all that energy compacted into one place in this fertile oasis is either destined [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2338.08s)]
*  to completely crumble and fall apart or it's New York City. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2343.04s)]
*  It's this thin strip of highly concentrated, genius, hardworking people figuring out how [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2347.48s)]
*  to extrapolate the most out of their natural world and create some of the greatest things [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2354.7599999999998s)]
*  the world has ever seen. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2358.56s)]
*  Just like New York City, we did it. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2360.7799999999997s)]
*  And I've never seen any Egyptologist explain things that way. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2363.24s)]
*  I think that's a good explanation at least. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2369.2799999999997s)]
*  And I'm open to things in Egypt being much older, like the Sphinx is definitely older [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2371.2s)]
*  than the pyramids. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2374.52s)]
*  But I'm just always disappointed at the very low level with which archaeologists and anthropologists [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2376.68s)]
*  will come in and try to explain things to a popular audience. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2384.22s)]
*  And it's kind of like you were asking, okay, but how do you know that? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2386.3799999999997s)]
*  Explain that to me in a way that I can understand. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2389.66s)]
*  How do you know this? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2392.2599999999998s)]
*  And then there's never a proper explanation. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2393.2599999999998s)]
*  And I don't know what that is. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2394.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like they strongly dislike the fact that there's mystery out there and that there are [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2396.8999999999996s)]
*  other people who are attempting to answer the mystery that are not part of the Good [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2404.66s)]
*  Boys Club. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2407.9599999999996s)]
*  So they have this knee-jerk reaction to it all. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2409.54s)]
*  They hate all of it. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2412.5s)]
*  They want to be a part of all of it. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2413.58s)]
*  And that's not going to work going forward. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2415.18s)]
*  Not to be political, but this recent election showed that you're going to have to appeal [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2419.7s)]
*  to the popular audience in the future. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2424.24s)]
*  Everyone is. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2426.8s)]
*  Yeah, and especially when there's these forums now like YouTube where someone like you can [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2427.8s)]
*  put up videos explaining things or Jimmy Corsetti or Graham Hancock. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2432.7s)]
*  The access to people to share fascinating ideas, it's not limited to universities anymore. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2438.22s)]
*  And I think that drives them crazy because they spent so much time being in control. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2445.3799999999997s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it's just like... [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2450.66s)]
*  And then through a lot of these appearances like Flint Dibble and Zahi, their credibility [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2453.74s)]
*  erodes publicly in front of everyone's eyes. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2458.2999999999997s)]
*  And then there's people that are going to support both of them on either side. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2462.18s)]
*  Who knows how much of it is even real? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2466.3s)]
*  Because now we have AI bots and they get turned loose by whether it's universities like the [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2468.0200000000004s)]
*  University of Zurich that just got in trouble for running that experiment with social media, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2474.1400000000003s)]
*  which is really wild. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2477.98s)]
*  So we don't even know how much of it is organic until you see something like voting. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2478.98s)]
*  And then you go, oh, this is how people really feel. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2484.9s)]
*  But how much of that has even been influenced by all these AI campaigns? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2487.1400000000003s)]
*  What we do know is that human arrogance has always been a real problem. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2492.66s)]
*  And the same thing that Percy Foster was probably dealing with, or Percy Fosser rather, was [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2496.62s)]
*  probably dealing with when he was, you know, the people back home that thought these people [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2500.42s)]
*  were primitive. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2504.54s)]
*  It's like this arrogance that human beings... [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2505.54s)]
*  Looking down their nose at everybody else. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2507.54s)]
*  People love to be experts. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2508.78s)]
*  They love to be experts and they love to... [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2510.66s)]
*  And they also equate their own self-worth with being accurate about information that [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2513.46s)]
*  you really can't be accurate about. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2518.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2520.38s)]
*  So they love just being humble, but yet knowledgeable, which is a great position. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2521.38s)]
*  When you talk to someone and they're humble and knowledgeable, that's a... [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2526.54s)]
*  Those are my favorite conversations because they'll tell you what they know and what they [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2529.9s)]
*  don't know and this is why. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2533.54s)]
*  Archaeologists are not doing that, which is why they're rejecting people like Graham Hancock. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2535.38s)]
*  What they should be doing is embracing the work that he's doing because he's self-funded [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2539.42s)]
*  and because he's just selling books and doing his thing and appearing on podcasts and... [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2546.3s)]
*  Developing this audience. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2552.1000000000004s)]
*  He's allowed to do all these fantastic voyages. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2553.9s)]
*  He's in Iraq right now, like studying the ancient Sumerian civilization with a remanence [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2558.58s)]
*  of it. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2564.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2565.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, there's two things I'd say there. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2566.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, kind of like, I guess, a running theme of this is we're about to enter into [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2568.78s)]
*  like archaeological Wild West in a way. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2572.7000000000003s)]
*  I think that, you know, Jimmy getting involved with Gobekli Tepe and the trees that were [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2577.34s)]
*  there, having the trees, the orchards planted over the sites. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2584.5s)]
*  And they're removing them now. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2587.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2588.26s)]
*  Because of him. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2589.26s)]
*  It's just proof that a guy... [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2590.26s)]
*  I started watching Jimmy 2018. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2592.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, gosh, I just graduated from high school. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2594.06s)]
*  And so he was kind of like inspired me to be like, you know, he was this young, charismatic [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2598.78s)]
*  that could go online and research topics and enthusiastically present these topics. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2603.3s)]
*  And he was effective at doing it and inspired me for a long time. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2609.2200000000003s)]
*  And lo and behold, I guess what, six, seven years later, he's still at it. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2613.42s)]
*  And he's actually not just inspired people to be interested in the ancient world, but [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2618.78s)]
*  had an actual effect on something on the opposite side of the planet. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2623.3s)]
*  Like when all this happened, I was like, yeah, I mean, I get the concern, but I don't think [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2626.7000000000003s)]
*  the Turkish government cares what any of us over here in the US think. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2630.9s)]
*  Sure enough, they removed the trees. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2635.02s)]
*  And then there's kind of like the backpedaling of, oh, well, it was always in the plan to [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2636.34s)]
*  remove the trees. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2639.82s)]
*  But I think people might disagree with Jimmy's approach, whatever. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2640.82s)]
*  But you can't deny the fact that he himself, an independent guy, was able to make so much [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2646.34s)]
*  noise that he affected a government on the opposite side of the planet. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2652.46s)]
*  And in a way, it shows me, oh, these expeditions that I'm planning and things that I'm going [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2657.38s)]
*  to go out and survey and document for myself, these can make real changes. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2664.46s)]
*  And these are things I have planned in Florida, here in the Southeast, in the States, in Central [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2668.74s)]
*  America, and in the Amazon. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2673.86s)]
*  And it's encouraging. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2675.14s)]
*  Wow, we're really approaching a time when independent people are going to start making [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2676.14s)]
*  real noticeable differences, and not just in the digital space that people are interested in. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2683.1s)]
*  Right, but in the physical archaeology world. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2687.3799999999997s)]
*  Exactly, exactly, yeah. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2689.2999999999997s)]
*  Jimmy's so meticulous, too. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2690.2999999999997s)]
*  He's such a good representative because he's really intelligent, really thought-provoking, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2691.8999999999996s)]
*  but also really honest about what he knows and what he doesn't know. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2697.8199999999997s)]
*  And he has counterarguments to his own points. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2701.46s)]
*  He'll tell you something, but also it could be this. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2704.22s)]
*  And this is what we know. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2708.14s)]
*  Because he's been really careful in the way he expresses himself, he's established this [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2709.58s)]
*  community that understands what he does, and they trust him. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2716.7799999999997s)]
*  And they go, no, no, no, he's going to tell you the truth. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2720.66s)]
*  He's going to tell you what we know and why we know it. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2723.3799999999997s)]
*  He's not going to make any weird ideological leaps. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2725.74s)]
*  He's not going to make any weird judgments. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2727.94s)]
*  He's just going to lay out what is fascinating about these things. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2730.2599999999998s)]
*  Because of that, whether he has a degree or not a degree, that guy's having a massive [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2735.7400000000002s)]
*  impact. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2741.06s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how many... [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2742.06s)]
*  Yeah, nobody can deny that. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2743.06s)]
*  What does Bright Insights YouTube channel have for subscribers? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2744.06s)]
*  By the way, if you haven't watched any of his videos, can't recommend them enough. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2748.06s)]
*  Love the guy, love the stuff. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2752.06s)]
*  1.7. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2754.06s)]
*  1.7. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2755.06s)]
*  By the way, he's been called a Nazi. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2756.06s)]
*  Which is, that's just, that's what they use. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2759.94s)]
*  These are the terms. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2763.7s)]
*  He's been called all sorts of terrible things. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2764.7s)]
*  None of them are true. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2767.3999999999996s)]
*  He's a wonderful guy. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2768.3999999999996s)]
*  And he's just a man who's deeply fascinated with these mysteries. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2769.8999999999996s)]
*  And when he's pointing out the things that we cannot... [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2774.3799999999997s)]
*  It's Balbeck in Lebanon, the trillion... [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2778.46s)]
*  What they call the trillion stones? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2781.66s)]
*  Trilithon stones. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2782.66s)]
*  Trilithon stones. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2783.66s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2784.66s)]
*  There's certain things that you can point out that people go, okay, what the fuck? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2785.66s)]
*  He gets to the what the fuck stuff, where everybody's like, okay, what else you got? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2790.14s)]
*  How come I didn't know this? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2795.2599999999998s)]
*  How come this isn't something... [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2796.7s)]
*  When you're talking about ancient history, the history of... [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2798.2599999999998s)]
*  Whether it's Lebanon or Egypt, and when they start talking about these things and they [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2801.2599999999998s)]
*  lay out the histories of the pharaohs, why aren't you talking about the distance? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2805.18s)]
*  They carry these fucking enormous 80-ton rocks through the mountains and how they cut them. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2812.62s)]
*  That's the mystery. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2820.2999999999997s)]
*  This is the big piece of evidence that these guys just want to dismiss. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2821.74s)]
*  Oh, it was the national project. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2826.22s)]
*  Okay, yeah, but that doesn't say how you did that 5,000 years ago. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2828.8199999999997s)]
*  You need to help me out here. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2834.2599999999998s)]
*  And when these openings exist and guys like Jimmy run through them but meticulously document [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2836.2999999999997s)]
*  things and talk about them with humility and talk about them with a general understanding [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2841.8599999999997s)]
*  of the absolute undeniable facts, and then it creates this enormous audience. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2846.9s)]
*  And then because of that enormous audience, it has a huge impact on actual archaeology. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2853.5s)]
*  And that's why they hate him. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2858.2200000000003s)]
*  It's just because he's doing their job better than they're doing their job because he's [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2859.7000000000003s)]
*  not trapped. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2864.76s)]
*  He's not stuck in this compartmentalized ideological position of working for a university. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2867.02s)]
*  And he doesn't have to worry about funding. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2874.66s)]
*  And he doesn't have to worry about being chastised by his peers because they're all a bunch of [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2876.42s)]
*  bitches. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2880.78s)]
*  He doesn't have to worry about that. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2881.66s)]
*  So he's free. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2882.74s)]
*  And there's a bunch of those guys that are emerging now, and guys like yourself. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2884.42s)]
*  And I think that's really important because the gatekeepers have been wrong every step [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2888.5s)]
*  of the way with almost everything, whether it's medical science, whether it's health [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2894.02s)]
*  and nutrition, whatever it is. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2898.14s)]
*  They've been wrong every damn step of the way. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2900.98s)]
*  So maybe open it up. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2903.74s)]
*  Just like the internet opened up information to everybody, we need to open up the exploration [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2905.8999999999996s)]
*  of information to everybody and not have it contained with a few people that have degrees [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2910.62s)]
*  from places that we know are ideologically captured. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2915.2599999999998s)]
*  We can see how they behave. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2918.58s)]
*  We can see the things they say and the way they do things and the way they act and the [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2920.74s)]
*  way, even the way they affect enrollment based on race and gender and sexual preference. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2925.1s)]
*  You guys are fucking crazy. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2930.74s)]
*  This is not how you're supposed to handle knowledge and information. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2932.86s)]
*  This is a dumb approach. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2936.5s)]
*  And we see that through basically every place where there's a few group of people, this [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2938.78s)]
*  isolated, insulated group of people that has the ultimate influence over whatever particular [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2944.38s)]
*  field of study is their specialty. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2951.3s)]
*  It's just a danger that the human ego and the human mind fall prey to almost every single [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2953.94s)]
*  time. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2961.62s)]
*  The internet, what it's done is it's like this great equalizer. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2962.8199999999997s)]
*  And it's just it is it is allowed people to have these. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2966.8199999999997s)]
*  And you hear a lot of people saying you shouldn't do this. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2970.46s)]
*  You shouldn't be doing this. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2972.98s)]
*  Don't do your own research. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2973.8599999999997s)]
*  And those are stupid sayings. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2975.22s)]
*  Like you can't think like that. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2978.02s)]
*  You're going to be people that say things that are absolutely ludicrous. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2979.74s)]
*  And you have to be able to listen to them and then listen to people that are more intelligent [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2983.5s)]
*  and more rational and also objective and go that guy is that's what I'm interested in. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2987.98s)]
*  I'm interested in this guy. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2994.1s)]
*  I know he's not going to lie. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2995.1s)]
*  And there's too many instances of archaeologists just lying, lying and attacking each other [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=2997.22s)]
*  when one of them like clothes first like that. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3003.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3006.1s)]
*  Well, attacking each other. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3007.1s)]
*  I mean, I just experienced this the other day. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3008.1s)]
*  So I had a I guess being early on in my career, I'm passionate about so many different things [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3011.7s)]
*  and I'm the kind of person that's like, oh, I'm passionate about this. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3017.82s)]
*  This is what I'm going to do. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3020.3s)]
*  And so I applied to the University of Athens in Greece and I was really into the classics [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3021.42s)]
*  and I was going to go for that. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3026.78s)]
*  And then I just had this let's just say I was in the jungle and I had a mind opening [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3028.82s)]
*  experience and I was reminded of the fact that my purpose here, the reason I started [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3033.42s)]
*  doing all this was continuing kind of like my family's legacy. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3038.48s)]
*  And I'm interested in a lot of different things. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3042.86s)]
*  And I'm not I'm not going to specialize. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3045.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to like hunker down in this academic path or whatever. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3046.66s)]
*  And so I just decided I'm not going to go through this. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3049.58s)]
*  So I start publishing content in my research on the Americas again. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3053.18s)]
*  And in the Americas are very mysterious. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3059.74s)]
*  It's I mean, very comparable to Egypt. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3062.54s)]
*  It was just in the amount of questions that haven't been answered is insane. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3065.62s)]
*  And the old micro world is fascinating. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3069.66s)]
*  And so, you know, there's a, you know, Graham in in Fingerprints of the Gods, he talks [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3071.7s)]
*  about how the the the Olmecs, he thought that they may have like like like African features. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3078.14s)]
*  And of course, that was 1995. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3083.8599999999997s)]
*  And so I don't know, 2015, you guys are talking and he's like, he's like, well, you know, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3085.62s)]
*  I published that then. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3090.7799999999997s)]
*  But DNA research has come out that says that these people don't have African DNA in them [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3091.8999999999996s)]
*  and that maybe this is Polynesian, maybe this is Australasian people intermixing. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3096.4199999999996s)]
*  And that's why they have this unique look, whatever. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3100.58s)]
*  But in the old world, there's this monument that is actually called El Negro. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3102.7799999999997s)]
*  And you look at it and it's not an old man. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3107.7799999999997s)]
*  It is an African man. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3110.06s)]
*  And so I post about this on my ex account and I just kind of like list everything I've [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3112.62s)]
*  seen in the old world. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3116.62s)]
*  And I'm like, you know, this is really fascinating. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3117.62s)]
*  Maybe this is evidence of Africans who were in who were in the old world. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3119.2599999999998s)]
*  And I hadn't seen this monument before I saw it in person because you go in the old in [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3123.18s)]
*  the old Mac realm in the region in Mexico and you go to these museums and you look at [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3127.34s)]
*  the log or the ledger that people have been on and nobody nobody has visited this museum [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3131.78s)]
*  in the last four months. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3136.7000000000003s)]
*  And before that, it was six months before that. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3137.7000000000003s)]
*  And these monuments just kind of sit underneath these metal roofs to protect them from the [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3140.42s)]
*  rain. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3144.7400000000002s)]
*  And it's like this just this completely lost civilization. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3145.7400000000002s)]
*  Is there an image of this that's available on one? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3148.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3150.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3151.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3152.98s)]
*  There we go. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3153.98s)]
*  There we go. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3154.98s)]
*  You'll see that these guys are very different looking, especially if you can get. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3156.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3159.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3160.62s)]
*  There we go. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3161.62s)]
*  Look at. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3162.62s)]
*  OK. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3163.62s)]
*  So that's yeah. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3164.62s)]
*  OK. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3165.62s)]
*  So that's a regular old Mac head. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3166.62s)]
*  So you can see that these are two different races of people. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3167.62s)]
*  You know, the old Macs have very soft features, round faces, big eyes, big lips, kind of big [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3171.02s)]
*  noses. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3177.3s)]
*  They have very soft features. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3178.3s)]
*  And this El Negro monument has these high cheekbones, this defined jaw line, this intense [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3179.3s)]
*  a lot of variety just in like, let's just say, Italians. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3185.14s)]
*  There's a lot of variety. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3188.42s)]
*  So couldn't this just be someone who's on a spectrum of features that I mean, I don't [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3190.42s)]
*  think it's that much different than you don't think so. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3196.38s)]
*  Well, no, when I'm looking at it, I could I mean, I could imagine like there's like [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3198.66s)]
*  I said, just, you know, my nationality, Italian. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3202.9s)]
*  So there's Italians with very thin faces and there's these big, thick ones. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3205.5s)]
*  And like, people vary quite a bit. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3209.9s)]
*  There's enough similarities that I could say, oh, those could be the same people. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3212.54s)]
*  Well, the only counter I give to that is when you when you visit the old Mac realm, you [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3215.4599999999996s)]
*  see a lot more than just the heads. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3219.3399999999997s)]
*  You see a lot of old Mac faces, dozens and dozens and dozens of them, maybe well over [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3221.4599999999996s)]
*  100. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3225.66s)]
*  And when you've seen them all and you kind of get a gist of like the way they generally [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3226.66s)]
*  look, this guy will really stand out. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3230.7s)]
*  Like I took a group of students there and we all as soon as we all came in and saw it [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3233.1s)]
*  based on everything we'd been seeing for the past week, it immediately stood out to us. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3238.1s)]
*  Well, certainly the thick brow is unique. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3241.78s)]
*  Well, in the are wearing helmets in that that that hair as well. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3244.34s)]
*  It's kind of that it's kind of that curly hair and or at least it looks like it to me. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3249.02s)]
*  And so so anyways, you know, he could he could be old Mac. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3254.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't you know, my identity is not tied up in what I think this is. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3258.94s)]
*  Or also, old Mac could be African, like very, very clearly. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3262.6600000000003s)]
*  That one on the left easily could be an African man. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3266.46s)]
*  Which one? This guy? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3269.82s)]
*  This one, the one next to the white one to the left of that to you right there. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3270.62s)]
*  It easily could be an African man. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3274.7799999999997s)]
*  It certainly does look that way. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3276.2999999999997s)]
*  But I was I was on a plane to Mexico a couple of months ago and I was going into the old [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3278.7s)]
*  Mac room and I look I was like I wanted to take a picture of this guy and look to the [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3284.22s)]
*  left of me. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3287.2599999999998s)]
*  And he was an old Mac man sitting next to me and he was he was you know, he looked like [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3288.38s)]
*  he didn't look like any Mexican I've ever seen. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3293.06s)]
*  There's something there with the DNA of the old Mac people that is definitely connected [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3295.02s)]
*  with something else that that you don't see if you go to the Maya realm that you don't [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3299.7799999999997s)]
*  see if you go to like Mexico City. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3304.3799999999997s)]
*  They have something in their DNA. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3306.7s)]
*  They have this very specific look about them. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3307.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't know exactly what it is, but I'm like looking and I'm like this old Mac guy next [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3310.22s)]
*  to me. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3314.3399999999997s)]
*  So fascinating because it clearly could have been African explorers. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3314.8199999999997s)]
*  What made it? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3318.54s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'll tell you what. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3319.8999999999996s)]
*  Could we look up? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3322.2999999999997s)]
*  Gosh, look up the Traveler Old Mac monument, if you would please, Jamie. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3324.8999999999996s)]
*  It's the Traveler. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3330.22s)]
*  I want to call him. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3331.2599999999998s)]
*  I think he's monument 13. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3332.22s)]
*  There's another one called monument 19 that we should look at. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3334.18s)]
*  But he's this man that's very clearly not there we go. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3336.2999999999997s)]
*  Top left. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3340.54s)]
*  The one that's on Reddit. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3341.22s)]
*  In fact, this might be my post on Reddit. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3343.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3344.9399999999996s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3345.2999999999997s)]
*  So this guy right here. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3346.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3348.1s)]
*  So this is really, really fascinating. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3348.74s)]
*  So let's diagnose this. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3350.4199999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3352.22s)]
*  So flags, flags are invented is very unknown fact. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3352.5s)]
*  Flags are invented or the first place that we have evidence for is along the Nile Valley [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3358.18s)]
*  on these pre dynastic pots, which they're not the not the stone vases, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3362.74s)]
*  but just like clay pottery. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3368.2999999999997s)]
*  They would make little paintings on them. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3369.8599999999997s)]
*  And people have these river boats that have these flags on them. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3371.74s)]
*  And the flags would say what city you had come from or what village you had come from. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3373.8199999999997s)]
*  And so that so flags are an old world thing. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3378.54s)]
*  We don't have any evidence of flags in the New World. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3381.2999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3384.14s)]
*  He's also wearing a turban. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3384.42s)]
*  He's got this big turban that's draping off the back of his head. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3385.94s)]
*  And he very clearly has this distinct beard that's popping out. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3388.86s)]
*  Now, Native Americans, sometimes they can, you know, they are, they're Asiatic. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3392.82s)]
*  They have, they have Asian DNA and, and Asians don't really grow typically. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3397.7000000000003s)]
*  Sometimes they'll grow the little like stash and a little bit of a beard here, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3403.46s)]
*  but they don't have that big thick beard that you would see, you know, like in Europe [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3406.78s)]
*  or along the Mediterranean in the Middle East. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3410.9s)]
*  And so this guy has this big thick beard. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3413.6600000000003s)]
*  And then he's got boots on his feet as well. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3415.58s)]
*  And we think that these are these glyphs that you see to his left and right. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3417.8199999999997s)]
*  And these are really, really early Olmec glyphs. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3422.18s)]
*  And they interpret that foot to the left as saying that he came from somewhere. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3425.58s)]
*  He was a traveler. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3430.54s)]
*  And so the thought here is so this is, this is around 900 BC, give or take a little bit. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3431.9s)]
*  They don't really, they really have no idea when these, when these are made. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3439.1s)]
*  Like you go to all the monuments and it says made somewhere between 1500 BC and 400 BC. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3442.06s)]
*  And they'll say 1500 BC and 400 BC. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3448.06s)]
*  And so they, they really are uncertain about how old a lot of these monuments are. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3451.1s)]
*  Make it big again, Jamie, please. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3455.34s)]
*  But if we, if we shoot for dead center 900 BC, the, the Phoenicians out of the Mediterranean [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3456.5s)]
*  are launching these sailing expeditions around the coast of Africa. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3463.9s)]
*  These are the ancient world's greatest sailors that we know of. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3466.82s)]
*  And, and so there are, there were like experimental archaeological or scientific, I don't know, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3469.62s)]
*  expeditions done that show if you would send one of these early Iron Age boats, or if you [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3478.2200000000003s)]
*  send any ship out of the, out of the, the gates of Hercules or the Strait of Gibraltar, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3485.1s)]
*  and you send it out into the Atlantic, just, and it drifts just a little bit too far without [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3491.1400000000003s)]
*  turning south along the African coast. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3496.5s)]
*  It will be carried by a current across the Atlantic Ocean down into the Bahamas, the [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3498.86s)]
*  Caribbean and straight into the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3502.86s)]
*  And if that had happened, if people who had looked like they're in the old world like [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3505.02s)]
*  this guy, if that had happened, somebody from the old world, the largest civilization at [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3509.46s)]
*  the time, the empire in this area would have been the Olmecs. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3515.38s)]
*  And the reason I feel so strongly about that is because we do not have flags, turbines or [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3518.18s)]
*  boots in the, in the ancient Americas. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3522.98s)]
*  This guy looks nothing like a Native American. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3524.94s)]
*  And the flag, turban and boots are all old world features. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3528.1s)]
*  You know what's fascinating to me too? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3533.1400000000003s)]
*  The image on the lower right of the bird's head looks very similar to the carvings on [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3534.7000000000003s)]
*  Gobekli Tepe. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3539.98s)]
*  Doesn't it? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3541.42s)]
*  Yes, very. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3542.06s)]
*  The curve of the beak, that's not how birds beaks look. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3543.1800000000003s)]
*  Like that's, that's a very distinct style of artwork. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3547.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, and it's this- [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3550.7000000000003s)]
*  Did you find the images of the birds from Gobekli Tepe? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3551.34s)]
*  It's this, it's this raised relief art style. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3554.54s)]
*  So people talk about it a lot with, with Gobekli Tepe. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3557.34s)]
*  I mean, think about this. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3560.1400000000003s)]
*  This is, this is 11,600 years ago. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3560.78s)]
*  And you have, you have artisans and stonemasons who have been practicing for so long that [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3563.98s)]
*  now they're able to take a blank piece of stone and carve the face off to reveal the [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3570.6200000000003s)]
*  artwork from underneath it. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3576.34s)]
*  Not carve the artwork into the stone, but carve the stone away and reveal this sculpture [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3577.54s)]
*  from underneath. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3582.38s)]
*  How similar does that look? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3583.58s)]
*  It's bizarre, right? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3584.78s)]
*  Real similar. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3585.7000000000003s)]
*  And so it's the, it's the exact same kind of art style that you see in the Olmec realm. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3586.9s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3593.06s)]
*  The 3D stone carvings. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3593.58s)]
*  Instead of carving it directly into the stone, carve the stone around it. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3596.1s)]
*  They're both doing the same thing. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3599.54s)]
*  It takes a lot of time. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3600.78s)]
*  I mean, how- [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3602.58s)]
*  A lot more effort. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3603.34s)]
*  Could you imagine? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3604.06s)]
*  Weird, weird stuff. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3605.02s)]
*  It's also like the idea that this is documenting time. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3607.3s)]
*  You know, the handbags or whatever those things are, what it actually is, is the sun going [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3612.06s)]
*  over the earth. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3618.98s)]
*  You know, I have, I'm writing a paper about this, but this might be a good place to talk [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3620.58s)]
*  about it. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3626.1s)]
*  So you know, the handbag mystery is very fascinating. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3627.14s)]
*  We have them in Assyria. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3630.7s)]
*  We have them in Mesopotamia. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3632.7s)]
*  As far as I know, I don't think one's been found in Egypt. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3637.34s)]
*  You can see them on the top of those T pillars and go Bekli Tepe. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3639.54s)]
*  And there's one in the Olmec realm. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3643.1800000000003s)]
*  Are you familiar with this? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3644.46s)]
*  No. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3645.42s)]
*  Monument 19, if we can look that up. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3645.98s)]
*  I mean, dude, I think it's the coolest handbag. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3648.82s)]
*  And when I saw it in person, I like jumped. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3651.82s)]
*  I had been waiting years to see it. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3654.14s)]
*  That's crazy. It's the same thing? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3655.58s)]
*  Olmec Monument 19. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3656.9s)]
*  So this guy, he's wrapped in, he's sitting in Quetzalcoatl. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3658.34s)]
*  He's sitting in Quetzalcoatl. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3663.58s)]
*  Could you do the one at the top level where we get the full picture? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3665.78s)]
*  There we go. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3667.78s)]
*  So this stone is probably about this big. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3668.46s)]
*  It's probably about this big. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3670.5s)]
*  And it sits on a table like this. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3671.2999999999997s)]
*  So he's sitting inside the feathered serpent, Quetzalcoatl. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3673.46s)]
*  And so he's sitting inside the feathered serpent and he's holding this handbag. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3677.66s)]
*  And I'm not sure. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3680.7799999999997s)]
*  So he has this. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3681.74s)]
*  And if you can, if you see, he has a feathered serpent mask around his head as well. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3683.14s)]
*  I'm not sure what exactly is above him there. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3687.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, they're actually two. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3689.58s)]
*  It's really hard to make it out. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3691.9s)]
*  But what's above him, that little box looking thing is some kind of box that's [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3693.58s)]
*  being held up by two birds on each end. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3697.86s)]
*  But the important thing here is the fact that this is the first depiction of the [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3699.94s)]
*  feathered serpent in all of Mesoamerica that we know of. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3703.54s)]
*  And it's, it might be the oldest handbag known as far as like what we have official [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3707.2200000000003s)]
*  dates for. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3712.86s)]
*  And so the idea here is that he's some kind of sacred shaman, bringer of [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3713.82s)]
*  enlightenment, bringer of knowledge, something like that. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3719.1s)]
*  And so I had been on the hunt for another handbag. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3723.26s)]
*  Everywhere I go, I'm always looking for a handbag. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3726.82s)]
*  I was in Cambodia a couple of weeks ago. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3728.46s)]
*  I'm going around the temples of Angkor Wat and there's hieroglyphs and carvings [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3730.1000000000004s)]
*  all over the walls. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3735.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm looking for a handbag. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3735.82s)]
*  I can't find one. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3736.6200000000003s)]
*  But when I was in, when I was in central Mexico, I was at a site called Kakashla [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3737.78s)]
*  and I found another handbag person. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3743.54s)]
*  I've never like officially published it. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3747.34s)]
*  It's on my ex. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3749.54s)]
*  If you'd want to look it up. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3750.26s)]
*  What is the timeline for that one? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3751.3s)]
*  They don't really know. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3753.1000000000004s)]
*  When you look at the monument, it says, it says anywhere from 1400 BC to 400 BC. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3754.1s)]
*  That's just what they think. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3759.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, the Olmec, the Olmec realm is so uncertain and, and we don't have hard [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3760.6600000000003s)]
*  dates for almost, for almost anything. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3767.26s)]
*  They appear on the historical line on this historical timeline is a fully [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3768.86s)]
*  fledged civilization capable of creating what you're seeing from the very [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3772.1800000000003s)]
*  beginning, just like so many civilizations. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3776.42s)]
*  It's like, as soon as they arrive on, you know, as soon as they arrive in the [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3778.86s)]
*  world, they're doing everything to the fullest capacity. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3782.46s)]
*  And we don't have any evidence in the Olmec realm of them working their way [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3785.54s)]
*  towards being able to do things like this. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3790.98s)]
*  It's just from the very beginning, they're able to make monuments like this, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3792.7400000000002s)]
*  move these 50 ton Olmec heads. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3795.7400000000002s)]
*  The largest head is this, you'll find this interesting. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3798.5s)]
*  So there was a nautical engineer that MEC, which is an organization I'm with, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3802.3s)]
*  it's the Maya Exploration Center. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3807.9s)]
*  It's, it's run by Dr. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3809.2200000000003s)]
*  A. Barnhart. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3810.58s)]
*  I'm a member of it. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3811.14s)]
*  And, and one of the guys that worked with us traveled into the Olmec realm. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3813.18s)]
*  He, he's a nautical engineer. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3818.22s)]
*  He's fascinated with, he's fascinated with how were the Olmecs moving these [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3819.42s)]
*  huge heads up and down these rivers? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3825.22s)]
*  So they live in like the rivers swamps. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3827.14s)]
*  They have to cross some mountain ranges. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3828.86s)]
*  How are you getting these heads 90 miles away from the Sierra de la [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3830.14s)]
*  Tuchla volcanic belt? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3834.54s)]
*  That's where they're pulling the basalt from. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3835.94s)]
*  Cause we found unfinished heads, like at the base of these big basalt [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3837.42s)]
*  quarries and they're transporting them 90 kilometers away through, you know, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3840.14s)]
*  like I was saying, rivers and valleys. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3844.7799999999997s)]
*  90 miles or kilometers? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3846.62s)]
*  I think it's kilometers. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3847.94s)]
*  It's kilometers as the crow flies. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3849.02s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3850.7799999999997s)]
*  And so much further when you're actually dealing with the complications of the [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3851.98s)]
*  terrain and, and so he was fascinated like, okay, how do they get them to the [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3856.62s)]
*  river and then how do they get them on the boat? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3863.1s)]
*  And when it's on the boat, how does, how exactly does this work if they're [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3865.54s)]
*  transporting it by boat? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3868.2599999999998s)]
*  And kind of the same mystery in Egypt too, right? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3869.7400000000002s)]
*  Like how, how do the nuances of these things work? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3872.42s)]
*  So he devised this algorithm or whatever, where you could put in the hypothetical [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3875.1s)]
*  size of your Olmec raft and put in the hypothetical size of an Olmec head into [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3881.3s)]
*  this database or whatever. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3885.5s)]
*  And when you made a raft that was too big to go down the narrow stretches of [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3887.58s)]
*  the Coatz Calcos river, which is like the Olmecs Nile river, when the raft was too [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3893.1s)]
*  big and too wide to actually go down the river and you put a five ton Olmec head [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3897.66s)]
*  on it, it would sink that raft. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3901.74s)]
*  But the smallest Olmec head is six tons and the largest one is 52 tons. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3903.9s)]
*  So how are they, how are they doing it? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3908.94s)]
*  And this is something that like all archeologists have quietly known this idea [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3911.14s)]
*  of they're just being transported on these simple balsa rafts must be wrong. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3915.1s)]
*  It's, you know, it's, it's unexplained. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3919.2999999999997s)]
*  How are these things being done? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3920.94s)]
*  And I just find this realm really fascinating. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3922.8199999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3925.66s)]
*  It is. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3926.86s)]
*  And then when, do they even know what language they spoke? [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3927.1800000000003s)]
*  No, we don't know what language they spoke. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3931.0200000000004s)]
*  We don't even know what they call themselves. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3933.5s)]
*  The only reason we call them the Olmecs is because Cortes 1519 to 1521, he's [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3935.1000000000004s)]
*  moving through Mexico to conquer Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3941.0200000000004s)]
*  During this time, you have these Spanish chroniclers that are taking in information, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3944.6200000000003s)]
*  you know, taking in information, but not at the rate that everything's being [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3949.38s)]
*  destroyed, you know, all these people are dying from this disease and influenza. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3952.0200000000004s)]
*  And there's a record of what the people who lived in the Olmec region are called [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3956.42s)]
*  at that time in 15, 1520, let's say, and the Aztecs called them the Olmecs in [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3963.5s)]
*  their language, Nahuatl, and those Olmec people, the name means the rubber people [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3970.78s)]
*  or the people of the land of rubber. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3975.86s)]
*  They produced rubber and that's how the Olmecs were so rich so early on in time. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3977.0600000000004s)]
*  But these are not the people living in 1519 are not the Olmecs. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3981.1000000000004s)]
*  There is already the Olmecs have fallen and there are other cultures that have [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3984.54s)]
*  arisen and fallen in this same region as well. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3988.34s)]
*  The Olmecs are far, far, far, far into the distant past. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3990.9s)]
*  The Aztecs maybe didn't even know who the Olmecs were. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3995.86s)]
*  You know, you know, so are you familiar with Teotihuacan? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=3999.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4001.98s)]
*  The, you know, the, the, the three massive, we have the temple of the sun, the [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4002.02s)]
*  temple of the moon, and then the temple of Quetzalcoatl and they form this kind of [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4006.5s)]
*  like Orion's belt alignment, similar to Giza. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4010.9s)]
*  Well, you know, when the Aztecs arrived in Mexico, Teotihuacan had been abandoned [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4015.02s)]
*  for almost a thousand years, we think. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4020.6600000000003s)]
*  So when they arrived, Teotihuacan is already gone. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4023.42s)]
*  We don't even know the name of Teotihuacan. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4025.9s)]
*  We don't know the name of the people. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4028.34s)]
*  We don't know the name of the city. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4029.54s)]
*  You know, we know their relationship with other people around them, like the [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4032.38s)]
*  Maya were at war with Teotihuacan, but the civilization had already fallen. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4034.9s)]
*  So when the Aztecs arrived, the Olmecs had been gone for almost 2000 years, at least. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4038.46s)]
*  The Olmecs had already been gone. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4046.38s)]
*  Teotihuacan had been gone for a thousand years. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4047.42s)]
*  The Maya had already collapsed. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4049.86s)]
*  The Maya collapsed long before the Spanish got there. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4051.9s)]
*  And so, you know, it's just, again, like, like the Americas are just so mysterious [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4056.06s)]
*  and there's so much to know there. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4060.54s)]
*  And so kind of getting back to what I was saying is when I, when I talk about the [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4061.94s)]
*  mysteries of the Americas, I immediately get accosted by other of my quote unquote [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4066.58s)]
*  colleagues. I don't have any colleagues in the academic realm, but, you know, other [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4071.94s)]
*  academics who will like immediately jump in my comment section on X or whatever, and [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4076.02s)]
*  they'll reprimand me and they'll be like, oh, so back to the pseudo archaeology, is [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4080.94s)]
*  it? And I'm like, so, so I can't talk about anything that's fascinating. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4084.42s)]
*  I need to talk about things that are boring so you don't get upset with me. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4088.22s)]
*  And now it's just like the popular audience has completely had enough of it. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4091.5s)]
*  And I'll have like 15 people jump in and defend me and be like, yeah, and they'll be [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4097.06s)]
*  like, and they'll be like, like, you'll be like, you know, OK, this is a perfect [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4103.22s)]
*  representation of what you guys do. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4106.900000000001s)]
*  I step just slightly out of this line or what you think is appropriate for me. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4108.860000000001s)]
*  And I'm talking about things that are interesting that inspire people to be [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4112.780000000001s)]
*  interested in the ancient world, to go see these sites like these people. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4116.06s)]
*  They don't like you. They don't like the people that you have on. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4120.179999999999s)]
*  But how many people do you think you've sent to Egypt? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4123.219999999999s)]
*  You know, like you had a significant impact. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4125.62s)]
*  The show had a significant impact on me being interested in the ancient world. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4128.339999999999s)]
*  And I have traveled all over the world, you know, because largely, you know, some of [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4132.54s)]
*  this show inspired me to do that. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4138.179999999999s)]
*  And and I'm probably one of the few people that found you because of Graham Hancock. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4139.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Rather than the other way around. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4145.62s)]
*  And and so, you know, I've traveled all over the world. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4147.38s)]
*  And then what I have done is inspired other people to travel around the world. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4150.38s)]
*  So, you know, how many of these archaeologists that are keyboard warriors [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4153.900000000001s)]
*  hiding behind, you know, a desk or whatever, how many of these people are [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4157.22s)]
*  inspiring people to travel around the world? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4161.5s)]
*  And, you know, it's just it's just again, we're about to reach this like [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4163.740000000001s)]
*  archaeological wild west where I don't really know what's going to happen in the [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4167.02s)]
*  future. You're always going to have people that are threatened by an emerging new [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4170.54s)]
*  thing and they're going to attack it like, you know, famously in this world, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4175.94s)]
*  Howard Stern used to attack podcasts as being useless. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4182.9s)]
*  Oh, really? Why are you wasting your time? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4186.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Get a radio show. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4187.9s)]
*  Figure out how to do it. This is the beginning. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4189.379999999999s)]
*  The early days, you know, obviously you can't do that anymore. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4191.099999999999s)]
*  But I think the same thing is happening with our with archaeologists because. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4194.86s)]
*  Flint Dibbles own university that has an archaeology program, they're cutting the [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4201.62s)]
*  archaeology. I saw that. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4205.58s)]
*  Yeah. Which is this is why you're in this like survival mode, this famine mode. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4206.9s)]
*  And fam it's terrible. But famine thinking is always very dangerous. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4212.82s)]
*  You you see it with people that don't want other people to be successful. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4218.34s)]
*  It exists in the comedy world. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4222.82s)]
*  There's famine thinking when other people start doing better, they start attacking [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4224.54s)]
*  those people. They never attack people that aren't doing as well. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4227.34s)]
*  It's just a natural human instinct, unfortunately. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4230.14s)]
*  And it's a natural human instinct from people with poor character. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4232.46s)]
*  And I think that these academic institutes, they reinforce poor character and they [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4235.339999999999s)]
*  actually encourage it. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4239.78s)]
*  Poor character and the this like. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4241.259999999999s)]
*  Labeling people in the worst possible light in order to make your point, which is [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4246.179999999999s)]
*  like ad hominem attacks are always a sign that your argument sucks. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4250.78s)]
*  Everybody knows that if you really understand debating and you really understand [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4253.9s)]
*  like the actual impact that these kind of conversations have on people, the [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4257.179999999999s)]
*  objective person on the outside looking at it, they see someone attacking someone [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4261.82s)]
*  calling them all these names unfounded. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4265.259999999999s)]
*  They go, oh, that guy's argument probably sucks like instantaneously. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4267.179999999999s)]
*  So they're destroying themselves while they're doing this. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4270.54s)]
*  But this is you'll see this in every walk of life. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4273.94s)]
*  You'll see this in everything. It's just a human thing when they don't want to [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4277.299999999999s)]
*  work as hard as other people or they don't have the young fire like you have. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4281.46s)]
*  Like there's a thing that people have when they're very curious and young and they [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4285.219999999999s)]
*  don't have maybe a lot of responsibilities or bills or problems. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4288.58s)]
*  And they can just they can devote their energy to this pursuit that terrifies [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4292.98s)]
*  people that have been kind of like half assing it for a long time, half assing [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4297.0199999999995s)]
*  it and hiding behind these these, you know, certificates on their wall that [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4302.099999999999s)]
*  show that they're the these are the gatekeepers of information. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4308.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's like it's not going to work anymore. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4311.62s)]
*  Doesn't work anymore with podcasts. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4315.099999999999s)]
*  It's not going to work anymore with your kind of work and archaeology. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4317.0599999999995s)]
*  It's not going to work anymore with UFO disclosure. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4321.02s)]
*  It's not going to work anymore with any of this stuff. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4324.900000000001s)]
*  Like people are way more interested in getting to the bottom of things and they [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4326.46s)]
*  don't trust institutions anymore. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4331.42s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And and the institutions are feeling the pressure of independent [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4333.580000000001s)]
*  media, you know, like going back to the go back to the Tepi Tree situation. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4339.740000000001s)]
*  It'll be really interesting to see, you know, like like Jimmy's in an interesting [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4345.02s)]
*  position where where maybe there's maybe there's a way that like the relationship [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4348.82s)]
*  between independent people and the popular, enthusiastic audience and, you [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4354.34s)]
*  know, the archaeological departments in Turkey can have a better relationship [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4360.38s)]
*  because of these things in the future. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4364.0199999999995s)]
*  You know how that would work? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4365.38s)]
*  People like you become the head of an archaeology department. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4366.62s)]
*  That's this is really the only way it's going to work. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4370.139999999999s)]
*  It's like it's almost like these these institutions have to feel so much [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4372.9s)]
*  pressure and so much disgust from the general public that they start [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4376.02s)]
*  incorporating new people into it. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4382.02s)]
*  You know, sort of like CNN is trying to hire objective journalists now. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4383.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. We got to get rid of Don Lemon and Brian Stelter. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4387.18s)]
*  Oh, actually, he's back. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4390.26s)]
*  But they so they they try to course correct because that's the only way to survive. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4391.540000000001s)]
*  Because it's not working. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4395.740000000001s)]
*  What you're doing is not working from from what I can see in the limited amount [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4397.1s)]
*  that I see. And this this is the hard part is is sort of we get a skewed view [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4402.1s)]
*  into the archaeological world or the academic world. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4406.620000000001s)]
*  And sometimes I don't even know what's what because because the archaeologists [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4410.02s)]
*  that make their opinions known are usually the ones with really bad opinions, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4415.02s)]
*  you know, and and then all the other people that are pretty agreeable. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4418.740000000001s)]
*  They just kind of sit on the sideline. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4422.660000000001s)]
*  Right. And it's hard to know. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4424.3s)]
*  Like, what are most people? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4427.1s)]
*  What are most these these future archaeologists? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4428.5s)]
*  Where they think where they're where's their mind at? [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4430.78s)]
*  And some of the young people I talk to, they are fascinated by Graham Hancock. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4433.0599999999995s)]
*  They may not agree with, you know, like they I guess in a way I could say [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4436.7s)]
*  they may love the first nine episodes of ancient apocalypse. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4440.78s)]
*  But in the tenth episode where Graham gives his the end of his thesis, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4444.0599999999995s)]
*  they'll be like, OK, I see the evidence differently. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4447.0599999999995s)]
*  But this is really fascinating. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4449.62s)]
*  And some of the mysteries you pointed out along the way are valid, like, you know, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4451.219999999999s)]
*  the idea of of, you know, the the artifact record of the tools that we have [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4454.62s)]
*  that the Egyptians in the Old Kingdom were using [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4460.3s)]
*  does not fit the megalithic architecture that they then produced. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4463.42s)]
*  OK, what's the answer to this mystery? [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4466.34s)]
*  Could it have been that we're missing a chapter [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4468.580000000001s)]
*  of history that's before that, where a different civilization did it? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4471.820000000001s)]
*  Or is there for some reason there's an artifact record that's lost to us today? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4475.22s)]
*  And so you have, you know, guys like Graham who will come in and posit, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4480.820000000001s)]
*  well, there could have been a lost civilization that that did this. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4484.5s)]
*  And then an archaeologist, the young archaeologist may disagree [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4487.34s)]
*  with the lost civilization, but they say, but Graham, you really pointed out [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4490.26s)]
*  the fact and made it well known that, you know, the artifact record that we have [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4492.9400000000005s)]
*  and how they built the pyramids, that's a big mystery. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4496.26s)]
*  And how they built the pyramids, that's a big mystery. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4498.18s)]
*  This is worth considering. And they like Graham. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4500.14s)]
*  You know, so a lot of young archaeologists, at least I say a lot. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4502.38s)]
*  It's really just the ones I talk to in my spare time that are my age. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4506.46s)]
*  They're fascinated by these ideas. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4510.3s)]
*  And my hope is maybe these people become leaders someday. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4512.1s)]
*  But at the same time, like, I don't know, to get ahead in that world, man, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4516.18s)]
*  you got to be a dog. The world's poisoned. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4520.5s)]
*  And the people at the top are not going to let go. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4522.46s)]
*  They're going to stay in there till the, you know, no chomsky stage. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4524.58s)]
*  You know, this is I just think it's never going to end in that way. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4527.62s)]
*  I think it's got to become some sort of an independent branch, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4531.5s)]
*  like, you know, a break off. Yeah. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4535.46s)]
*  You know, Zahi is a Zahi is a really good example [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4537.42s)]
*  of what I think goes on in archaeology in Egypt. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4541.58s)]
*  You know, you have a lot of different missions from different countries [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4545.299999999999s)]
*  working in Egypt. You have like a German mission. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4548.299999999999s)]
*  You have the American mission, you know, different people working at different sites. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4550.299999999999s)]
*  And I can't speak to every country that's working there. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4553.62s)]
*  You have Australian missions that are working in Egypt, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4556.5s)]
*  taking at certain sites. But but [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4558.58s)]
*  you know, when I when I watch Zahi, I'm like, I'm like, yeah, this is [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4562.219999999999s)]
*  the what you're seeing. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4566.86s)]
*  This is the attitude that has been at the spearpoint of Egyptology [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4567.74s)]
*  for the last lifetime. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4573.34s)]
*  And and you can just imagine what goes on. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4576.06s)]
*  Like, I mean, think about being on a dig site with him. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4578.9800000000005s)]
*  Think about working in his industry underneath him. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4580.9400000000005s)]
*  Think about all the people that were a part of the discoveries [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4583.58s)]
*  that he made that feel so disrespected and so overlooked. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4586.42s)]
*  You know, not once during that podcast did he ever acknowledge [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4589.860000000001s)]
*  all the hardworking archaeologists that were actually there in the dirt [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4592.780000000001s)]
*  doing all this hard work. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4596.14s)]
*  He just took all this limelight. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4597.660000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, clearly his identity is tied into [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4599.62s)]
*  what's in his coffee table book. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4604.46s)]
*  And, you know, for him to act like that's the Bible of Giza is insane. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4606.3s)]
*  I own the book and I and I've read it. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4609.3s)]
*  And it has half of a page about the subterranean chamber in Kufu's pyramid. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4611.66s)]
*  So it's it's you can write a whole book about that. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4616.54s)]
*  What is your I don't mean to interrupt. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4620.14s)]
*  Keep going. Oh, I was just going to say I was just going to say, man, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4622.38s)]
*  when you go to Egypt, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4626.7s)]
*  there are some things that you're going to be appalled by, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4627.98s)]
*  by like the modern Egyptian world. I [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4630.339999999999s)]
*  I do this series on YouTube called Megalith. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4636.74s)]
*  You've never seen before. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4639.66s)]
*  And I'm always trying to like find these weird obscure blocks [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4640.54s)]
*  that you never see on Google. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4642.7s)]
*  And I'm walking around the side of the pyramid of the [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4644.339999999999s)]
*  and there's a turd on the side of the pyramid. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4649.74s)]
*  A human turd. Yeah. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4652.139999999999s)]
*  And it's from the guard that's like sitting up on top of the hill, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4653.339999999999s)]
*  the Egyptian guard looking down at me. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4655.98s)]
*  And I go around to to land of Kim, who I'm traveling with. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4658.0599999999995s)]
*  Have you heard of him before? No. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4662.219999999999s)]
*  He's an American that lives in Egypt and he's got his theories on the pyramids. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4663.74s)]
*  And I'm traveling with him. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4667.459999999999s)]
*  And I was like, I was like, there's a turd on the pyramid over there. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4668.339999999999s)]
*  And he's like, he's like, yeah, yeah. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4671.54s)]
*  And I was like a tourist. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4673.62s)]
*  And he goes, no, not not tourists. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4674.66s)]
*  And so, you know, that that the poop on the pyramid is pretty much like [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4676.82s)]
*  that's kind of my that's kind of my mental that's burned into my brain, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4681.66s)]
*  my image of of Egyptology in some aspects, like when it's isolated to Egypt. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4684.38s)]
*  I can't speak for all the other missions that operate in Egypt. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4689.58s)]
*  But what were you about to say? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4691.7s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4693.38s)]
*  Well, where were we at when I was going to interrupt? [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4694.54s)]
*  Oh, this is what I remember. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4697.82s)]
*  What is your opinion about Christopher Dunn's ideas? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4700.1s)]
*  I don't know. I really don't know, man. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4704.38s)]
*  I took for people that don't know. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4706.62s)]
*  Christopher Dunn has a theory that the Great Pyramid was actually [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4708.86s)]
*  some sort of a power generator [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4713.1s)]
*  that it produced hydrogen gas. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4717.700000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, you know, I know that that the Egyptians, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4719.54s)]
*  it's obvious that they have technology that that is lost to us today. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4723.5s)]
*  The drill holes. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4727.900000000001s)]
*  The way they cut the concrete, excuse me, the granite. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4729.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4733.26s)]
*  But, you know, I really don't know. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4735.3s)]
*  As far as the, you know, like the the manufacturing aspects, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4737.02s)]
*  the engine, I guess, the engineering, the potential usages of these artifacts. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4741.18s)]
*  It's not really like my specialty. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4746.66s)]
*  Like, you know, like these these vases are are. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4748.38s)]
*  Oh, this is a heavy one. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4752.02s)]
*  These vases are fascinating. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4753.34s)]
*  But, you know, I guess my interest would be studying like, what can I [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4754.62s)]
*  what can we learn about the context around these things [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4758.02s)]
*  and how they existed in their world and how people interacted with them more so than, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4761.54s)]
*  you know, what did these things, what were they actually used for, I guess, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4767.1s)]
*  and how exactly were they made? [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4769.82s)]
*  And so I just don't know about Chris Dunn's theory. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4771.5s)]
*  You know, I guess the first thing that comes to my mind is like, well, you know, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4774.5s)]
*  most of the pyramid is limestone and the interior is granite. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4777.46s)]
*  I I hear people talk about how like the makeup of the granite [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4780.219999999999s)]
*  could be conductive in some way. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4784.099999999999s)]
*  But, man, it's just it's like the farthest thing from my set of knowledge. Right. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4785.78s)]
*  It is absolutely fascinating, though, because if he's accurate, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4789.86s)]
*  if he if he's on to it, like, boy, does that change everything. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4793.42s)]
*  And if those Italian scientists that believe that there's [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4797.5s)]
*  literally a two kilometer deep structure underneath the pyramid, if they're correct, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4801.38s)]
*  boy, yeah, the whole thing is like, what are we even talking about now? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4806.82s)]
*  Yeah, I find that fascinating. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4810.78s)]
*  I think that the the main drama around those scans was, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4813.0599999999995s)]
*  you know, when the scans came out, I don't think anybody was denying [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4816.98s)]
*  what was seen on the scans. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4819.46s)]
*  I think it was like they they had the [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4820.66s)]
*  they had the artistic interpretations of the art concepts that they produced [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4825.02s)]
*  of what they thought was in there. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4828.22s)]
*  And I think a lot of people were like, whoa. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4829.62s)]
*  Yeah, that was a little weird because because even me, [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4831.66s)]
*  I was a little bit like, huh, when when they they made a [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4834.3s)]
*  they made an art concept of it. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4838.780000000001s)]
*  And they took the king's chamber in the relieving chambers [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4840.38s)]
*  in the Great Pyramid and superimposed it onto the middle pyramid. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4843.66s)]
*  And they they, I guess, quintupled it like they made five of them. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4847.18s)]
*  And I was thinking like, why, why, why do that? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4851.1s)]
*  Like, you're kind of you're kind of undermining what your scan is [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4854.34s)]
*  when you're creating like a fantasy image, because [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4857.26s)]
*  you're getting ahead of your skin. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4860.54s)]
*  Yeah, you're getting ahead of yourself because, you know, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4861.46s)]
*  we need to do the whole scan again, but you need to have tests. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4863.820000000001s)]
*  So like Luis Alvarez, are you familiar with him? [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4867.3s)]
*  He worked on the on the Manhattan Project with Oppenheimer. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4870.06s)]
*  And after the war in the 50s or in the 60s, [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4873.02s)]
*  he got to go to Egypt and he scanned in the coffer pyramid. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4875.9400000000005s)]
*  He did the move on scans. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4878.54s)]
*  And when he was in there, they tested they tested it all before. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4880.06s)]
*  So he was able to scan up through the pyramid. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4883.860000000001s)]
*  And he got the pinnacle of the pyramid and he got all four corners. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4885.660000000001s)]
*  And so they tested it and they did it several times just to confirm [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4888.580000000001s)]
*  that what they were getting was right. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4891.780000000001s)]
*  And I think the move on scan only scan like 19 percent of the pyramid. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4894.02s)]
*  This is the 60s. So but they didn't find anything. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4897.740000000001s)]
*  But the Stanford Project came the next decade and they found subterranean [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4901.46s)]
*  chambers under coffers pyramid. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4906.1s)]
*  There's one like 69 feet down and another one 120 feet down. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4907.62s)]
*  Huge chambers bigger than the chambers inside the pyramids. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4912.3s)]
*  And so, yeah, I mean, I guess we just have to wait and see [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4915.42s)]
*  what's going to happen. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4919.58s)]
*  And I know that the scan pyramids guys, the ones who found the [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4920.38s)]
*  the void above the Grand Gallery in the Great Pyramid, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4924.18s)]
*  I know they're interested in this now and they're going to verify [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4927.54s)]
*  if this is true or not. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4932.14s)]
*  And yeah, I'm interested in seeing how this goes. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4933.54s)]
*  This could be a big year, man. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4936.62s)]
*  If if they actually drill into that void above the Grand Gallery, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4937.78s)]
*  that's going to be a big deal. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4943.18s)]
*  What do you think's in that void? [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4944.7s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4948.14s)]
*  You know, that's pretty big, right? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4949.3s)]
*  It's the size of two semi trucks. It's [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4950.82s)]
*  it's the same size or bigger than the Grand Gallery itself. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4954.3s)]
*  And the Grand Gallery, when you go in, it's a it's a huge building. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4957.0599999999995s)]
*  Or, you know, you're inside a building inside of the pyramid and [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4960.9s)]
*  it's as big or bigger than that. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4965.0199999999995s)]
*  And, you know, the most conservative explanation is that [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4966.46s)]
*  it's an open interior that served as a ramp [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4970.38s)]
*  where they were pulling the blocks up higher up to the top. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4973.26s)]
*  Nobody really knows exactly how they were built in the in the [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4975.94s)]
*  the angle of that Grand Gallery is really, really steep. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4979.06s)]
*  I don't know that you could pull an 80 ton granite block up [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4983.3s)]
*  an angle that steep. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4987.02s)]
*  It seems like everyone who's an expert in in that, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4988.02s)]
*  you know, who studies independently is like, no, you're never going to pull [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4991.78s)]
*  you're never going to pull weight up. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4994.94s)]
*  To be honest, I have no idea. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4997.06s)]
*  You know, I'm. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=4999.18s)]
*  I was fascinated when I heard an Egyptologist when I was in Egypt [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5001.06s)]
*  in January, and I was asking him, what do you think that they're going to find [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5004.58s)]
*  in that void? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5007.14s)]
*  And he was like, he was telling me, I think that that's where Kufu is buried. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5008.1s)]
*  And I was like, oh, OK, really? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5011.1s)]
*  So you actually think that he's still in the pyramid. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5012.66s)]
*  He was like, yeah, I think I think all the rest of it was a decoy. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5014.86s)]
*  And I think that his son, who's able to continue his legacy, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5018.1s)]
*  like permanently sealed him in that in that tomb. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5020.58s)]
*  And I was like, that's that's fascinating. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5023.46s)]
*  And and I said, I said, you know, there's other voids that they found, too. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5025.62s)]
*  What do you think of those? [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5029.1s)]
*  And so we're standing on this falooka at one a.m. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5030.3s)]
*  on the Nile and we're just, you know, shooting the shit. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5032.5s)]
*  And he was like, he's like, I have something to show you. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5034.9400000000005s)]
*  And he pulls out his phone. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5036.86s)]
*  He was like, I cannot send to you, but I will show you for one second. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5038.1s)]
*  He showed me a photo of the inside of a chamber that I've never [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5042.62s)]
*  I hadn't seen before. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5045.58s)]
*  And it hasn't been published yet. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5046.86s)]
*  I'll let you know when it comes out. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5049.74s)]
*  But it's burned into my mind. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5051.86s)]
*  It's from the floor shooting across the room. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5053.18s)]
*  All you can see is two walls meeting each other in a roof. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5055.820000000001s)]
*  And I said, I said, that's in a that's in that's in the Great Pyramid. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5058.22s)]
*  He goes and he was like. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5061.42s)]
*  And he wouldn't share it. He wouldn't share it with me. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5063.66s)]
*  I didn't want to press him too much, but they stole his phone. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5065.3s)]
*  Give me that phone, motherfucker. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5069.62s)]
*  Shut up. You can't keep this fuck. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5070.780000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, man, that's happening all over the world. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5074.62s)]
*  Like this delay of of information is all over the world. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5076.9800000000005s)]
*  Do you remember the the tunnels that came out or the the [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5081.34s)]
*  maybe is in November, the headlines that no. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5085.34s)]
*  Yeah, I was in November. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5088.740000000001s)]
*  The headlines that came out about the tunnels that were found under Cusco [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5089.58s)]
*  in Peru that connect to Sacsayhuaman and they go underneath the Coracancha. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5092.860000000001s)]
*  They knew about that a long time ago. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5096.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's documented. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5097.700000000001s)]
*  In the fall of last year, I made friends with the head archaeologist at that site. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5100.46s)]
*  And one early morning at like 4 a.m. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5106.38s)]
*  He took me down inside part of the tunnels. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5109.38s)]
*  And yeah, I was I was in there before it all came out. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5111.38s)]
*  And he took me into so all these archaeologists, they like live on site. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5114.86s)]
*  And these are all these are all Inca people. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5119.78s)]
*  So they believe that they're studying their ancestral heritage. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5122.1s)]
*  These are really good people. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5124.86s)]
*  And I'm in their, you know, shoddy little home that's on the archaeological site. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5126.3s)]
*  I mean, they probably make no money. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5130.9400000000005s)]
*  But they're just they're just so passionate about this. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5132.78s)]
*  And they feel like they're doing something. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5134.7s)]
*  That's like one of the most important things anybody in the world is doing. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5135.74s)]
*  And have you been to Peru? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5138.98s)]
*  No. When you go to Cusco, man, the Sacred Valley, it's it has something there [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5140.94s)]
*  that not even Egypt has. I don't know how to explain it. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5145.54s)]
*  Really? It's a it's it's a sacred place. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5147.62s)]
*  It's like the Sacred Valley is exactly right. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5151.34s)]
*  It's a magical kind of place. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5153.86s)]
*  Machu Picchu. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5155.94s)]
*  You should book two days when you go because you're going to get rained on on one of the days. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5157.62s)]
*  But you're out there on this, you know, seven thousand eight hundred foot mountain top. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5161.26s)]
*  And it's so steep. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5166.099999999999s)]
*  You cannot see the bottom when you're looking over the side of the city. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5167.14s)]
*  And you're just in the sacred place in the middle of the Amazon, up in the mountains. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5169.54s)]
*  And it's just a different place, man. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5173.780000000001s)]
*  It has a type of charm that like not even Egypt has. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5176.820000000001s)]
*  Egypt, you're going to be blown away by the structures. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5179.42s)]
*  You're going to be blown away by the by the pyramids and the temples. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5181.46s)]
*  But this is something else. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5184.34s)]
*  It has a it has an otherworldly like you feel like you're on some kind of [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5185.58s)]
*  like Star Wars planet when you're there. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5189.58s)]
*  It's fascinating because of the environment. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5191.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's like the environment. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5194.14s)]
*  You know, I wondered if it was when you're in Cusco, you're at eleven thousand five [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5196.58s)]
*  hundred foot elevation. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5201.22s)]
*  And I wondered if I was like missing oxygen to my brain. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5202.14s)]
*  And I was like, well, this place is awesome. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5204.78s)]
*  Yeah. But no, it really is amazing. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5207.54s)]
*  And the people are so nice. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5209.58s)]
*  And so anyway, you was a trip. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5211.62s)]
*  I said, yeah. What was that? [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5214.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's I think it was very similar to Alexandria's library. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5216.74s)]
*  I think it was a place of study where people are studying the studying the stars. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5221.98s)]
*  Archaeo astronomy is like is like the next frontier of archaeology. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5226.18s)]
*  It's the way that people it's the way that ancient people are interacting [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5230.3s)]
*  with the night sky and what they know about the cosmos. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5232.98s)]
*  You know, the Maya were calculating like millions of years into the future [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5234.82s)]
*  and millions of years into the past. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5238.22s)]
*  And they had this numerology system that's just amazing. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5240.46s)]
*  But anyway, so I'm at so I'm at Soxie, Oman, and they take me into this back room [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5244.74s)]
*  and they show me all these bodies that they pull. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5249.42s)]
*  I probably shouldn't be saying this, but we're [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5252.78s)]
*  they show me all these bodies that they pulled out of the tunnels. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5254.38s)]
*  And it was these it was these they thought that they were like sacred guardians [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5257.06s)]
*  of whatever is inside of this tunnel. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5261.46s)]
*  And these are all buried at Soxie, Oman. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5263.66s)]
*  So there's like skulls everywhere. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5265.14s)]
*  There's boxes and all these bones. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5266.66s)]
*  There was a there was like an obsidian [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5268.46s)]
*  mirror with like a little stick on it, a bunch of gold artifacts in this room. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5271.3s)]
*  It was just boxes upon boxes upon boxes upon boxes. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5274.74s)]
*  And I haven't seen any of this stuff published yet. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5277.860000000001s)]
*  So this is how much of a delay there is on archaeology. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5280.58s)]
*  And what is the delay in that stuff? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5284.7s)]
*  Because it would seem like such an enormous discovery. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5287.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's what I think it is is, well, you kind of have [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5291.38s)]
*  I would I would say it's a mix of a lot of different things. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5297.42s)]
*  Let's say let's say the most non malicious side [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5300.74s)]
*  is that these countries are totally dependent upon tourism [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5304.98s)]
*  and they want to prepare like a media, you know, [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5308.46s)]
*  like a big media buzz to drive tourism. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5311.660000000001s)]
*  So they want to do it at the right time of the year. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5314.14s)]
*  And then it'll inspire people to book their trip down down to the Sacred Valley. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5316.5s)]
*  You know, it's all it's about it's a money making machine, right? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5320.46s)]
*  It's it's it's their biggest draw to come and see this part of the world. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5323.700000000001s)]
*  It seems so counterintuitive because new discoveries would make people want to visit. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5327.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. They just want to hold it off to like the right part of the year. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5331.820000000001s)]
*  This is this is something I've heard in Peru. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5335.58s)]
*  This is something I've heard in Egypt. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5337.3s)]
*  You know, the do you remember the tomb of Tutmos, the second [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5339.22s)]
*  that was just discovered recently? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5344.34s)]
*  I heard about that. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5347.02s)]
*  So let me think that that came out two or three months ago. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5348.5s)]
*  And when I was there in October, I had heard that that it was that it was found. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5351.26s)]
*  So so these things are happening way, way in advance. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5355.38s)]
*  Now, the other side is there's sort of this Zahi was effect like [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5357.860000000001s)]
*  like Ed Barnhart, my professor mentor. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5362.62s)]
*  He wanted to study in Peru whether or not the Inca or ancient Peruvians [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5366.7s)]
*  are like fusing these andesite stones together. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5374.02s)]
*  So you've seen how they how the stones like fit together [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5377.54s)]
*  in the same way that they do at the Valley Temple in Egypt, the red granite. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5380.38s)]
*  So they're using this gray andesite, which is sometimes the andesite [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5384.06s)]
*  is harder than the granite in Egypt. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5387.46s)]
*  And they're they're like morphing these stones together at impossible angles. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5389.66s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen the 12 sided stone and maybe you've seen the scoop marks [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5394.58s)]
*  on the side of the stone where it looks like the outside of the stone [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5398.14s)]
*  was softened at one point and you could like scrape a piece off. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5400.62s)]
*  And so it's it's Dr. Barnhart's idea that somehow. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5403.900000000001s)]
*  Well, it's not without evidence. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5409.9400000000005s)]
*  So in the Chilean desert, the Inca are building upon the Inca Empire. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5411.1s)]
*  We're building upon roads that went all across South America. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5415.42s)]
*  And these roads weren't initially the foundations weren't laid by the Inca. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5418.54s)]
*  They may have been improved by the Inca, but they go back to the Warre Empire, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5422.18s)]
*  which predates the Inca. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5425.42s)]
*  And it almost certainly goes back further than this. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5426.900000000001s)]
*  The southernmost point of these highways, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5430.02s)]
*  it goes off into the Chilean desert, into the Atacama Desert, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5432.18s)]
*  and they just kind of disappear into the desert. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5435.14s)]
*  And for a long time, it's been a mystery of what the heck are these Peruvians [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5436.740000000001s)]
*  doing down in the Chilean desert? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5441.38s)]
*  What is it down there? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5443.62s)]
*  What's a resource that they need? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5444.700000000001s)]
*  But there are these there are these acid deposits that are down in that desert. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5446.06s)]
*  And somehow they invented somehow they invented this clay pottery that [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5449.74s)]
*  whatever they used to make it, the acid wouldn't melt through the pottery. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5455.62s)]
*  So you could carry it. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5458.46s)]
*  There's evidence of this at Tiwanaku as well, which I'm sure you've heard of Tiwanaku. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5460.38s)]
*  There's evidence of this of this acid at Tiwanaku. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5465.46s)]
*  And people would talk about how the how the acid could like melt the stones. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5467.82s)]
*  And sometimes you talk about how like bird poop or bird. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5472.139999999999s)]
*  I don't even know, like throw up or whatever could could melt the stone. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5475.62s)]
*  And so there's all these ideas that are these myth myths about the stones melting. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5478.66s)]
*  Anyways, Dr. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5483.34s)]
*  Barnhart's idea was that was that those roads go down there [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5484.34s)]
*  because they are mining and collecting the acids and they're bringing it back [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5487.5s)]
*  and they're softening the outside of the stone. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5490.9800000000005s)]
*  And rather than carving the stones to fit together, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5493.3s)]
*  they're setting the stones on top of each other and it's creating its own morph. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5495.82s)]
*  If that makes sense, the stones are morphing together. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5499.74s)]
*  And so he there's two reasons, but you see them a lot as to why he thinks this. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5502.46s)]
*  There was an earthquake in 1650 that destroyed the Spanish city [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5509.26s)]
*  that was sitting on top of the Inca city of Cusco. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5512.9400000000005s)]
*  So you have this ancient city that's there and the stones are so massive, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5515.38s)]
*  the Spanish couldn't tear them all down. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5518.66s)]
*  So they just gave up and they built new buildings over it. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5520.02s)]
*  In 1650, this horrific earthquake knocked down the Spanish city [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5522.7s)]
*  and ancient buildings were still there, hadn't moved at all. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5526.9800000000005s)]
*  In 1950, another earthquake happened, knocked down the Spanish city [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5530.06s)]
*  and the the ancient city is still standing. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5534.14s)]
*  So now these are preserved as cultural heritage monuments and they don't build over them. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5536.7s)]
*  But they like like a Starbucks or a KFC or a McDonald's [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5541.78s)]
*  will be built inside of an ancient Inca building. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5545.78s)]
*  You'll walk in and it's like megalithic stonework inside of KFC. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5547.82s)]
*  It's amazing. Wow. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5551.5s)]
*  But it's everywhere. It's the whole city. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5553.62s)]
*  It's the whole modern city. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5555.139999999999s)]
*  When you go one day, you just walk, walk, walk, walk. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5556.58s)]
*  One of the projects we're going to do for the Maya Exploration Center [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5558.86s)]
*  is I'm going to go down to Cusco for a month and I'm going to make [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5561.74s)]
*  the world's first map of where all the stones actually are. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5565.18s)]
*  There is a map that tourists get, but it's a shitty map. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5569.42s)]
*  It's not even accurate. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5571.780000000001s)]
*  So that's one of my projects is I'm going to map all of these stones [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5572.9400000000005s)]
*  and where they are around Cusco and it'll be like on an app or a website [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5576.54s)]
*  or something where you can find it. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5580.26s)]
*  But yeah, it's it's just it's incredible. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5582.5s)]
*  So they preserve the stones. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5585.1s)]
*  And so when you're walking around, getting back to why we see some images [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5587.22s)]
*  of stones that would indicate that they possibly were melted. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5590.9s)]
*  Like, what's like the best man? How could you search this up? [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5595.7s)]
*  Maybe just look up [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5598.259999999999s)]
*  Cusco cyclopean stones. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5600.66s)]
*  We may be able to find an image and I could show you something on my phone. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5603.66s)]
*  I know I've got it on my phone. OK. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5606.42s)]
*  Maybe I could send it to you, but I'll actually send it. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5608.86s)]
*  Send me the photo. And not these. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5610.86s)]
*  So so some of these are from Soxie woman. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5613.86s)]
*  OK, so to the top left here, so that's the 12 sided stone. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5616.54s)]
*  It's on this building. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5619.98s)]
*  When you walk around this building, the name is escaping me right now. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5621.74s)]
*  It's the palace of it's the palace of something. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5624.86s)]
*  When you walk around this, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5627.9s)]
*  when you walk around this building, you're going to see some of the stones [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5629.7s)]
*  where earthquake has separated. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5632.62s)]
*  So you have two stones that sit perfectly on top of each other. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5634.78s)]
*  Well, and when an earthquake happens, one of these stones will slide back. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5637.22s)]
*  And when it does, you'll see an angle that ramps up like this up to the exterior. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5640.58s)]
*  And so what it looks like is the stone is placed on top [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5645.0599999999995s)]
*  and it's smushed the stone down. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5647.86s)]
*  Does that make sense? Whoa. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5649.98s)]
*  Man, I if we searched hard enough, we could find it here. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5652.0599999999995s)]
*  I will send you this photo. I've got it on my phone. Wow. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5655.38s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5659.9s)]
*  Just that idea is fascinating. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5663.0599999999995s)]
*  And so melted into place. Yeah. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5665.5s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5668.58s)]
*  So they cut these stones used as this is the theory. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5671.98s)]
*  Is that it right there? No. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5675.5s)]
*  No. So they cut these stones, use the acid and set them in to seal [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5676.82s)]
*  so that there is no gap in between the stones. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5683.54s)]
*  So it's not that they have to carve it perfectly, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5685.98s)]
*  but rather that the weight of the other stone, they get it roughly [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5688.179999999999s)]
*  the right shape and then and then lay them down on top of each other. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5691.38s)]
*  It's on it's on one of these walls. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5696.259999999999s)]
*  So that one you have your cursor on. That's fake. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5697.66s)]
*  I walked up to it and it's like hollow. I was like tapping on it. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5699.46s)]
*  It's just a fake wall. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5702.219999999999s)]
*  Some I don't know why in Cusco they have some [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5704.5s)]
*  some people will decorate their walls to make them look like those cyclopean walls. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5707.3s)]
*  You go knock on it and it's like plastic. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5710.78s)]
*  But there's tons and tons and tons and tons. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5712.7s)]
*  The majority of the city is just the ancient city. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5714.7s)]
*  What is this? Inka Stone Monument irreparably damaged. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5716.94s)]
*  It's like someone cut out a piece of it. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5719.86s)]
*  Yeah. Somebody went up to it in the middle of the night, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5721.34s)]
*  like a drunk tourist and started hitting it with a hammer. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5723.02s)]
*  The 12 sided stone, which is like the most sacred stone in Cusco. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5725.74s)]
*  Yeah. Fucking gross. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5730.46s)]
*  Yeah. OK. So so you see this long the stone of the 12 angles. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5732.86s)]
*  I wonder if they're in the middle. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5736.54s)]
*  That stone is in that alley right there. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5737.7s)]
*  If you could find it. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5739.82s)]
*  But, you know, it's so crazy. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5741.38s)]
*  There's a building on top of that. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5743.38s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5746.3s)]
*  That's what's so weird about it. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5747.78s)]
*  Like, look at this stupid house that's falling apart. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5749.06s)]
*  That's on top of these ancient stones. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5752.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's crazy, man. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5755.34s)]
*  It's it's an amazing place. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5757.5s)]
*  You'll walk around and just be consistently stunned [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5759.38s)]
*  by the amount of stonework that's there and what they are able to achieve. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5762.62s)]
*  And this kind of cyclopean stonework where the stones all have these, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5766.5s)]
*  you know, no two stones are exactly alike. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5770.5s)]
*  You see that stonework in one place [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5774.54s)]
*  in Egypt, which is at the Valley Temple next to the Sphinx. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5778.54s)]
*  And you don't see that, as far as I know, recreated anywhere else. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5783.3s)]
*  But in Peru, it's everywhere. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5786.9800000000005s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. So that's kind of a repaired wall. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5790.9400000000005s)]
*  You can see that it fell apart and they put it back up. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5793.1s)]
*  But these are these are mortarless buildings. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5796.54s)]
*  Oh, hey, go go. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5798.74s)]
*  If you go just one below the one that you're at right now. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5800.22s)]
*  So this is the Temple of the Moon at Machu Picchu. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5802.66s)]
*  Look at the size of this of the of the stone wall. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5805.02s)]
*  That's one stone on the lower on the lower part of it. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5807.78s)]
*  And you can see that the size of the stones that are together [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5810.74s)]
*  is as earthquakes have rattled the city. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5813.42s)]
*  The wall still kind of holds together. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5816.14s)]
*  It bends and holds together completely mortarless. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5818.66s)]
*  It's just fascinating. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5821.06s)]
*  And on top of that, Machu Picchu itself, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5822.42s)]
*  60 percent of the megalithic construction work is in the foundation of Machu Picchu. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5826.900000000001s)]
*  So it's underneath what you're seeing. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5832.14s)]
*  And and there are areas that are roped off where you can go down, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5834.06s)]
*  like underneath the city, but it's all roped off. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5837.5s)]
*  And I I don't know a lot about it. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5839.900000000001s)]
*  I got I got a little bit of a photo of where you can go down into these. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5843.18s)]
*  I don't think I think they're like manmade labyrinths [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5846.66s)]
*  that are underneath the city, but there's a lot more there. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5848.74s)]
*  And so when you're there, you just get this like intrigue. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5851.66s)]
*  And and I was curious how Egypt would stack up because I did. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5854.0199999999995s)]
*  I did Peru last year. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5857.98s)]
*  And then the day I landed from Peru, I headed off to Egypt for a month. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5861.219999999999s)]
*  And then what a life. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5864.58s)]
*  Yeah, it was. You got a great life, dude. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5866.299999999999s)]
*  That's cool. Yeah. Well, thank you. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5868.379999999999s)]
*  That's really cool. It's just how far is this from Nazca? [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5869.9s)]
*  Very far. Peru is deceivingly big. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5874.259999999999s)]
*  Peru is like half the size of the United States. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5876.82s)]
*  Really? It's really, really big. Wow. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5879.82s)]
*  Yeah. I had no idea. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5882.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. The Nazca lines are really, really, really far away. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5883.58s)]
*  It's very hard to do a [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5886.86s)]
*  you can't do. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5890.34s)]
*  A tour of like all of Peru, it's too big. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5892.34s)]
*  It would be like it would be like if you were going to go on a United States tour, [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5895.5s)]
*  you would have to pick a place to go because it's just so massive. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5898.7s)]
*  Usually when people like do a tour of Peru, they'll pick like Paracas, Nazca. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5902.3s)]
*  You know, you pick these desert coastline areas and you go see that, [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5907.62s)]
*  because to get from there to the Sacred Valley is quite a journey. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5911.82s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It would take it takes like a day and a half of consistently [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5916.78s)]
*  traveling to actually get there. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5919.98s)]
*  Have you seen the new scans of the Nazca lines where they've found new petroglyphs? [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5921.94s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5926.5s)]
*  The man, there's going to be so much like that that's going to be found. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5927.7s)]
*  People are going to be able to fly these. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5931.099999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, it's amazing. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5933.78s)]
*  Like how exactly one, what's the inspiration [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5935.0199999999995s)]
*  for making these giant? [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5939.66s)]
*  You know, the sophistication is in the planning and the math behind [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5942.26s)]
*  how exactly you make these [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5946.0599999999995s)]
*  how exactly you make these images in the ground that are miles wide [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5948.74s)]
*  and very intricate, like if you look at the spider, the spider, [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5953.3s)]
*  there's a spider there that's anatomically correct for a local spider that's there. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5956.58s)]
*  And there's some aspect about the spider and a detail that they incorporate [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5959.86s)]
*  that you would only know if you were like really studying these little creatures [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5963.22s)]
*  and wanted to recreate it on a massive scale. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5966.7s)]
*  But the legs, man, they're they're mapping. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5968.62s)]
*  I mean, look, this is this is an enormous thing in the ground [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5970.86s)]
*  that if you don't have flight, you're never going to be able to know [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5974.82s)]
*  that you did it that you did it precisely, right? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5978.3s)]
*  Or unless you had very meticulous planning and everything. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5981.0599999999995s)]
*  But again, what's the inspiration for this? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5984.34s)]
*  What's the inspiration? Why would you be doing this? [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5985.98s)]
*  What is this for? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5988.46s)]
*  Why does it have that one leg that hooks off to the left? [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5989.26s)]
*  I don't know. See that that one lengthened piece. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5992.34s)]
*  Very strange. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5996.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, you know, the Nazca, they [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=5996.66s)]
*  the the exact timeline of their civilization is a little bit blurry. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6000.98s)]
*  But I mean, they had they had disappeared more than a thousand years [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6005.82s)]
*  before the Spanish arrived. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6009.22s)]
*  Jamie, can I ask you, what is that all about? [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6010.3s)]
*  Why does it have all those additional lines? [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6011.98s)]
*  I don't know. Someone's doing different. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6013.66s)]
*  I don't know. Is that just art? [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6016.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think they're making it on [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6017.9s)]
*  maybe one of those sand tables or something like that. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6020.3s)]
*  Be a cool T-shirt. Mm hmm. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6021.94s)]
*  There's other weird ones, like the one that looks like an astronaut. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6024.46s)]
*  Yeah, he does. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6027.9400000000005s)]
*  I actually think that that's a I actually think that's a pulpa line, [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6028.86s)]
*  which is it's a different culture that does the same thing. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6031.9400000000005s)]
*  If you if you look up pulpa lines, you may be able to see there's quite a few of them. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6035.14s)]
*  Look at that one, the jester one, the one with the antenna on the upper left. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6038.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Look at him. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6041.74s)]
*  No, no, no. I know that. Yeah, there it is. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6042.78s)]
*  Like that one. Where does that come from? [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6045.38s)]
*  Can't make it that big. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6046.9800000000005s)]
*  Make it a little smaller. There you go. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6048.34s)]
*  What is that? [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6050.1s)]
*  And why does it? [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6051.18s)]
*  What's that? This is AI on. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6052.98s)]
*  Oh, are they? Yes. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6054.459999999999s)]
*  But this is OK. I'm sorry. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6055.74s)]
*  This is the AI. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6057.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, wait, look at the shark. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6057.9s)]
*  Look at the shark on there. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6059.5s)]
*  Isn't that cool? So you have seafaring, dude. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6061.379999999999s)]
*  OK. Do you know of Vanapu in in Easter Island? [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6063.86s)]
*  It's I think it's called Vanapu. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6069.139999999999s)]
*  It's this platform building that on Easter Island with all the big heads. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6071.179999999999s)]
*  That is the exact same architecture as what we're seeing in Peru. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6075.78s)]
*  These people are traveling out into the Pacific Ocean and back. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6079.139999999999s)]
*  You know, it just it's it's fascinating, man. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6083.0199999999995s)]
*  Thor hired all with Contiki. He proved it. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6086.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there we go. Yeah. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6088.219999999999s)]
*  So, you know, it's falling apart. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6089.66s)]
*  It's not the same stone. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6091.179999999999s)]
*  It's a it's a local volcanic sandstone. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6092.66s)]
*  I think I don't think that this is basalt. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6096.339999999999s)]
*  It might be basalt, but it's a volcanic. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6098.54s)]
*  It's a volcanic stone. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6101.099999999999s)]
*  I'm actually pretty sure it's basalt. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6102.259999999999s)]
*  It's made of the same thing of the Easter Island heads. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6103.58s)]
*  So you have this Vanapu, but [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6107.58s)]
*  another project that that my exploration center is working on later [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6110.74s)]
*  this year is we're going down to [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6114.7s)]
*  make a new updated map, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6118.219999999999s)]
*  archaeological map of Easter Island, Rapa Nui. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6120.0599999999995s)]
*  And I'm not going, but it's Dr. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6122.86s)]
*  Barnhart doing it. And there's another site down on the remote end of the island [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6124.86s)]
*  where there's another structure like this that you never see mentioned. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6129.62s)]
*  And so that we're going to document that and put that out. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6133.219999999999s)]
*  So there's no doubt that, I mean, these people are incredibly advanced, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6136.5s)]
*  incredibly connected, incredibly intelligent. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6140.26s)]
*  And it's just so mysterious. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6142.74s)]
*  OK, do you know of the Blythe lines? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6144.82s)]
*  Have you heard of this? Blythe, California. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6146.66s)]
*  There are there are Nazca lines up there. Really? [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6148.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, we should look this up. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6151.34s)]
*  Yeah. So where's Blythe? [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6153.38s)]
*  Oh, I think it's right before you get to Nevada. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6155.14s)]
*  You're like driving. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6158.42s)]
*  So if you if you you'll pass right by it, if you're driving from Las Vegas [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6159.34s)]
*  into California, I think. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6163.06s)]
*  So Blythe lines. Yeah. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6166.14s)]
*  We should. Yeah, we should zoom in from Google Earth. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6167.780000000001s)]
*  This would be cool. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6169.3s)]
*  Where is it, Jimmy? It's on the 10th. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6171.620000000001s)]
*  It's on the 10th. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6173.5s)]
*  I was trying to write where my cursor is. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6174.860000000001s)]

*  You might be able to look up Blythe lines. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6178.700000000001s)]
*  I did, but I'm OK. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6180.580000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to show you where it was. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6181.780000000001s)]
*  Oh, sorry. So these are the. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6183.5s)]
*  Oh, well, yeah, they're huge. Whoa. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6185.22s)]
*  So, dude, this is not the fuck is that this? [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6189.58s)]
*  This is I mean, to me, it's pretty obvious [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6193.9s)]
*  that there are people who are and this is they think that this is younger [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6198.14s)]
*  than the Nazca lines. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6203.46s)]
*  But even if it is, it's pretty obvious to me that you have traders [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6205.0199999999995s)]
*  and you have people who are very capable of traveling all up [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6208.9s)]
*  and down the Americas, it's all interconnected. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6213.26s)]
*  And I think these lines exist. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6215.74s)]
*  It's it's not really majorly studied, [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6218.42s)]
*  but I think that there's a few of these of these images that are out there [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6221.299999999999s)]
*  and more that are further off into the desert that some people have. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6224.58s)]
*  One of them was a monkey. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6227.78s)]
*  How do they even know what monkeys are? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6229.7s)]
*  Well, OK, here's that's a great that's a great question. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6231.98s)]
*  There were there monkeys in California. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6235.82s)]
*  No, I doubt it. But there are. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6238.219999999999s)]
*  An idea of how this could happen is so at Teotihuacan, like I was talking to you, [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6240.74s)]
*  this is an hour north of Mexico City. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6245.259999999999s)]
*  There were monkeys that we have found that were in zoos in Teotihuacan, [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6247.9400000000005s)]
*  like like dead monkeys that are buried. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6252.34s)]
*  And this species of monkey is only found in the southern Amazon. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6254.42s)]
*  So it's all the way up in northern Mexico. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6257.900000000001s)]
*  So all of these things are connected. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6260.42s)]
*  OK, another another. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6263.18s)]
*  OK, Jamie, can we look up please for clarity? [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6265.900000000001s)]
*  I want was a Nazca line. The monkey was not in the California. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6268.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, OK, OK. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6271.66s)]
*  That makes sense. Came up. OK. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6273.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those monkeys are in Peru. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6275.7s)]
*  Well, even so, there are there are Amazonian monkeys that are coming. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6277.46s)]
*  What's the other blithe lines are? [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6280.42s)]
*  The article started showing different stuff [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6283.3s)]
*  because explaining what they were. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6284.66s)]
*  So comparisons to NASA found in 1932 by pilot. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6286.02s)]
*  That's what I was trying to figure out. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6290.14s)]
*  So that's one of those like a giraffe. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6291.26s)]
*  There's a sort of defense around the deer. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6294.5s)]
*  Yeah, it could be a deer. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6296.74s)]
*  But our deer are our deer out there quadruped. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6298.1s)]
*  Well, there's deer in California for sure. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6302.42s)]
*  There's probably be mule deer in that part of the country. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6304.54s)]
*  There certainly is in Nevada. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6310.06s)]
*  Nevada has a big population of deer. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6312.3s)]
*  California's figure represents horses reintroduced [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6314.94s)]
*  store for sometime after the 1500s. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6317.78s)]
*  So maybe they don't know when these scroll up. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6319.54s)]
*  Yeah, they have no idea. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6321.22s)]
*  Oh, that's a horse doesn't look like a horse to me. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6324.14s)]
*  I think the tail, though, is a lot longer than a. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6326.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. A little a deer. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6329.14s)]
*  They've got the little tail like a shitty artist. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6330.42s)]
*  I was stumbling down something with the Olmec stuff. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6333.38s)]
*  I think it was the Olmec. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6336.38s)]
*  There is a bunch of this guy, see a zoom worse here. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6337.900000000001s)]
*  There's a bunch of other weird rocks that had like. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6340.14s)]
*  Anthropomorphized animals playing on top of humans. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6344.18s)]
*  OK, do you know about have you ever heard of where Jaguars? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6347.820000000001s)]
*  No. Oh, dude, this is like this is my shit. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6351.660000000001s)]
*  OK, so where Jaguars? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6354.780000000001s)]
*  It is another piece of evidence of at least. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6358.34s)]
*  Well, the lower part of North America connecting with the Amazon. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6362.74s)]
*  Oh, dude, this is this is bad ass. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6365.78s)]
*  All right. So. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6368.38s)]
*  So the very first some of the first evidence that we have of people in the Americas. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6370.820000000001s)]
*  So you think of like, where do you where do you imagine that people migrate [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6375.02s)]
*  into the Americas? Like, where do you think we would find the first evidence at? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6378.54s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6382.46s)]
*  Well, I would imagine be somewhere where the Olmecs were. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6388.26s)]
*  Yeah, maybe so. Yeah. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6391.22s)]
*  Or, you know, traditionally. Sure, sure. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6392.78s)]
*  Traditionally, people think that maybe you would find it, you know, in Alaska. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6395.54s)]
*  Coming in. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6400.26s)]
*  You know, people migrating over during or before and after the ice age. Sure. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6403.1s)]
*  Or I'm sorry, during and before the ice age. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6407.7s)]
*  And then some people might think that, you know, you have Polynesians [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6410.06s)]
*  that are skipping across the Pacific that are coming into. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6412.7s)]
*  But most of the time, it's West Coast. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6416.18s)]
*  You'd find people think you'd find something out there. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6418.26s)]
*  Some of the oldest evidence that we have are 30,000 year old caves [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6420.94s)]
*  on the east side of the Amazon, on the east side, the opposite side of the Americas, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6425.14s)]
*  as far away as you can possibly get from, you know, where people [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6430.3s)]
*  would have traditionally arrived in the Americas. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6434.94s)]
*  Now, that evidence is constantly changing. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6437.5s)]
*  There's constantly new things that are being found, like white sands. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6439.42s)]
*  And there's what a hundred and one hundred and fifty thousand year old [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6442.0199999999995s)]
*  like bone tools or chisels that are being found where people were [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6445.34s)]
*  cutting into woolly mammoth bones, you know, crazy stuff. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6448.58s)]
*  But one of these old evidences is people in the Amazon [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6451.26s)]
*  20 to 30 thousand years ago on the east coast in Brazil, on the Atlantic coast. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6455.98s)]
*  And they have these. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6461.1s)]
*  I think it may have been Teddy Roosevelt's granddaughter that found this. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6463.18s)]
*  She was she was a South American archaeologist. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6467.74s)]
*  She was inspired to go to the Amazon. And so. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6469.5s)]
*  It's really interesting in the Olmec realm. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6475.0599999999995s)]
*  There's what's called a were jaguar. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6478.7s)]
*  It's just like a it's like a werewolf spelt, you know, sort of the same. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6480.74s)]
*  But you have this you have these two different dichotomies in the Olmec world. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6484.98s)]
*  You have the Olmec heads, which, by the way, I brought you a head. Oh, nice. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6488.18s)]
*  More stuff for this table. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6494.0599999999995s)]
*  Sit right next to hecklefish. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6497.5s)]
*  So this is made from basalt by the modern Olmec people. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6501.86s)]
*  Whoa, that's cool. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6504.94s)]
*  Yeah, super cool. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6507.78s)]
*  So these guys, thank you. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6509.379999999999s)]
*  These guys, we don't know who they are. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6512.219999999999s)]
*  We don't know exactly what they represent, [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6513.98s)]
*  because they're they're just guys with normal faces. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6516.7s)]
*  You know, they have Olmec faces, but they're all wearing this helmet. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6520.179999999999s)]
*  What the hell does the helmet mean? [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6523.58s)]
*  It could be two different things. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6525.94s)]
*  It's a signature of their divine, like, rulership, like, like [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6527.0599999999995s)]
*  we think they might be kings, somebody who can, you know, somebody [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6530.62s)]
*  who can commission a monument this big. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6533.7s)]
*  This is a testament to his power. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6535.34s)]
*  Or these are revered ballgame players, the Mesoamerican ballgame. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6537.34s)]
*  I'm sure you've dove into this a little bit. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6541.22s)]
*  Or it's both that the, you know, the most masculine thing [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6543.5s)]
*  that you can be is a great Mesoamerican ballgame player. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6548.46s)]
*  And that's the king. He wants to see himself out of it. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6550.9s)]
*  It's the same thing as Marcus Aurelius' son. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6552.42s)]
*  Why am I forgetting his name? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6556.26s)]
*  The really bad emperor. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6558.26s)]
*  God, I can't remember his name. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6560.7s)]
*  But anyways, he wanted to be seen like Hercules fighting in the Coliseum. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6561.58s)]
*  And so we think this might be a kind of similar thing. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6565.42s)]
*  There's a whole different type of people that are existing in the Olmec realm. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6568.86s)]
*  We can look up Olmec where Jaguar, please, Jamie. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6573.74s)]
*  Thank you. And there's a whole different type of person. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6578.94s)]
*  So here's one image. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6582.14s)]
*  If you keep scrolling, you'll see images that are carved into. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6583.18s)]
*  So this is a little bit of a better image right here. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6587.94s)]
*  But sometimes when they're carved into Jade and you can see the light [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6590.02s)]
*  reflecting off of it, you get a better you get a better [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6592.700000000001s)]
*  image of what these things really look like. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6597.34s)]
*  So where Jaguar Olmec and maybe do Jade. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6599.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah, there we go. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6602.820000000001s)]
*  Top top right. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6603.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, check that guy out. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6606.42s)]
*  So that's so that's a human. That's not an animal. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6607.900000000001s)]
*  It is a human who has turned into the essence of a Jaguar. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6610.580000000001s)]
*  And we see this everywhere, all over the Olmec world. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6615.42s)]
*  But they're never the colossal heads. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6618.42s)]
*  They're always in Jade or they're smaller Olmec monuments. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6620.3s)]
*  And sometimes the heads are [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6623.58s)]
*  sometimes the heads are are maimed, like that. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6627.22s)]
*  The head is just completely destroyed. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6630.86s)]
*  And there's these Jaguar claw claws that are carved into an Olmec face, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6632.3s)]
*  like tearing apart its face, tearing apart the symbol that's on the top of their head. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6636.7s)]
*  And so a lot of people wonder, like, why are these scratch marks [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6641.18s)]
*  in all of these Olmec monuments? [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6644.26s)]
*  But all the scratch marks only appear in Olmec monuments that are not the where Jaguar. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6646.14s)]
*  And so what I think this is a little bit of research I'm doing. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6651.58s)]
*  And I'm writing a book on the Olmecs right now is what I think is [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6654.58s)]
*  there's a feud between the rulers and the shamanic class. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6657.660000000001s)]
*  And I think that these where Jaguar people, these people who are taking [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6662.26s)]
*  some kind of hallucinogen, taking a psychedelic and and basically imbuing [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6665.46s)]
*  the essence of a Jaguar in some strange, crazy way that we can't explain. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6670.3s)]
*  These are feuding with each other. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6675.78s)]
*  And when I'm in Mexico and I'm in these museums [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6677.14s)]
*  where you have these mushroom stone effigies that are all lined up, [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6681.82s)]
*  I'll ask a local archaeologist there. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6685.46s)]
*  I'll be like, so these mushrooms, do you think that these depict [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6688.18s)]
*  hallucinogens that people that they may have been taking to get high? [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6691.3s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6694.02s)]
*  I'm like, really? You don't like you look at all the crazy shit [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6696.26s)]
*  that ancient Americans are making. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6699.66s)]
*  If you look at ancient American artwork anywhere, you can tell it's all like [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6701.34s)]
*  mind bending stuff to look at. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6705.0199999999995s)]
*  They're clearly I think they're being influenced by plants. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6707.0199999999995s)]
*  Now, this where Jaguar isn't just isolated to the Olmec world. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6710.5s)]
*  It also pops up at a place called Chavín de Wontar. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6714.94s)]
*  Have you ever heard of this? No. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6718.179999999999s)]
*  This is in the Andes. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6719.42s)]
*  It's one of the oldest cities in the Andes. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6720.42s)]
*  So before Chavín, we can follow the DNA evidence of burials. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6722.26s)]
*  Like you can tell, OK, these these people are younger. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6726.38s)]
*  If we carbon date their bodies that are buried underneath these temples [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6729.0199999999995s)]
*  and they're related to these people that are older. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6732.26s)]
*  So you're trying to piece together this DNA web, but it's very, very loose. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6734.46s)]
*  So there's a place called [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6739.5s)]
*  there's a culture called Kerala Supe culture, and they are building [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6741.22s)]
*  pyramids before the old kingdom of Egypt ever even existed. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6745.58s)]
*  This is this is five thousand five hundred years ago, at least [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6749.14s)]
*  on the coast of Peru, like right on the beach. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6752.9800000000005s)]
*  And there's like 15 huge pyramids out there. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6755.18s)]
*  But this is a non pottery, non artistic culture. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6757.86s)]
*  So we don't have pottery and we don't have art from them. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6762.34s)]
*  And we don't have stone statues or anything like that, just these structures. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6764.9800000000005s)]
*  And from what we can tell, they keep getting hit by these like apocalyptic storms, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6768.18s)]
*  these tropical El Ninos and La Niñas that are just destroying their civilization. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6772.22s)]
*  And they're trying to to rebuild it again. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6776.5s)]
*  And eventually they say, you know what? Forget this. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6779.06s)]
*  We're moving up into the Andes. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6781.22s)]
*  Well, when they move up into the Andes on Chavín de Wontar, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6782.820000000001s)]
*  they then come in contact with Amazonians. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6786.5s)]
*  They meet Amazonians for the first time. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6788.860000000001s)]
*  And all of a sudden, these people, they have pottery, they have art, they have gods, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6790.42s)]
*  they have a pantheon, they have stone statues and they are where jaguars. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6794.14s)]
*  They they are these shamanic people. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6799.1s)]
*  Oh, this is from. Oh, this is is this on my ex? Oh, cool. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6801.42s)]
*  So so I posted about this today. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6805.54s)]
*  So these faces right here, [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6808.3s)]
*  these are on the side of the temple of Chavín that faces east off into the Amazon. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6811.82s)]
*  And when you look at Chavín pottery, it's the same as Amazonian pottery in the region. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6817.54s)]
*  So the people of the Andes, as soon as they interact with the Amazon, they take they [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6821.82s)]
*  acquire this religion, this culture, this iconography. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6827.1s)]
*  They completely change as a people and they start building [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6832.18s)]
*  the first structures that we know of that have interiors, [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6836.46s)]
*  because before this, these pyramids that were out on the coastline, [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6839.58s)]
*  you're like walking on top of this big stone mound. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6842.94s)]
*  But at Chavín, it's a it's a huge square style building [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6845.9s)]
*  that you can that has open doors that you can walk in through. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6850.66s)]
*  And all of this happens as soon as they interact with Amazonians. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6853.74s)]
*  And so, yeah, so this is it's a huge structure. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6857.3s)]
*  And the the stones that make up the staircases. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6863.46s)]
*  Oh, my God. OK, have you seen the name is escaping me right now. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6866.139999999999s)]
*  But but wandering wolf went out there, Michael Collins, and he found that [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6869.82s)]
*  he saw these big Trilith on stones that are sitting on the side of the mountain [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6875.26s)]
*  in Peru. Do you remember this giant stones? [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6878.18s)]
*  That white stone is the same white stone that's used in the staircases [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6881.26s)]
*  and on the door jams and the lentils here at Chavín. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6885.26s)]
*  So you see that the open door right there at the bottom. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6888.06s)]
*  Yeah. So those white stones on the side, those stones may have come from that quarry [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6891.18s)]
*  that he went and visited where those gigantic, you know, Trilith on ball back [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6896.38s)]
*  size stones. It's really, really far from here. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6900.7s)]
*  I don't I don't know. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6903.94s)]
*  That would be something good that I should know. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6905.0199999999995s)]
*  So some of its megalithic, some of its decent size. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6908.62s)]
*  It's really that front wall right there with that entrance, the steps going up to it. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6910.86s)]
*  And then on the inside of the temple, you have the megalithic stonework. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6915.0599999999995s)]
*  And then you have this then you have this monolith on the inside. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6918.099999999999s)]
*  So you see this guy? Look at that. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6921.78s)]
*  That's that's a that's a human with jaguar fangs coming out of his mouth. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6923.58s)]
*  And all of these tenenheads that are on the side of the temple, [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6928.379999999999s)]
*  they're facing out towards the Amazon. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6931.0199999999995s)]
*  It's telling us that this religion, this idea of these people [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6932.9s)]
*  who are somehow doing these shamanic practices, which I think are so clearly, [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6936.98s)]
*  so obviously, that is plants like ayahuasca or whatever it is, [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6941.74s)]
*  inducing these people into a state of consciousness where somehow they're taking on [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6946.98s)]
*  the effects of the jaguar like you and Paul Rosalie talked about this. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6950.58s)]
*  And when he was talking about his [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6954.259999999999s)]
*  his experience with ayahuasca, I believe he said and maybe is on this show [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6956.46s)]
*  that for a moment, like he shrunk down to the size of an atom [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6960.139999999999s)]
*  and he's floating through the Amazon. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6963.38s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he was looking through like the eyes of a jaguar for a moment. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6964.86s)]
*  And this is something that constant theme amongst people done ayahuasca. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6968.5s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So this is something that I think I think it's I think it's evidence. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6972.0199999999995s)]
*  We can go we talk about this forever. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6977.5s)]
*  But I think there's so much evidence. Oh, isn't this cool? Yeah. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6978.9s)]
*  Well, there's also evidence that jaguars eat the same plants. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6982.219999999999s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Have you seen this on? [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6985.66s)]
*  What is it? Weird nature. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6988.38s)]
*  There's a documentary out there called Weird Nature. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6990.1s)]
*  Jaguars tripping. Yeah. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6992.66s)]
*  And and it like it makes it it makes it akin to like catnip. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6993.82s)]
*  And it's like the Jaguar also has it. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=6999.3s)]
*  This is why I brought this up. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7001.22s)]
*  Terrence Spaghett had a very fascinating theory about why ketamine [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7002.3s)]
*  in particular feels like an empty office building. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7006.82s)]
*  And his his theory is like ketamine is like you enter a realm, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7010.3s)]
*  but there's no one there. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7015.06s)]
*  And this is, by the way, he's talking about ketamine in like the 80s and 90s. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7016.66s)]
*  Whereas his theory is that when you imbibe, [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7021.0599999999995s)]
*  when you take a psychedelic medicine, when you take any sort of psychedelic plant, [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7027.0199999999995s)]
*  mushroom, whatever it is, you're not just having an experience. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7032.26s)]
*  You are also interacting with all of the experiences [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7036.62s)]
*  that have ever been had with these things, [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7041.42s)]
*  which is one of the reasons why when people take certain psychedelics, [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7044.099999999999s)]
*  they have very clear Egyptian iconography appears in their trip. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7048.3s)]
*  And his belief or his theory was that it's far more complex [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7054.38s)]
*  than you're taking a psychedelic drug. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7059.82s)]
*  You're taking this psychedelic that allows you to interact [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7061.86s)]
*  with all the experiences anyone has ever had with those. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7065.42s)]
*  Oh, wow. Including Jaguars. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7068.42s)]
*  Now, also, there's always been this conflict between the ruling class [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7071.0199999999995s)]
*  and this shamanic rituals. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7077.78s)]
*  This is the illucidium mysteries. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7079.9s)]
*  Yeah. They shut all that stuff down. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7081.86s)]
*  Absolutely. Would it make sense that the claw marks would represent the battle [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7083.299999999999s)]
*  between the shamans and these ruling class, who, of course, [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7089.339999999999s)]
*  don't want people tripping and opening their mind and questioning authority [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7093.74s)]
*  and trying to restructure everything? [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7098.1s)]
*  And it'd be a huge problem if you were a Zahi Hawass guy [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7099.700000000001s)]
*  trying to keep the lid on everything and just keep control and power. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7104.18s)]
*  And then you got all these people that are tripping balls [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7107.46s)]
*  that have completely different ideas that you have to silence that. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7110.3s)]
*  Well, what's the issue here? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7114.02s)]
*  The issue is these guys, they get together in a circle and they drink this stuff. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7115.18s)]
*  And they start having these wacky ideas. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7118.660000000001s)]
*  Let's put a stop to that. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7120.54s)]
*  Let's put it the same way they did with the illucidium mysteries, [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7121.9400000000005s)]
*  the same way they've done countless times. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7124.38s)]
*  Shamans that were like the whole Santa Claus things [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7126.74s)]
*  where he's coming down the chimney. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7129.62s)]
*  Why was that? [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7130.98s)]
*  Well, because Siberian shamans were ostracized. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7131.58s)]
*  They were forced to actually not go through the doorways [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7134.98s)]
*  because they had to sneak into people's homes. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7139.139999999999s)]
*  So they came down chimneys. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7141.22s)]
*  This is the theory. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7142.7s)]
*  Oh, that's fascinating. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7143.58s)]
*  Which is like, why the fuck would Santa come down a chimney? [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7144.74s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7146.78s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, that was the idea. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7147.66s)]
*  Like, shout Santa's a shaman. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7149.0199999999995s)]
*  Also, shout Santa, at least in modern depictions, [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7150.74s)]
*  has the exact same coloration as the Amanita muscaria mushroom. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7153.94s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7157.86s)]
*  You've never seen the comparison. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7158.94s)]
*  She's Santa and the mushroom. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7160.5s)]
*  No, no, no. The fascinating comparison. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7161.5s)]
*  And this is also hotly debated. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7163.219999999999s)]
*  You know, they say, no, well, Coca-Cola is the ones that made them red and white. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7164.9s)]
*  The Santa Claus is maybe. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7169.139999999999s)]
*  But there's old pictures of Christmas images [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7171.219999999999s)]
*  that always include elves and Amanita muscaria mushrooms. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7175.099999999999s)]
*  There's old Christmas cards from like the turn of the century. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7180.46s)]
*  There's old like Merry Christmas. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7183.94s)]
*  It's fucking mushrooms. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7185.74s)]
*  There's mushrooms everywhere. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7187.299999999999s)]
*  So mushrooms have a micro risal relationship with coniferous trees, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7189.099999999999s)]
*  particularly Amanita muscaria. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7194.299999999999s)]
*  You would find them underneath pine trees. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7196.139999999999s)]
*  The same way you find brightly colored presents under Christmas trees. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7199.74s)]
*  In order to dry them, they would pick these mushrooms [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7204.7s)]
*  and hang them in the trees so they would air dry, [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7208.66s)]
*  just like ornaments on a tree. Wow. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7212.259999999999s)]
*  There's so many parallels. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7214.82s)]
*  It's really weird. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7217.0599999999995s)]
*  The Santa was a mushroom one is a weird one. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7218.62s)]
*  It's a really weird one because there's a ton of them. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7221.66s)]
*  Like, why are we so interested in fucking pine trees? [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7224.259999999999s)]
*  Why is it? Well, those trees had this very connected relationship, [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7226.9s)]
*  which with those mushrooms. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7231.98s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, I find that. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7234.379999999999s)]
*  So you can find some of them ancient pictures of Christmas, [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7236.0199999999995s)]
*  ancient Merry Christmas images. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7239.66s)]
*  But this is like, yeah, look, that look, look at that shaman, [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7241.5s)]
*  that shaman to the left. Go back to scroll back. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7246.18s)]
*  Look out. Look at that Siberian shaman looks exactly like the coloration. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7248.34s)]
*  Wow. Of anatomy. I'm going to eat a mascara. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7252.94s)]
*  Now go to that Merry Christmas image that you have there right next to your cursor. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7254.9s)]
*  Look at that. I'm going to eat a mascara. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7257.94s)]
*  A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7260.62s)]
*  I'm going to eat a mascara image. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7263.3s)]
*  These women with good times, Christmas or these children rather with good times. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7265.26s)]
*  Christmas. Have you ever tried these mushrooms? [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7269.5s)]
*  Yes. Didn't work. Really? Yeah. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7271.1s)]
*  I think there's well, McKenna didn't have a good experience with them either. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7275.54s)]
*  And there's there's a lot of thoughts that he had about whether or not [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7280.18s)]
*  they were genetically variable, whether or not they're geographically [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7283.5s)]
*  and even seasonally variable, that you're not dealing with the same mushrooms. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7287.5s)]
*  Sort of like, you know, there's different version, like obviously manipulated, [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7291.820000000001s)]
*  but there's a very different version of banana that we're enjoying today. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7297.58s)]
*  Yeah. Versus the wild banana. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7301.1s)]
*  Oh, corn too. Yes. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7302.66s)]
*  Maize. Yes. So different. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7304.3s)]
*  A lot of different plants of like similar history. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7305.9s)]
*  It's what I mean, fungus is a very different thing, right? [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7309.1s)]
*  Because fungus actually breathe air. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7312.54s)]
*  They're not plants. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7314.7s)]
*  They're much closer to animals than they are to plants. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7315.98s)]
*  Oh, it's fascinating. Yeah, they're real weird. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7318.94s)]
*  And they're also really weird that they seem to be like the Internet for plants, [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7320.7s)]
*  like the micro riser relationship and the fact that they have this [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7325.42s)]
*  very bizarre network of mycelium that's under the ground. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7329.06s)]
*  Like the largest living organism is a mushroom colony that exists, [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7333.54s)]
*  I believe, in the Pacific Northwest. Oh, really? Yeah. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7338.5s)]
*  See if you can find that. Yeah. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7341.42s)]
*  So instead of like saying, oh, there's a mushroom that pops out of the ground. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7342.860000000001s)]
*  No, that's like the fruiting body of the entire thing. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7347.38s)]
*  The entire thing is enormous. Yeah. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7351.34s)]
*  And it's communicating with plants. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7354.179999999999s)]
*  It's helping the plants distribute and share resources. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7357.46s)]
*  It's helping them get information. It's very strange. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7361.219999999999s)]
*  You know, Paul Stamets is like the best guy to talk to about this stuff. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7364.339999999999s)]
*  He's a mycologist and that he actually gave me that big ass mushroom [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7368.179999999999s)]
*  at the end of the table. Oh, that's a mushroom. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7372.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. How they're weird. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7374.219999999999s)]
*  You know, this this whole conversation here, [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7377.58s)]
*  it is the largest organism on earth is a fungus. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7380.139999999999s)]
*  The blue whale is big, but nowhere near as huge as a sprawling fungus. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7383.099999999999s)]
*  Really? Eastern Oregon. Yeah. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7386.34s)]
*  Holy crap. Yeah. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7388.22s)]
*  And again, it fucking breathes air. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7389.62s)]
*  Could be as ancient as 800 as 8650 years. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7392.74s)]
*  Yeah. Good night. Good night. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7397.62s)]
*  Wild, wild stuff. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7400.86s)]
*  Yeah. And you know, this is what we know about, right? [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7403.34s)]
*  Like, what about what the fuck is in the Amazon? [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7405.66s)]
*  Oh, my God, man. Well, OK. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7407.94s)]
*  OK, so two things there as far as what's in the Amazon first. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7410.179999999999s)]
*  Think about how let's just talk about North America above Mesoamerica. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7412.58s)]
*  So like, let's just let's just include like the modern day United States. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7417.42s)]
*  Think about all the tribes that existed here, how complicated these histories are. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7421.22s)]
*  You know, Squanto is born in the early [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7425.1s)]
*  sixteen hundreds among these tribes in Massachusetts. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7428.0599999999995s)]
*  And when he comes back, he forms this thing called the Wampanoag [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7432.86s)]
*  Confederation, whatever, whatever, just in that little area. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7435.66s)]
*  There's all these different cultures with their own history, [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7438.3s)]
*  their own knowledge and everything. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7440.34s)]
*  That's one little part of Massachusetts. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7441.9s)]
*  Now think about the rest of the country and how [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7444.82s)]
*  vast and sprawling and intricate and how deep that history really goes. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7448.339999999999s)]
*  And you can just you could place the United States inside the Amazon. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7452.98s)]
*  That's how big the Amazon is. Yeah. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7456.5s)]
*  And we just refer to natives tribes who lived in the Amazon as Amazonians. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7458.179999999999s)]
*  But it's it's so much more complicated than just that. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7462.46s)]
*  Now, the next thing is this whole conversation about talking about the where Jaguar. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7466.099999999999s)]
*  You know, I get a lot of I get a lot of flack for this for this topic, because [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7470.18s)]
*  you know, you have let's just call it like Boomer archaeologists who [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7475.66s)]
*  have this knee jerk reaction to psychedelics and hallucinogens [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7479.860000000001s)]
*  because it's so ingrained in them that like all drugs are bad [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7482.66s)]
*  as if all drugs are the same. You know what I mean? Right. And [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7486.62s)]
*  I've been talking to this. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7490.06s)]
*  I was in Mexico last year and we were in the Yucatan [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7491.54s)]
*  and I was there with an archaeologist from the Midwest. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7495.9400000000005s)]
*  And he was an archaeoastronomer, which is like I was saying earlier. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7499.82s)]
*  It's a guy who studies the way that I think it's like Pueblo ancestral [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7503.66s)]
*  tribes would have interacted with the night sky and study the night sky. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7508.62s)]
*  And I was like, I asked him, I said, OK, so what kind of hallucinogens [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7511.7s)]
*  do you think they would have had? [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7514.7s)]
*  And I think he told me like peyote and cannabis and stuff like that. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7515.5s)]
*  And I was like, OK, so have you ever [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7518.38s)]
*  and, you know, we were like every night we get together and we'd all smoke [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7521.38s)]
*  and just talk about ancient history and stuff. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7525.219999999999s)]
*  You know, you come up with so many interesting ideas and perspectives [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7527.5s)]
*  and points of view, you know, when you smoke with like it, [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7530.46s)]
*  like an actual purpose and you're trying to, you know, think. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7532.38s)]
*  I'm sure you know very well what I'm talking about. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7535.54s)]
*  And I and so he's sitting around with all of us and he doesn't want, [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7537.54s)]
*  you know, he's not interested. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7541.62s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm like, so you were studying archaeoastronomy for this long. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7543.06s)]
*  Have you ever tried cannabis or peyote or anything that's up there? [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7547.26s)]
*  I think there's another one called Dittura. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7550.46s)]
*  Have you ever heard of this? [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7551.98s)]
*  That one's supposed to be very weird. Yeah. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7552.82s)]
*  I had terrible experiences with that. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7554.94s)]
*  Oh, really? Well, maybe it's completely disassociates you. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7557.54s)]
*  He was having a conversation with a guy in a market [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7560.74s)]
*  and he realized in the middle of the conversation, [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7562.94s)]
*  the guy thought that they were in his apartment. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7564.78s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Like it does weird. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7567.58s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it might explain why Teotihuacan civilization [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7570.18s)]
*  and all their iconography is so terrifying. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7574.06s)]
*  Like if you look up the great goddess of Teotihuacan, [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7575.86s)]
*  it's these guys with handbags picking, [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7579.02s)]
*  picking this Dittura and like putting them in their handbags. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7582.38s)]
*  Oh, boy. Yeah. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7584.98s)]
*  Oh, that's a weird one. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7586.22s)]
*  And so their whole their whole civilization is like very dark and scary. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7587.860000000001s)]
*  But I asked this archaeologist, I said, OK, have you ever gone out [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7592.34s)]
*  and studied the stars, you know, from the Native American point of view [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7595.42s)]
*  while you're smoking cannabis or you take peyote? [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7598.9800000000005s)]
*  And he's like, oh, no, I wouldn't do that. And I'm like. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7601.66s)]
*  You have committed your entire life to studying this ancient culture [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7605.46s)]
*  that you know very well was studying the stars and taking hallucinogens. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7608.860000000001s)]
*  And you as someone who's supposed to be an expert in this field, [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7612.9s)]
*  you don't want to put yourself in the shoes of these people. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7617.82s)]
*  I was like, I was like, dude, if you laid out at night [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7620.98s)]
*  with everything you know about the Pueblo ancestral people [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7623.219999999999s)]
*  and you smoked weed for the first time or you did peyote or something, [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7625.98s)]
*  you stayed up and looking at the stars, you might have an epiphany [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7630.339999999999s)]
*  about something that you've never realized because your brain's [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7632.98s)]
*  just operating in a different way than it normally does. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7635.219999999999s)]
*  And he was very slow to like, you know, to be open to this idea. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7637.78s)]
*  And, you know, the Zahi thing kind of reminded me of this is like, [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7643.06s)]
*  you know, he has preconceived ideas about his world and his personal beliefs [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7645.94s)]
*  that interact with the archaeology, you know. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7650.62s)]
*  And so it's really hard for us to study the ancient world [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7653.7s)]
*  from a completely unbiased point of view, because you have so many preconceived [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7658.26s)]
*  ideas about your modern world that influence your archaeology. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7661.54s)]
*  And that's why the widely, [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7665.139999999999s)]
*  that's why there's no widely accepted or it's not widely accepted among archaeologists [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7669.099999999999s)]
*  that Native Americans were heavily influenced by hallucinogens. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7673.9s)]
*  I really think it's because so many of these people are, you know, [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7677.98s)]
*  older archaeologists that have a knee-jerk reaction to drugs of any kind. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7681.62s)]
*  And they couldn't possibly fathom the reality that the culture [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7684.9s)]
*  they spent their life studying are all doing hallucinogens all the time. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7687.54s)]
*  And that's unquestionably unquestionably. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7691.139999999999s)]
*  It's totally obvious. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7693.339999999999s)]
*  It's completely obvious. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7694.58s)]
*  But yeah, it's also these people that haven't had these experiences, [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7696.1s)]
*  so they don't know what the effects would be. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7699.66s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So they're basically just guessing. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7701.62s)]
*  And a lot of is based on just say no propaganda from the fucking 80s. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7704.54s)]
*  It really is, man. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7708.1s)]
*  I was telling my I was telling my wife this, like I didn't. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7709.1s)]
*  You know, I don't smoke a lot. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7712.18s)]
*  When I do, I'm like out in Big Ben, you know, out looking at the stars and stuff. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7713.58s)]
*  And every time I smoke, it's like some kind of purpose. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7717.26s)]
*  Like, you know, I'm in like some kind of sacred place. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7720.0199999999995s)]
*  And I don't do anything harder than just smoke cannabis. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7722.74s)]
*  But whenever I do, I have some kind of realization about myself personally. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7725.34s)]
*  You know, like the first time [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7728.7s)]
*  I don't know, six or seven years ago, when I first smoked, [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7732.0199999999995s)]
*  I was laying up looking at the night sky and we had taken some photos out in the desert. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7734.099999999999s)]
*  And I was looking at myself and I put on a little bit of weight. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7737.46s)]
*  And as I was looking at myself, I had disassociated. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7739.86s)]
*  And I was like, this person does not represent the brain that's in my mind. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7741.94s)]
*  I need to lose some damn weight. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7745.7s)]
*  You know, I had this realization about myself. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7747.179999999999s)]
*  The last time I was out, I was out in Big Ben, laying under the stars in the middle of the desert. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7748.86s)]
*  And I had this like realization that, you know, all the time I spend traveling [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7754.94s)]
*  and I get to see so many amazing ancient sites and meet so many cool people. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7760.38s)]
*  And I'm just constantly go, go, go, go, go, go. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7765.7s)]
*  Like I'm trying to just make this life work. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7767.82s)]
*  And I had this realization that the most important thing I do is [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7770.099999999999s)]
*  is make dinner for my wife and take my dog on walks. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7775.0199999999995s)]
*  And I had I would have never had that like epiphany like, dude, all this stuff is really cool, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7777.86s)]
*  but it's for fun. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7783.099999999999s)]
*  And this is the stuff that you love. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7783.94s)]
*  Your purpose is to take your dog on walks and spend time with your wife. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7785.62s)]
*  And one day it's going to be to spend time with your kids. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7789.42s)]
*  And every time I go into it with this idea that I hope that I have some kind of realization, I always do. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7791.54s)]
*  And and it's just like I have this I know that ancient plant medicine is like the key to [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7797.38s)]
*  unlocking so much of the ancient world. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7804.299999999999s)]
*  And and so to ignore that knowing that they imbibed, to ignore that knowing that it was a part of these sacred rituals [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7806.46s)]
*  is kind of silly, especially when you deal with the Amazon and ayahuasca. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7816.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Right. Yeah. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7820.1s)]
*  I mean, if you're going to be in a place where you want to completely convene with nature, [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7821.38s)]
*  like that's the place like that. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7826.26s)]
*  That's the place. And if there's this [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7828.3s)]
*  insanely profound hallucinogen, you know, that the brain produces endogenously, [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7830.38s)]
*  that can be extracted from plants through this really weird method where you're taking one plant [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7838.06s)]
*  that has the drug in it, another plant, which is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7844.1s)]
*  and you're combining them together and the perfect amount and boiling it. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7849.02s)]
*  It tastes like shit. Like, why are you doing this? [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7854.14s)]
*  Like, how'd you want? And then when you ask them how they learned how to do this, [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7855.780000000001s)]
*  they're like, the plants taught us. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7859.18s)]
*  Yeah, I know. Right. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7861.18s)]
*  You know, and then you can take that you can take that same chemical [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7862.9400000000005s)]
*  and they'll pour it in the water and rather than fishing or, you know, spearing fish in the water [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7865.660000000001s)]
*  or hooking them, they pour it into the water in these little, you know, [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7869.900000000001s)]
*  they create these little canals off of the Amazon and fish, piranha, whatever will swim up in it. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7872.660000000001s)]
*  And they pour that they pour that that liquid, wherever that hallucinogen isn't, [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7877.700000000001s)]
*  and it stuns the fish and they all come to the top and they only take what they need [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7881.1s)]
*  and they send the rest back, which is another reason why I don't think that [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7884.14s)]
*  Native Americans are responsible for the extinction of all the megafauna in the Americas, [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7887.62s)]
*  because, you know, OK, so I'm so I'm out in the woods in East Texas a couple of weeks ago [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7891.34s)]
*  and we're just walking around and we're talking about the Caddo people. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7896.7s)]
*  Have you heard of the Caddo Indians before? [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7899.46s)]
*  And I was trying to talk to my friend who doesn't know a lot about Native Americans, [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7901.5s)]
*  trying to like tell him, trying to give him the essence of the people. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7905.900000000001s)]
*  And the words came to me and I was like, I was like, if nature itself [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7909.26s)]
*  took an anthropomorphic form, that's the Native American. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7914.06s)]
*  These are people that lived perfectly with their environment or tried to, [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7917.42s)]
*  at least most of them did. And, yeah, it's just it's just it's amazing, man. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7920.74s)]
*  So much can be learned from that. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7926.34s)]
*  They did some wasteful things. I know, I know. Yeah. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7927.38s)]
*  Buffalo jumps. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7929.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's that's true. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7932.14s)]
*  And I'm really speaking in generalities like like I could go on and on [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7933.78s)]
*  about all the horrific things that the Aztecs did. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7937.5s)]
*  This is just a general rule or the Comanche or the Comanche. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7940.3s)]
*  You know, it's not like this was a it's not at all. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7943.66s)]
*  Like this was a utopia at all. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7947.3s)]
*  It was complete and utter war. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7949.26s)]
*  But then again, you're saying embodiment of nature. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7951.18s)]
*  Well, nature is not utopia. Exactly. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7953.3s)]
*  Jaguar is not utopia for an antelope. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7955.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, very much so. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7957.900000000001s)]
*  So, you know, there's some nuance there. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7960.54s)]
*  And but yeah, I just. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7962.22s)]
*  I don't know. It's just fascinating. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7966.22s)]
*  You had a you had a good point in a podcast. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7967.9400000000005s)]
*  I think you were talking about Oriana, his expedition down the Amazon, [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7971.74s)]
*  and you were talking about how he was able to use the stars to navigate [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7976.34s)]
*  back to Spain. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7980.46s)]
*  And you were like, you're like, well, you know, that's what that's what [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7981.860000000001s)]
*  or not, but, you know, that's what people used to do. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7983.860000000001s)]
*  Everybody was an astronomer. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7985.900000000001s)]
*  How much of this experience has gone to us today? [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7987.38s)]
*  We don't sit around and look at the stars anymore. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7990.58s)]
*  And that's one aspect. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7992.62s)]
*  We don't we don't interact with, you know, natural plant based, [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7993.82s)]
*  you know, hallucinogens anymore. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7997.34s)]
*  There's so many things about the natural world that we don't interact with. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=7998.78s)]
*  Those two are huge. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8001.900000000001s)]
*  And particularly the one the first one, the stars, [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8002.900000000001s)]
*  because people don't even consider how much light pollution. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8006.0599999999995s)]
*  If you ask the average person with the night, an average person [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8008.78s)]
*  who lives in New York City or Boston or wherever, the night sky is polluted. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8011.98s)]
*  You just don't think it's polluted, but it's polluted by light. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8016.86s)]
*  And you're you're missing this incredible, [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8019.7s)]
*  majestic image of the cosmos that's so humbling that it puts you in check. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8023.78s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. It puts you in check. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8028.7s)]
*  It really does. Like anybody that has a diluted ego, that's going to go away [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8030.299999999999s)]
*  if you're confronted with the Milky Way. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8034.06s)]
*  Yeah, you have some delusions of grandeur in your place. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8035.780000000001s)]
*  And you're like, well, it's not possible. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8039.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, just look at this. It's like I am nothing. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8041.860000000001s)]
*  I am nothing. And I'm everything. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8044.660000000001s)]
*  I'm a part of everything, but I am nothing. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8046.14s)]
*  And so many of these people who still today exist in the [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8047.860000000001s)]
*  the natural world, like the wild, you know, Percy Fawcett [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8052.620000000001s)]
*  interacting with these Amazonian tribes that still live like this today. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8056.5s)]
*  These people are still around. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8059.26s)]
*  They're still like Paul Rosalie sent me a video a month ago. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8060.54s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah. Sure. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8063.58s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I'll show this video. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8065.26s)]
*  I can't share it with the world. So haha. Sorry. I'm a gatekeeper. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8066.58s)]
*  Like everybody's a gatekeeper, I guess. Yeah. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8072.34s)]
*  But Paul doesn't want people to know where these people are. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8075.02s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. Trying to hide this stuff. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8078.38s)]
*  But he took this video while he was out in the Amazon, [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8080.1s)]
*  like helping these people. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8086.58s)]
*  So this is like video from his phone. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8088.14s)]
*  God, where is it, Paul? [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8092.02s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8097.660000000001s)]
*  Joe, you can't share this with anybody. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8099.620000000001s)]
*  Can't share with anybody over share with you. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8102.34s)]
*  Just make sure the cameras are on it. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8105.14s)]
*  Wow. Man, that is crazy. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8109.9800000000005s)]
*  Wild. I mean, you're so those people looking. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8114.06s)]
*  You're looking into the past. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8118.18s)]
*  You're looking way into the past. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8119.46s)]
*  I mean, way in the past. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8121.62s)]
*  Just in your frame right there. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8123.06s)]
*  What you were looking at has existed since the beginning of time. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8124.74s)]
*  Yes. And that's what's interesting is that exists at the same time [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8127.82s)]
*  as you and I talking on a podcast where millions of people are going to hear it. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8132.1s)]
*  And it's all electronic recording of our voice and images [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8136.62s)]
*  and then distributed wirelessly into your phone instantaneously. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8140.82s)]
*  The moment this episode gets uploaded on Spotify, [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8146.34s)]
*  people will click it and watch it on their phone instantly. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8149.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Like all the same time where these people are living in a home. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8152.58s)]
*  They're in. They're in the same time zone. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8155.94s)]
*  Yeah. Same time zone. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8157.5s)]
*  Yeah. Whatever it is right now, it's the same time. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8159.139999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8161.099999999999s)]
*  And when our civilization, we all destroy ourselves and thousands of years go by [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8162.38s)]
*  and everything in the studio is gone, it all turns to dust. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8166.62s)]
*  Those people will continue the legacy of humanity. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8169.9s)]
*  Well, I wonder if those people are the preppers of the Amazonian world. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8172.9s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8178.06s)]
*  Like like if everything did go sideways because the Europeans came over [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8178.74s)]
*  and brought all the diseases and civilization collapse here, who's going to live? [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8182.14s)]
*  No, you're you are exactly right. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8185.9s)]
*  So when that country boy can survive, that's like the Hank Williams, Jr. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8188.9s)]
*  song in reality. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8192.78s)]
*  Dude, you are exactly correct. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8194.62s)]
*  I mean, you're exactly correct. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8196.5s)]
*  So when the Spaniards arrive, they obviously they land in the Bahamas [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8198.1s)]
*  with Columbus 1492, but they come down to like Hispaniola, Jamaica. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8202.82s)]
*  And in the early 1500s, they start poking around on the shores of the Yucatan. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8206.94s)]
*  And and they're kind of trading and interacting with these people. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8212.42s)]
*  You know, these are explorers. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8216.78s)]
*  They're all curious. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8217.820000000002s)]
*  But they didn't realize that they were giving these Native Americans disease. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8218.78s)]
*  And that disease was spreading through the Maya world. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8221.7s)]
*  And maybe more than a decade later, when Cortez arrives in the Maya world, [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8224.140000000001s)]
*  he documents how all the Maya people are very scrawny and small and sickly and weak. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8227.78s)]
*  He didn't realize they were all dying off. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8232.18s)]
*  So eventually, Cortez conquers Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, in 1521. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8234.54s)]
*  And he sends he sends Pizarro down to find the gold that the Aztecs [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8239.900000000001s)]
*  were getting from South America or from this distant land. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8245.220000000001s)]
*  They didn't 100 percent know exactly what South America was yet. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8247.900000000001s)]
*  He goes down to South America and he conquers the Inca Empire. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8251.300000000001s)]
*  And then after that, Oriana descends down the Amazon. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8255.94s)]
*  And when he descends down the Amazon, he sees these cities [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8259.7s)]
*  that would go on for 15 miles long. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8262.9s)]
*  I mean, these 15 mile long cities full of millions and millions of people, [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8265.98s)]
*  these giant circular stone buildings, these huge bustling civilizations. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8269.46s)]
*  And and then later on in the 1700s, 1800s, and then really densely in the early 1900s, [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8274.5s)]
*  like with Percy Fawcett, Theodore Roosevelt, everyone around them. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8280.9s)]
*  They were looking for these big cities that the Spaniards had seen, [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8284.619999999999s)]
*  but they didn't exist and they didn't find any evidence of it at all. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8287.619999999999s)]
*  And a lot of people like like the British and the Royal Geographic Society, [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8291.9s)]
*  they brush it off as, oh, the the Spaniards were lying [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8296.38s)]
*  so that they could secure funding for further expeditions. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8300.22s)]
*  And this was like their livelihood, the way that they could stay rich. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8302.46s)]
*  Of course, then the LIDAR proves that these civilizations were there. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8305.3s)]
*  Now, the stuff that's been excavated in the Amazon, [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8308.62s)]
*  we haven't excavated anything in the center of the Amazon. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8311.62s)]
*  It's it's really expensive. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8313.7s)]
*  It's hard to do. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8314.94s)]
*  Archaeologists don't want to live out there, whatever, whatever. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8315.82s)]
*  There's a million reasons why it doesn't happen. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8318.7s)]
*  But on the peripheral of the Amazon, [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8320.58s)]
*  there are areas that get cut flat for logging, like, you know, [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8323.3s)]
*  as civilization slowly encroaches on the Amazon, they are finding [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8326.62s)]
*  these villages that are these [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8331.22s)]
*  they're basically cities that are these huge geoglyphs that are cutting the ground. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8334.46s)]
*  Have you seen these in the Amazon? [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8337.22s)]
*  They're they're huge. I believe so. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8339.26s)]
*  Yeah, I believe this is some stuff that Graham was showing. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8341.14s)]
*  Maybe so. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8343.5s)]
*  See if you can trust me. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8344.74s)]
*  I think Graham has talked about this before. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8345.3s)]
*  Maybe it was in America before. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8346.98s)]
*  What should he look if he's looking for image? [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8348.46s)]
*  Just Amazon geoglyphs. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8350.38s)]
*  They'll come up. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8352.66s)]
*  There are these huge squares. Yeah, perfect. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8353.46s)]
*  So these things are. Yeah, we definitely talked about these things are gigantic. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8355.5s)]
*  And and they're all over the peripherals of the Amazon. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8358.58s)]
*  But the this was these were the preppers living on the outside. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8362.06s)]
*  They weren't living in the hustle and bustle of the, you know, [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8365.859999999999s)]
*  million plus population city in the middle of the Amazon. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8368.46s)]
*  These are the guys living on the outside. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8371.22s)]
*  And they all survived this apocalyptic disease that went through. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8372.539999999999s)]
*  They're the people living in Appalachia. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8376.38s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8378.619999999999s)]
*  Folks. Yeah. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8379.78s)]
*  Actually, I'm moving there tomorrow. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8381.74s)]
*  Are you really? Yeah. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8383.02s)]
*  I'm in the middle of moving right now. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8383.7s)]
*  Yeah. So cool place to live. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8385.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's beautiful up there, man. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8387.18s)]
*  Dude, it's it's an ancient place. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8388.94s)]
*  Have you heard of the Nantahala Rainforest? No. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8390.380000000001s)]
*  Oh, you got to go there tomorrow. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8392.94s)]
*  It's it's it's in Western North Carolina in Appalachia. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8394.74s)]
*  I grew up I grew up going to Nantahala every year. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8399.66s)]
*  My parents live in Nantahala now, [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8403.060000000001s)]
*  and it's a beautiful, completely magical place. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8405.54s)]
*  And it was it was part of what inspired this like [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8409.62s)]
*  explorer, you know, kind of thing in me. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8413.02s)]
*  When you're there, I even as a kid, I knew that this was an ancient place. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8416.26s)]
*  And turns out as an adult, when I start researching it, [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8419.7s)]
*  it's this pocket of green, I mean, solid, dark green rainforest. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8422.34s)]
*  In the U.S., we have three rainforests. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8426.94s)]
*  We have Hawaii, we have Oregon, and we have the Nantahala rainforest [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8428.300000000001s)]
*  that most people don't know about. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8431.58s)]
*  It's this pocket in the middle of these mountains [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8433.54s)]
*  that has looked exactly the same since before the ice age. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8436.300000000001s)]
*  It's one of the oldest places in North America. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8439.26s)]
*  And it's just it's just an incredibly magical, old, ancient place. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8442.02s)]
*  And I'm just like drawn back there. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8448.26s)]
*  But anyways, yeah, you should go you should go check that out. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8451.34s)]
*  That sounds incredible. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8453.18s)]
*  You're going to live out in that area in the Appalachians? [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8455.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, well, so my my wife is [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8458.62s)]
*  so she's like from South Carolina and she came to [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8462.22s)]
*  she came to Texas when she was younger. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8466.06s)]
*  And then we met in college. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8468.78s)]
*  And my my family, when we first moved to the states, [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8470.42s)]
*  like my family moved to North Carolina in like 1694 or something crazy like that. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8473.900000000001s)]
*  And and so we have some roots up there. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8478.34s)]
*  Have you ever been to Gatlinburg, Tennessee? No. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8480.66s)]
*  So the first name of Gatlinburg was Reagan Town. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8482.820000000002s)]
*  And so that was where my my my family were one of the founders of that town. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8485.94s)]
*  There's an old hotel there called Reagan Motel. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8490.02s)]
*  So my family's originally from there. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8491.74s)]
*  And then they moved down to Texas and started cattle rustling in the in the late 1890s. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8493.02s)]
*  But I don't know, just drawn back up there. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8497.34s)]
*  I always love vacationing there. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8500.300000000001s)]
*  And so my wife and I are like in the middle of moving right now. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8501.62s)]
*  And so two days ago, we packed up these two U-hauls, drove them to East Texas [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8504.74s)]
*  to my in-laws, and then we drove to Austin last night, got a hotel doing this. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8508.54s)]
*  Tonight, we drive back to East Texas and then tomorrow we drive to North Carolina. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8512.380000000001s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8515.58s)]
*  So what is the history in terms of human occupation in that area? [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8516.5s)]
*  Man, the people sprouted out of the ground. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8521.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's that old man. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8525.34s)]
*  There are that's something I'm really looking forward to getting into. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8527.3s)]
*  And I'm kind of excited in a way to get out of Texas, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8531.66s)]
*  because it's hard to study Native American history in Texas, [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8534.14s)]
*  because you got to travel so far and everything so arid like, you know, Austin. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8536.42s)]
*  This was this was an ancient Native American settlement here [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8539.86s)]
*  that we have built this city on top of. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8543.26s)]
*  The Alamo in San Antonio was built on top of a Native American settlement. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8545.539999999999s)]
*  And, you know, all of our major cities are just a reskin of an ancient city. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8550.34s)]
*  And in Texas, it's really hard. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8554.46s)]
*  Like we have the Galt site that's here in that's here in Austin [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8555.82s)]
*  that proves that Clovis first was wrong. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8559.46s)]
*  I mean, maybe you're familiar with this. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8561.58s)]
*  But up there, you're closer to mound country and, you know, [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8564.539999999999s)]
*  where all the mound builders are. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8567.98s)]
*  I'm a little bit north of that. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8569.179999999998s)]
*  But in North Carolina, it's one of the places that the Spaniards had a really hard [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8570.58s)]
*  time infiltrating because of the mountain ranges and because of how fierce [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8574.939999999999s)]
*  the Native Americans were. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8578.58s)]
*  And so the archaeological projects up there are headed up [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8580.019999999999s)]
*  by like two hillbillies that live in the country. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8583.06s)]
*  And they're the coolest guys. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8585.58s)]
*  They own this little department store called the called the Tiger Store [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8587.019999999999s)]
*  in Hayesville, North Carolina. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8590.1s)]
*  And and they have dug up like Spanish armor under the ground [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8592.34s)]
*  and Spanish swords and all kinds of crazy stuff. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8596.5s)]
*  And I've gone hiking out there. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8599.14s)]
*  And oh, we got we looked this up. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8601.3s)]
*  Jamie, can we please look up a juda cooler rock? [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8603.699999999999s)]
*  It's one of the only megaliths in North America. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8606.1s)]
*  And it's this gigantic megalithic stone that has the same sort of art style [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8608.34s)]
*  as all the Native American stuff that we've seen. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8614.140000000001s)]
*  And it's some kind of primordial map of Western North Carolina. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8616.42s)]
*  It's massive, dude. You couldn't fit it in this room. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8620.02s)]
*  It's called juda cooler. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8622.98s)]
*  If you just try to spell it in some way, you might find it. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8624.220000000001s)]
*  There you go. And there's an old photo of an archaeologist laying behind it. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8626.380000000001s)]
*  There you go. To the top left, that one or maybe the one that's colorized there. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8630.54s)]
*  That that one's really, really pretty. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8633.9s)]
*  So nobody knows what this is. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8636.38s)]
*  And the Native Americans who were asked [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8638.42s)]
*  some of the stories about the early Native Americans who were asked [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8642.22s)]
*  how this got here, who moved it there, their stories are that giants placed this [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8644.939999999999s)]
*  and that giants used to live in this land and that they created these stones. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8648.939999999999s)]
*  And I have gone around when I was a little bit younger. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8653.14s)]
*  I would go through the rainforest and like wandering up these hillsides. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8655.939999999999s)]
*  And you'd find these huge stones laying there with all of these images carved [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8659.099999999999s)]
*  into them. And of course, you know, there's no funding that's out there. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8664.14s)]
*  There's not even that there's not even a police department out there. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8667.74s)]
*  So it's it's it nothing. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8670.46s)]
*  No research is being done out there. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8673.66s)]
*  But it's a fascinating place, as old as time itself. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8676.3s)]
*  And all of these people are from like a chapter before contact period. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8679.18s)]
*  Whoa. Yeah, it's fascinating, man. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8685.14s)]
*  It's just a it's a very ancient, mysterious, mystical place. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8687.019999999999s)]
*  It's one of those places that kind of gives me the feeling that Peru gives me [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8691.619999999999s)]
*  when I'm out there, that I'm in a very, very, very old place. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8695.14s)]
*  And of course, you know, the Appalachian Mountains are the oldest mountain range [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8698.22s)]
*  in the world. Is there any theory as to the age of that? [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8701.22s)]
*  Well, I think when you go there, they attribute it to [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8705.38s)]
*  they attribute it to a culture that lived in the area between 100 AD and 1000 AD. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8708.82s)]
*  But, you know, that's just totally guesswork. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8714.539999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8717.5s)]
*  Judicula and the Cherokee Indians. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8719.18s)]
*  Yeah. Now, you know, the hard part about [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8721.26s)]
*  the hard part about studying some stuff with Native Americans in the US [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8725.22s)]
*  is that there's a lot of like, you know, modern Native Americans, [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8729.06s)]
*  they're very prideful about their culture and, you know, a little bit of mythology [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8733.82s)]
*  gets gets mixed in. Like when you go when I go visit the [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8738.1s)]
*  I forget what exactly it's called. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8741.74s)]
*  But there's a there's a Native American [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8744.58s)]
*  village that still exists in this area of the country. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8747.38s)]
*  And it's like operated. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8750.22s)]
*  And it's kind of a tour place where they take people through what the cities [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8751.26s)]
*  would have looked like or what the towns would have looked like [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8754.1s)]
*  in the middle of the rainforest. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8756.26s)]
*  But the hard part is when I talk to the representatives there, [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8757.86s)]
*  which are Native American, you know, Cherokee people, they'll tell me, [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8760.94s)]
*  oh, yeah, you know, the ancient people that were here, they used to be six foot five. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8764.1s)]
*  They were very tall people or whatever. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8767.619999999999s)]
*  And there's no evidence behind that at all. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8769.3s)]
*  And so it's hard to like, OK, we have Cherokee bodies. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8772.82s)]
*  So are these are these oral memories that are being passed down [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8776.3s)]
*  through time that come down to the Cherokee? [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8781.14s)]
*  And, you know, as a as like a, you know, a modern day American anthropologist, [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8783.18s)]
*  do I brush off what they say and just be like, well, you know, they're [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8788.539999999999s)]
*  they're they're carrying on these myths about their people. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8791.7s)]
*  They want to build it up. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8793.94s)]
*  Or are they really holding on to something that's true? [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8795.06s)]
*  Because, man, I would love to talk to Graham about this. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8797.18s)]
*  OK, so, you know, one of the biggest things that refutes, [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8800.9s)]
*  I know it sounds like I'm bouncing all over the place, but one of the biggest things [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8803.54s)]
*  that they tried to use to refute the Sphinx's age, you know, about the Sphinx [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8806.7s)]
*  that could date back to the time of Leo, but 10,500 years ago or 10,500 BC, [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8812.66s)]
*  10,500 BC, is they say, well, there's no evidence that you could carry down [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8818.38s)]
*  the knowledge of constellations that far. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8822.26s)]
*  You've heard this before, right? [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8824.38s)]
*  Like, how do we know that people in 10,500 BC even recognize [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8825.5s)]
*  the constellation of Leo and and how is that knowledge carried down? [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8829.3s)]
*  Dude, there is evidence of this. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8833.699999999999s)]
*  OK, the squared spiral. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8835.699999999999s)]
*  Have you seen this motif anywhere? [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8837.42s)]
*  It's we can we can look it up. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8839.099999999999s)]
*  Greek meander pattern. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8841.5s)]
*  But you'll also see it in you'll see it in the American Southwest. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8843.34s)]
*  You'll see it out in the Mississippian cultures. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8847.3s)]
*  You'll see it in Mexico. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8849.58s)]
*  You'll see it in South America, Peru. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8850.66s)]
*  You'll see it in Greece. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8852.619999999999s)]
*  You'll see it in Egypt, Rome. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8853.939999999999s)]
*  This. Yeah, this pattern. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8856.019999999999s)]
*  So, you know, a lot of times this [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8857.78s)]
*  they say that this is like, well, when people use the term swastika, [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8860.58s)]
*  the swastika is just two meandering patterns or squared spirals [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8864.78s)]
*  that are laid on top of each other. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8868.66s)]
*  That's that's what it is. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8870.42s)]
*  Yeah. So it's a squared spiral. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8872.14s)]
*  But when you take two of those and lay them on top of each other, [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8873.58s)]
*  it becomes a swastika. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8875.58s)]
*  And you and I recognize where these meanders connect [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8876.82s)]
*  because of a certain recent culture that perverted this symbol [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8880.22s)]
*  and turn it into something evil. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8883.94s)]
*  But this is an ancient symbol and it's found all over the world. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8885.94s)]
*  And it even dates back to Ukraine. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8890.18s)]
*  You may be able to find this. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8893.26s)]
*  There's an ivory bone handle in Ukraine from like eleven thousand years ago [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8894.74s)]
*  that has the squared spiral that that's on it. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8899.7s)]
*  So this is eleven thousand years old, found on every continent on the planet. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8902.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So it's even found in pottery. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8907.7s)]
*  You can see it in pottery in ancient China, ancient Japan. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8909.86s)]
*  It's in Cambodia. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8913.78s)]
*  It's all across the ancient world. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8915.140000000001s)]
*  And I was asking, [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8917.34s)]
*  oh, oh, I know one that we could look up. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8920.34s)]
*  Could you look at the Temple of Mitla in Mexico? [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8922.300000000001s)]
*  It's a temple of Mitla. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8924.98s)]
*  And if we look there, you'll see it all up and down. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8926.1s)]
*  Now, Temple of Mitla is a shamanic temple. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8928.34s)]
*  It's like they think it was like a like a Mecca site that people would go to. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8932.06s)]
*  It was built to last for all of eternity. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8935.380000000001s)]
*  And of all the megaliths in all of Mesoamerica or ancient Mexico and Central [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8937.7s)]
*  America, this site uses the largest stones. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8941.42s)]
*  So each one of these lentils that you see, these is like one solid piece [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8944.1s)]
*  of volcanic stone, very, very hard stones. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8947.66s)]
*  OK, so you can see the squared spiral, right? [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8950.98s)]
*  Can you see the step pattern that leads up to them? [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8953.66s)]
*  And you can probably find another photo [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8956.1s)]
*  where you see the step pattern leading up to the spiral. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8957.54s)]
*  So it's like it's like you're walking up steps into a spiral. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8960.140000000001s)]
*  And it's this loop that continues on forever. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8963.66s)]
*  I have a ton of these photos on my phone. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8965.86s)]
*  They're found all over Peru. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8967.74s)]
*  There we go. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8969.42s)]
*  Now, this is not quite exactly it. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8971.42s)]
*  But OK, so what this what this really is, this step pattern [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8975.02s)]
*  in this motif of the spiral here is it's the Big Dipper in the night sky. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8980.18s)]
*  You can go look at the Big Dipper and the Big Dipper changes [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8985.26s)]
*  over the course of the year. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8989.58s)]
*  So if you look at it as though it's not a Big Dipper [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8990.7s)]
*  and you look at it as though it's a staircase to a spiral, [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8993.460000000001s)]
*  that's exactly what ancient people are seeing the Big Dipper as. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=8996.66s)]
*  And the Big Dipper is spinning in the night sky throughout the year. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9000.42s)]
*  So this ancient symbol is them documenting a constellation [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9003.94s)]
*  from for over 11000 years. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9007.42s)]
*  Human beings have been documenting a constellation. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9009.98s)]
*  So if you're looking for the proof as to whether or not [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9012.18s)]
*  people 11000 years ago were recognizing a lion in the night sky. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9014.78s)]
*  Boom, there you go. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9019.62s)]
*  This is 11000 years old. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9020.98s)]
*  Yeah. OK, so look in here. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9023.02s)]
*  So it's a step up to a spiral, a step up to a spiral. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9024.42s)]
*  And dude, it's the Big Dipper. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9027.3s)]
*  Just look at the Big Dipper in the future as though it's this constellation. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9028.58s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9031.3s)]
*  Is this a theory that it's a Big Dipper? [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9032.02s)]
*  Has this been corroborated? [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9034.18s)]
*  This is my theory. Your theory. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9035.38s)]
*  This is my theory and like something I've been studying for a long time. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9036.74s)]
*  But there are other archaeologists who [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9040.46s)]
*  they're kind of have a passive interest in this. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9044.18s)]
*  And they have said, maybe it's the Big Dipper or something. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9046.74s)]
*  But these aren't these then people, if I were to go to them and be like, [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9048.94s)]
*  OK, well, you know, this ivory bone handle in Ukraine goes back 11000 years. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9051.74s)]
*  So it's proof they'd be like, OK, stop. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9056.06s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9057.740000000002s)]
*  So this is my theory that I have been studying for a long time. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9058.980000000001s)]
*  And everywhere I go in the Americas, I find that I find that spiral pattern [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9061.86s)]
*  everywhere and I always ask people, what does this mean? [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9065.94s)]
*  When I'm in the Mediterranean, I'll ask people, what does this mean? [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9069.1s)]
*  I'm going to go to I'm going to go to Greece at the end of the year. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9071.86s)]
*  And I'm going to ask because it's all over Greek temples, you know, [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9074.060000000001s)]
*  and and all I ever get from Greek archaeologists is that it's a river. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9077.02s)]
*  Bullshit. It's not a river. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9081.34s)]
*  And then in Latin America, I get a bit better of an explanation. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9082.900000000001s)]
*  And maybe this is maybe this is really it. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9086.58s)]
*  They think that it's like the they think that it's like the step, [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9089.82s)]
*  the steps through life in the in the rejuvenation of life. Right. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9093.22s)]
*  So it's like it's like the Big Dipper has some kind of esoteric meaning with it. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9097.66s)]
*  But I have been thinking about this. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9102.42s)]
*  And I think that this the reason that throughout all these ancient cultures, [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9105.02s)]
*  you see this meander pattern in so many different orientations [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9107.9s)]
*  as it's documenting, it's documenting the flipping of the Big Dipper [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9111.78s)]
*  through the night sky throughout the day. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9115.3s)]
*  And and that's that's all, you know, I'm trying to explain something. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9117.14s)]
*  It's 11000. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9120.58s)]
*  What is the earliest evidence of the understanding [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9121.3s)]
*  or the procession of the equinoxes? [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9125.66s)]
*  God, I don't know. I don't know. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9127.98s)]
*  That's that's getting like beyond my level of knowledge with archaeoastronomy. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9129.5s)]
*  Some people grant ramps theorize that. Yeah. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9135.939999999999s)]
*  Egyptians are aware of it. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9138.34s)]
*  I mean, I don't doubt that they're that they were aware of it. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9140.14s)]
*  Yeah. Bouval, I think, believe that. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9143.179999999998s)]
*  Or I know for sure, John Anthony West believed that. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9144.94s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I don't know, man. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9147.94s)]
*  I mean, the procession of the equinoxes, it takes at least what? [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9150.060000000001s)]
*  Twelve to twenty four. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9153.980000000001s)]
*  It's either 12 or it's twenty four thousand years to be able to. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9155.34s)]
*  Four thousand years. The full cycle. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9157.74s)]
*  If if we wanted to investigate an ancient culture, that's possible [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9160.26s)]
*  of being able to document this, it'd be worth looking into. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9166.060000000001s)]
*  If the Maya were aware. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9169.220000000001s)]
*  Let's explain to people what it means. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9170.980000000001s)]
*  So what it means is that the earth as it spins, it doesn't spin perfectly [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9172.86s)]
*  like there's a pin in the top and the pin in the bottom. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9177.5s)]
*  It spins like a globe. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9179.42s)]
*  It spins in a wobble and that wobbles a twenty four thousand year cycle. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9180.86s)]
*  The earliest understanding of the procession of the equinoxes, [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9185.42s)]
*  typically credited to Greek astronomer. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9187.5s)]
*  How do you say his name? Hipparchus? [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9190.34s)]
*  Yeah, Hipparchus. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9192.34s)]
*  Hipparchus in the second century B.C.E. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9193.06s)]
*  around 130 B.C.E. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9195.699999999999s)]
*  I bet you he did it in Alexandria, too. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9197.46s)]
*  Hmm. Hipparchus noticed the position of the equinoxes. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9199.14s)]
*  The points where the celestial equator intersects with the elliptic [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9202.22s)]
*  were shifting westward over time relative to the fixed stars. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9206.22s)]
*  He calculated this slow movement known as procession by comparing [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9209.5s)]
*  his own observations of star positions with earlier Babylonian and Greek records, [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9213.14s)]
*  particularly those of Tamarkus and Aris, [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9218.02s)]
*  still less restless from the third century B.C.E. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9221.539999999999s)]
*  Hipparchus estimated the rate of procession to be about one degree [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9225.18s)]
*  every 100 years, which is remarkably close to the modern value, [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9228.220000000001s)]
*  approximately one degree every 71.6 years. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9233.14s)]
*  There's no definitive evidence of earlier cultures fully understanding [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9237.06s)]
*  the procession as a systematic astronomical phenomenon. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9241.18s)]
*  But some scholars speculate the ancient civilizations like the Babylonians, [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9245.5s)]
*  Egyptians or Indians might have noticed relating patterns [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9248.98s)]
*  and star positions over long periods. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9252.66s)]
*  Yeah. Well, and then check this out. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9255.14s)]
*  Hipparchus discovery detailed in his lost work, but reference by Ptolemy, [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9256.54s)]
*  the pharaoh of the pharaoh over Alexandria in the Almagist, [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9260.5s)]
*  second century C.E. So this is happening in the city of Alexandria. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9265.66s)]
*  This all this is being studied in Alexandria's library marks [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9269.26s)]
*  the earliest confirmed understanding of procession in scientific sense. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9272.22s)]
*  Dude, that was lost in the burning of Alexandria's library. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9275.62s)]
*  Yeah. How crazy is that? [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9279.46s)]
*  It's all crazy. It's it's so fascinating because it's [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9281.58s)]
*  it makes sense that that would be something that everyone would be studying [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9286.5s)]
*  because it's the most spectacular thing you could ever see. Yeah. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9290.42s)]
*  Why would you just say, oh, it's just stars? [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9293.34s)]
*  Of course, you would. So silly. Of course. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9295.54s)]
*  You would. It's they're so majestic. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9298.06s)]
*  You would you would have to be transfixed. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9300.82s)]
*  You know, you know, something interesting that I was just reminded of is [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9303.86s)]
*  this meandering pattern. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9306.9s)]
*  It continues in the ancient Mediterranean world. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9308.9s)]
*  So Greece, Mesopotamia and Egypt, [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9312.3s)]
*  until Alexandria's library is burned and stops after that, you see it on the [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9315.380000000001s)]
*  you see it on the monument of Augustus, [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9321.62s)]
*  which is dates to about nine B.C. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9325.380000000001s)]
*  But that's for his death. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9328.22s)]
*  But Augustus would have seen Alexandria. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9329.06s)]
*  He would have been familiar with these motifs. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9330.78s)]
*  I believe after that in Rome, we don't see this motif anymore. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9332.380000000001s)]
*  The squared spiral in [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9335.7s)]
*  Mesoamerica, in Mexico and Central America. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9339.3s)]
*  This squared spiral motif stops [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9342.62s)]
*  with the burning of the Maya codices from Diego de Landa in like 1574. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9345.54s)]
*  He gathered all of the writing in the Maya world together [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9350.18s)]
*  in the city of what is modern day Merida. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9353.900000000001s)]
*  And he burned it all up. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9356.460000000001s)]
*  And it was it was called multiple pyres. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9357.900000000001s)]
*  So imagine, let's say a pyre is at least from the floor to the ceiling, [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9359.66s)]
*  stacked with codexes like like if you ever seen the sticky notes [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9362.62s)]
*  that are connected on the side, that's a that's how the Maya books looked. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9366.140000000001s)]
*  And he burned all the history. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9370.42s)]
*  Today, we only have three or four that exist. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9371.74s)]
*  And one of them is like controversial as to whether or not it's a forgery. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9374.26s)]
*  So he destroyed all of the written history of the Mesoamerican world [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9377.7s)]
*  and like one fell swoop. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9382.7s)]
*  And to give you an idea of just how much it was [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9384.220000000001s)]
*  when the Spaniards arrived in the Aztec world. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9387.62s)]
*  So the Aztec were standing on the standing on the shoulders of giants, [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9391.14s)]
*  being the Maya and all the other cultures. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9394.220000000001s)]
*  The Aztecs were producing. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9396.1s)]
*  250,000 pieces of paper a year, it's something like that. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9397.9s)]
*  It's it's an it's an incredible amount of written knowledge [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9402.34s)]
*  and all of that knowledge is burned and gone. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9406.02s)]
*  And so and so, you know, it just just again, when archaeologists [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9408.3s)]
*  stand behind their opinion so strongly as to chastise other people [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9413.46s)]
*  for speculating about, oh, well, you know, this could be this. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9417.06s)]
*  It's it's so silly because we're we're disconnected from the ancient world [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9419.26s)]
*  by a considerable margin. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9423.38s)]
*  I mean, none of us really understand what's going on. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9425.140000000001s)]
*  I was having a conversation with Dr. Barnhart. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9427.7s)]
*  We were at the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico, [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9430.5s)]
*  and we're looking at all these Maya gods up on this mural and everything [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9433.7s)]
*  in Mesoamerica, whether it's the Maya, the Olmecs, the Aztecs, [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9437.300000000001s)]
*  Teotihuacanos, Zapotecs, whatever. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9440.54s)]
*  It's all very fierce and dark and scary, kind of scary to us. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9442.18s)]
*  And we're looking up at it. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9447.66s)]
*  He's like, you know, I've always wondered, like, where's the love in their religion? [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9448.66s)]
*  Where's the love in their religion? [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9452.02s)]
*  Like, you know, where where are all the doves that you see, [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9453.74s)]
*  like in Christian churches and stuff? [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9456.619999999999s)]
*  And he was like, but, you know, in reality, if we could speak to them, [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9457.98s)]
*  we would probably be so embarrassed and shocked at how wrong our ideas [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9461.74s)]
*  are about who these people were. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9466.22s)]
*  And, you know, his his attitude and his approach to the ancient world, [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9468.14s)]
*  I just love it because, you know, [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9471.82s)]
*  he just presents like the evidence that's available, gives his idea [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9474.82s)]
*  of what he thinks the evidence means, while also saying, you know, [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9477.9s)]
*  this is just this is just my idea from this. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9480.66s)]
*  We could be completely wrong. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9483.02s)]
*  And we probably are completely wrong. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9484.42s)]
*  You know, think about like if you died and five thousand years from now, [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9486.02s)]
*  people started going through your belongings. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9490.94s)]
*  What would they think of you? [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9492.58s)]
*  It probably wouldn't be a very good representation of you. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9493.66s)]
*  You know, it depends on who's writing the story, right? [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9495.74s)]
*  If CNN wrote it, it'd be terrible. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9497.18s)]
*  You know, it'd be pretty bad. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9500.06s)]
*  It's really dependent upon who, again, is the gatekeeper of information. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9500.98s)]
*  Yeah. If you had a time machine and you go and observe undiscovered, [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9505.22s)]
*  any point in history, like you could put put you in some time bubble [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9510.62s)]
*  where you could just like be in this invisible bubble, [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9515.22s)]
*  where you could view it, where you're not interacting. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9519.14s)]
*  You're not you just watch. Yeah. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9521.98s)]
*  What time period and where? Oh, God. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9523.82s)]
*  I'm not going to say Egypt. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9530.74s)]
*  I feel like Egypt is such a like everyone says Egypt. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9532.02s)]
*  I would say Egypt. I know. I know. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9534.34s)]
*  If I if I if Egypt wasn't an option. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9537.34s)]
*  But why would you want that to not be an option? [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9539.94s)]
*  If I gave you a legit choice, if it was a real thing, [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9541.94s)]
*  if there was real technology, if they had developed some sort of a time warp [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9545.9s)]
*  technology that allowed you to in this controlled sphere [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9549.78s)]
*  exist for a particular amount of time, that you have three days in this area. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9553.7s)]
*  You bring food and water and you just know it can hurt me. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9558.74s)]
*  No one can stop you. No one can see you. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9561.9s)]
*  You exist in a time warp inside that, but you can observe all of it. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9564.220000000001s)]
*  It's got to be Egypt. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9567.9s)]
*  Well, yeah, yeah. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9569.1s)]
*  You have to figure out what time, because if you got there [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9571.140000000001s)]
*  and they had already built it, you like, shit. God damn it. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9573.18s)]
*  Yeah. Like maybe like you say, let me go 10,000 BC [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9575.74s)]
*  and you go there and it's already there. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9579.02s)]
*  Like, fuck, fuck. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9580.5s)]
*  You go back 20,000 BC. Yeah. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9582.460000000001s)]
*  You can only do it once like fuck. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9583.98s)]
*  But if you go back 30,000 BC, maybe there's nothing like. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9585.82s)]
*  Man. Egypt is a creme de la creme, man. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9590.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's the it's the most monumental, beautiful like, you know, [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9593.66s)]
*  when you try to imagine what it would have looked like, you know, [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9597.98s)]
*  if you've seen visual recreations of the Giza Plateau, you know, [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9600.5s)]
*  the the Valley Temple must have been absolutely stunning. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9604.74s)]
*  OK, so one day when you go to Egypt, hopefully you go this year, [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9607.779999999999s)]
*  when you go to the Valley Temple, that's the that for me, [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9613.3s)]
*  it's the best thing in all of Egypt. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9616.3s)]
*  I think it's I think it's more stunning what it must have looked like [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9618.74s)]
*  than even the pyramids themselves. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9622.1s)]
*  The blocks are absolutely gigantic, like one block is bigger than this whole wall. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9624.1s)]
*  And brought from 500 miles south in Aswan, [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9627.820000000002s)]
*  these are the ones with the cyclopean, strangely angled stones like you see in Peru. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9632.060000000001s)]
*  And when you walk in, most people ignore it. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9636.02s)]
*  But that floor is a is a calcite white crystal floor. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9639.26s)]
*  And so imagine when it was polished and when it was finished off, [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9644.220000000001s)]
*  it must have been gleaming. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9647.18s)]
*  And at some point in time, there were these diorite [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9648.62s)]
*  Khafre statues. Maybe you've seen them before. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9652.86s)]
*  They're like impossibly well made out of the hardest stone in Egypt, [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9655.02s)]
*  the hardest stone in Egypt. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9658.939999999999s)]
*  And it's this is black, diorite gleaming, polished statues. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9661.98s)]
*  And the lentils that go above would have allowed when the sun, you know, [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9665.82s)]
*  reaches its like zenith in the sky in the day, in the middle of the day, [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9669.82s)]
*  it would have shot through these holes in the ceiling. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9673.18s)]
*  And so it would have illuminated the white floor [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9674.98s)]
*  and you would have had the solid black [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9676.779999999999s)]
*  statues that are that are shining in the sun's light. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9678.9s)]
*  And so you're walking in and it's like glowing inside of the temple. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9681.98s)]
*  And and when you walk outside the front door of the temple, [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9685.26s)]
*  there's a dock and you can see the dock like slopes into the ground. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9688.619999999999s)]
*  So the water isn't there anymore. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9692.1s)]
*  The Nile is much further to the east now. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9693.74s)]
*  But it would have. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9696.14s)]
*  But the Nile came straight up to the front step of the of the Valley Temple. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9697.3s)]
*  So you so imagine you're like you're going, you know, [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9702.74s)]
*  you have someone pushing your little boat along on a pike in, [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9705.3s)]
*  you know, in Egypt and you're, you know, you're taking in like [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9708.3s)]
*  you know, you're taking in the nature around you and and like the seabirds [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9712.06s)]
*  that are flying over you and the palm trees that are everywhere. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9715.94s)]
*  And like imagine the sound of the waters. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9718.46s)]
*  You're coming up to the temple and it's this huge temple. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9720.38s)]
*  It's the it's the largest building on the planet at the time, you know, [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9722.98s)]
*  probably other than the pyramids themselves. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9728.58s)]
*  But and then you step into it and it's it is the most sacred, [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9732.539999999999s)]
*  most impressive thing that exists on the earth at that time. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9736.619999999999s)]
*  No matter if it was made in 2500 B.C. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9741.019999999999s)]
*  or if it was made in 10000 B.C., it's the most impressive building [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9743.5s)]
*  that exists in the world at that time. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9747.099999999999s)]
*  And what exactly was going on in these buildings? [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9749.179999999998s)]
*  I don't know. This is this is kind of another, [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9751.179999999998s)]
*  you know, hot take of mine is, man, I don't believe that, you know, [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9753.939999999999s)]
*  when you see all these pantheons of these gods in the ancient world, [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9757.939999999999s)]
*  I do not believe that ancient people are making all this shit up [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9761.3s)]
*  and building all these temples for these gods that never existed [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9764.38s)]
*  just to control the masses, whatever. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9767.699999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's an extensive amount of work all across the entire world. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9769.26s)]
*  You know, the Maya are building temples for these gods, [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9773.34s)]
*  these beings that they're that they're meeting the temple of Luxor [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9776.380000000001s)]
*  that you'll that you'll go to see. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9779.94s)]
*  You know, the story goes that Amenhotep built this last chamber, [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9781.5s)]
*  which is made out of these huge on top of the third, builds his last chamber. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9785.66s)]
*  Huge megalithic granite blocks to meet the god Amun Ra. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9789.42s)]
*  And I'm standing there inside the chamber looking around. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9794.460000000001s)]
*  He's the only person supposedly that's allowed in. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9797.300000000001s)]
*  That's a story that we know how true that is. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9799.26s)]
*  I don't know. But, you know, and I'm just thinking, man, [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9801.18s)]
*  either is it more likely that all this is made up [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9805.06s)]
*  or is it more likely that they went to the extent to do all this [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9807.9s)]
*  because it was all real and they're really interacting with these beings. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9810.460000000001s)]
*  And the most the most realistic way I can think of is by [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9813.78s)]
*  is by being involved in like shamanic practices and hallucinogens and like, [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9818.86s)]
*  you know, interacting with things that do not exist in our 3D plane. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9823.220000000001s)]
*  And and that adds to the allure of like when I'm standing in the Valley Temple, [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9828.02s)]
*  I'm like, what the hell is actually going on in here at this time? [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9832.06s)]
*  So after going through all that, I had to say Egypt. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9837.18s)]
*  No, you have to. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9839.3s)]
*  Now, my second one would be like, if I could be like, OK, [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9841.7s)]
*  take me to the height of Amazonian culture, just let me see just how amazing it is, [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9846.18s)]
*  because, you know, it really seems like stone architecture comes out of the Amazon. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9851.3s)]
*  Now, where Paul lives, it's all clay on the ground. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9856.38s)]
*  But when you get halfway through the Amazon, you start reaching like granite [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9859.14s)]
*  and limestone bedrock, and that's on the eastern side. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9862.06s)]
*  So you're in like Guyana, French Guyana, Brazil. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9864.82s)]
*  And it's treacherous places to go through in the middle of the Amazon. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9868.779999999999s)]
*  But I think that that's where cities in the Amazon are going to be found one day. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9872.5s)]
*  And it was towards the end of Oriana's expedition. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9876.58s)]
*  So that's about where he would have been. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9878.9s)]
*  And, man, I bet you there's stuff out there that would just amaze us. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9881.339999999998s)]
*  I think it I think the Amazon is the origin. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9885.22s)]
*  Just me personally, I think the Amazon is the origin of American, [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9888.14s)]
*  you know, pre-Columbian American, the height of their civilization. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9893.5s)]
*  I think it's the origin of their religion and shamanic practices. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9897.42s)]
*  I think it's spread out all the way up to Mexico. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9900.82s)]
*  And, you know, later on, the ancient Americans have a corn god, [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9903.939999999999s)]
*  which they call the Maze God. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9907.42s)]
*  But I think before that, they had this where Jaguar religion, [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9908.779999999999s)]
*  where people are taking hallucinogens and psychedelics. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9912.82s)]
*  And so I think that all the evidence points towards that [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9915.78s)]
*  the origin of civilization in the Americas begins in the Amazon and spreads out from there. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9919.46s)]
*  And I would love if a time machine could pull back that canopy [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9924.02s)]
*  and show me what the actual height of that was like. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9927.58s)]
*  It's just so interesting. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9931.02s)]
*  It never stops being interesting. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9932.58s)]
*  And it's one of those things. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9933.98s)]
*  It's a mystery that will never truly be totally solved [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9934.86s)]
*  because it's not possible to go back in time. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9937.34s)]
*  So we're always going to have this thing in our mind like, I wonder. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9939.779999999999s)]
*  And it's such a fascinating inclination to sit and just wonder about the past. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9944.099999999999s)]
*  And to look where we are now and how ridiculous life today is. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9949.779999999999s)]
*  This was undeniable. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9954.019999999999s)]
*  Humans are fools, particularly today. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9955.06s)]
*  For sure. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9957.82s)]
*  And I think one of the reasons why we're fools is we're denied these experiences [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9958.3s)]
*  that these people probably had. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9961.34s)]
*  We've outlawed them. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9963.06s)]
*  Yeah, just like they did in ancient Greece, just like they did, I'm sure, [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9964.14s)]
*  throughout history and all these different cultures. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9968.54s)]
*  You know, have you ever heard the have you ever heard the natives in Papua [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9971.26s)]
*  New Guinea and the songs that they sing that like emanate through the jungle? [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9976.1s)]
*  Have you ever heard this before? [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9980.140000000001s)]
*  When I when I study, I don't study. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9981.580000000002s)]
*  I only study native people in the Americas. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9984.42s)]
*  I got my hands full with that. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9986.7s)]
*  I can't really start studying. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9987.78s)]
*  You know, like, you know, I'm fascinated by the people who live on Sentinel Island. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9988.980000000001s)]
*  And akin to that are the people, the semi contacted people of Papua New Guinea. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9993.140000000001s)]
*  And when you listen to the songs that they sing, it reminds me so much [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=9998.06s)]
*  of what I heard yesterday and what I've known. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10001.099999999999s)]
*  But when Percy Fawcett says he hears the songs they sing, it reminds him of like, [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10003.019999999999s)]
*  oh, this is this is this is an advanced culture. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10006.98s)]
*  This is something that's being handed down through time. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10010.14s)]
*  It's beautiful. It's timeless. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10012.099999999999s)]
*  And when you hear the sound of the Papua New Guinea people singing [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10013.82s)]
*  and the way they harmonize with each other. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10018.259999999998s)]
*  These people are so connected to the earth that it's the earth [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10021.22s)]
*  singing to you through them. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10024.98s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10026.580000000002s)]
*  Can we hear that? Yeah. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10027.5s)]
*  This may not be what I'm talking about. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10032.34s)]
*  It's beautiful, though. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10042.86s)]
*  There's one of there's one of a man, he's right next to the camera. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10043.900000000001s)]
*  He's singing and you have all these people around him. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10047.34s)]
*  And it's just like stunningly beautiful. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10049.18s)]
*  Here it is. Here it is. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10052.060000000001s)]
*  papers [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10056.740000000002s)]
*  Val. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10085.62s)]
*  It's got some extra love on it. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10086.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10087.98s)]
*  I think it's just on loop. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10092.82s)]
*  10 hours. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10094.18s)]
*  It's a 10-hour video. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10095.26s)]
*  Hearing that makes me emotional hearing it. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10096.66s)]
*  Because it's beautiful. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10098.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10100.66s)]
*  Oh my god, it's gorgeous. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10101.16s)]
*  And you look in his eyes, and he has very innocent eyes. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10102.46s)]
*  It's the human embodiment of the planet itself, [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10107.74s)]
*  is that guy that you're looking at and what you're hearing. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10113.98s)]
*  And what's really fascinated by human cultures [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10116.18s)]
*  is the most satisfied, least anxious people [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10118.539999999999s)]
*  are subsistence livers. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10121.859999999999s)]
*  People that live off the land. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10124.14s)]
*  It's so true. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10125.46s)]
*  Have you ever seen the Vice piece about this guy [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10126.619999999999s)]
*  named Heinmo, Heinmo's Arctic Adventure? [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10131.42s)]
*  There's a great video piece from Vice from back in the day, [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10134.82s)]
*  a Vice guy to travel, where this journalist goes and lives [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10140.5s)]
*  with this guy who lives in the Arctic. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10144.019999999999s)]
*  And he's one of the last people that's [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10146.619999999999s)]
*  allowed to live off the land. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10148.5s)]
*  And he's a very intelligent guy who [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10150.22s)]
*  explains through the course of this, [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10153.46s)]
*  this is how people are supposed to be living. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10155.539999999999s)]
*  And he's essentially just hunting caribou and fishing. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10157.779999999999s)]
*  And he lives in peace and harmony. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10160.779999999999s)]
*  And he never wants to live in the city. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10163.5s)]
*  This is a natural way for us. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10165.3s)]
*  Does he have a little daughter with him or a little girl? [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10167.5s)]
*  He cuts up the fish, and he hands it to her, [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10169.900000000001s)]
*  and they give each other an Eskimo kiss. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10171.5s)]
*  Have you seen? [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10173.26s)]
*  I think it's maybe. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10173.900000000001s)]
*  I don't believe it's that. [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10174.66s)]
*  His daughter is full grown at the time. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10175.7s)]
*  But I'm sure there's many people living like this. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10178.460000000001s)]
*  But the point is that I think that if you [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10181.1s)]
*  look at modern society, we're so anxious and weird and depressed [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10183.900000000001s)]
*  and all these things wrong with us. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10188.1s)]
*  I think a lot of that is because, A, we're [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10189.7s)]
*  disconnected from nature, especially [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10193.7s)]
*  if you're living in a city. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10195.82s)]
*  I mean, there's no more insulation from nature [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10197.02s)]
*  than a skyscraper. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10199.22s)]
*  I mean, you're completely removed from it. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10200.5s)]
*  You've covered the ground in concrete. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10202.179999999998s)]
*  You're not interacting with nature at all. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10204.06s)]
*  That's why everybody goes to Central Park. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10206.06s)]
*  They're like, a little piece. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10207.58s)]
*  So give me a little bit of nature, right? [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10208.82s)]
*  So you're disconnected from nature, [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10210.859999999999s)]
*  which I think is a vitamin, I genuinely believe. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10212.38s)]
*  It's just like the sun gives you vitamin D. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10215.019999999999s)]
*  I think nature gives you some unmeasured vitamin [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10218.38s)]
*  that we just haven't figured out yet. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10221.82s)]
*  And then we're removed from these ancient experiences [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10223.5s)]
*  that connected people to the spiritual world. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10226.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10228.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's so true. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10230.980000000001s)]
*  I've been having these conversations with my wife [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10232.42s)]
*  recently. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10236.900000000001s)]
*  All of our friends are sort of, we're all kind of newlyweds. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10238.26s)]
*  My wife and I are about to approach our two-year. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10241.460000000001s)]
*  And our relationship is interesting [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10243.5s)]
*  because it kind of mimics ancient people, where [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10246.18s)]
*  a man has got to, in ancient times, [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10250.78s)]
*  the man would go off at a certain point periodically. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10253.380000000001s)]
*  He and all the other men of the village, [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10257.46s)]
*  or the younger men, would go off until they killed [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10259.859999999999s)]
*  a big animal, and they'd drag it back. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10262.539999999999s)]
*  And they'd be rewarded by the gratification of the women [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10264.5s)]
*  that are there. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10266.9s)]
*  And then they would play their part [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10267.5s)]
*  in helping to feed everybody. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10268.859999999999s)]
*  And you have this, the woman admires the man. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10270.099999999999s)]
*  The man's helping take care of her. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10273.9s)]
*  And then the men also get their time away [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10276.099999999999s)]
*  to be manly and be masculine and brave. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10278.06s)]
*  And now we exist in this world where, before I [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10280.419999999998s)]
*  was able to quit my job and pursue this full time, [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10284.42s)]
*  I was doing marketing just to make ends meet. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10287.58s)]
*  And I'm existing in this digital world that doesn't even exist. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10291.98s)]
*  I produce ads for companies that don't even [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10295.460000000001s)]
*  have a physical brick and mortar store. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10298.18s)]
*  It's all completely made up. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10300.14s)]
*  And I come home. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10302.34s)]
*  I would come home every single day. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10303.54s)]
*  And I had no male role in my little family. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10305.34s)]
*  My wife is in the middle of dental school. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10310.3s)]
*  And so we're both going off and coming back and doing [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10313.660000000002s)]
*  the same thing every day. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10315.380000000001s)]
*  And it's like this unnatural cycle. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10316.42s)]
*  And you wonder why people are so unhappy. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10318.5s)]
*  And now that I've been traveling quite a lot, [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10320.740000000002s)]
*  I go off. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10324.86s)]
*  I go off. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10326.62s)]
*  I travel. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10327.1s)]
*  I'm able to help provide for us. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10327.740000000002s)]
*  I'm gone. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10329.980000000001s)]
*  I come back. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10330.5s)]
*  And our relationship is strong. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10331.140000000001s)]
*  And it's intimate and romantic. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10332.54s)]
*  And she admires that aspect about me. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10334.060000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, this is kind of how this is a healthy thing [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10337.140000000001s)]
*  for our relationship. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10343.02s)]
*  And it's just reminded me more and more [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10344.34s)]
*  of how this modern world is so dystopian and so sick [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10345.98s)]
*  and poisonous to our minds. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10349.78s)]
*  We're operating in a made up realm. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10351.7s)]
*  It's just so much of what we do is completely [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10354.5s)]
*  made up and unnatural. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10356.300000000001s)]
*  We should be living by a fresh body of water. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10358.34s)]
*  And you and I should be running off into the forest [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10360.9s)]
*  and killing something with our hands or with a bow [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10363.1s)]
*  and dragging it back. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10365.62s)]
*  And all the women are, yay. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10366.5s)]
*  That's what life should be like. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10369.1s)]
*  But it's unfortunately science fiction. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10370.82s)]
*  I think you can live in this world and dabble in that world. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10374.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10378.74s)]
*  That's what I do. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10379.46s)]
*  For sure. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10380.1s)]
*  Yeah, well, I've seen that. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10380.619999999999s)]
*  I mean, you go off on your hunting expeditions. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10381.74s)]
*  Those are like, to me, spiritual journeys. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10384.02s)]
*  It is. [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10386.539999999999s)]
*  It sounds ridiculous. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10387.06s)]
*  Totally. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10387.74s)]
*  When I'm in the woods, like the real woods, [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10388.42s)]
*  when you're in the mountains in particular, [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10390.38s)]
*  because it's so unforgiving, it's so majestic, [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10392.1s)]
*  every part of me just goes, whew, like, wow. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10395.539999999999s)]
*  Here we are. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10399.699999999999s)]
*  Where are you at when you do that? [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10400.26s)]
*  Well, I really love Utah. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10401.7s)]
*  I really love the Wasatch Mountains. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10403.22s)]
*  I love that area. [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10406.02s)]
*  I'm scared of the Northwest. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10407.14s)]
*  My wife wants to take me to Montana and go hiking. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10409.42s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not going hiking out in the Northwest. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10412.5s)]
*  I don't belong out there. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10415.18s)]
*  There's grizzly bears. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10416.1s)]
*  I mean, those things, there's nothing you can do, man. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10416.82s)]
*  Nothing you can do. [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10418.86s)]
*  I'm OK on the East Coast, which is just black bears. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10419.86s)]
*  They're like rabbits. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10422.380000000001s)]
*  But dude, a grizzly bear? [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10423.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10425.9s)]
*  Have you seen the video of the guy who's [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10426.380000000001s)]
*  up on top of this granite facing? [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10427.960000000001s)]
*  He's filming, and he goes, there's [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10429.7s)]
*  a young grizzly bear down at the river below me. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10431.22s)]
*  And he's up on this granite face. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10433.38s)]
*  And he was like, I'm going to scare him off. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10434.98s)]
*  And he goes, hey bear, hey bear. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10436.94s)]
*  And the bear goes and charges directly to him [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10438.34s)]
*  and knocks down all the little trees. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10441.06s)]
*  And it comes up to the granite face, and it can't reach him. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10442.78s)]
*  But I'm like, dude, I would never want to go up there. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10445.32s)]
*  Your food. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10450.06s)]
*  Your food, man. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10451.26s)]
*  You're a part of the chain and not the good part. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10452.14s)]
*  No. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10454.34s)]
*  You're not the hunter with the deer. [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10455.14s)]
*  No. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10456.74s)]
*  There's an 800 pound super predator [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10457.24s)]
*  that can run 40 miles an hour. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10460.119999999999s)]
*  And he's headed right towards you. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10462.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10463.36s)]
*  And if you're a good shot with a high powered gun, [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10463.84s)]
*  you might be able to kill it. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10465.8s)]
*  But you'll be mauled to death by the time [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10466.76s)]
*  it wanders off into the forest and dies. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10468.96s)]
*  You might be able to kill it. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10470.8s)]
*  I mean, you need a large caliber rifle [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10472.119999999999s)]
*  and shoot it in the head. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10475.68s)]
*  And a pistol, that's the other thing. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10477.96s)]
*  If you have a 9 millimeter pistol, [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10479.68s)]
*  and you shoot a grizzly bear in the head, [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10481.36s)]
*  it's very likely it's going to bounce off of a skull, which [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10483.24s)]
*  is so scary. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10485.82s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10487.08s)]
*  Could you imagine people trying to navigate into or migrate [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10490.039999999999s)]
*  into the Americas, and they have to deal with the short face [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10493.28s)]
*  bear and polar bears? [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10495.52s)]
*  Right. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10497.039999999999s)]
*  The short face bear, which makes a grizzly bear [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10497.52s)]
*  look like a poodle. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10499.32s)]
*  It's utterly insane, man. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10501.12s)]
*  People lived in a gnarly place in the US. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10502.92s)]
*  Like we had American lions that are twice. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10505.8s)]
*  Bigger than the African lions. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10508.44s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10509.6s)]
*  We had elephants. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10510.56s)]
*  We had woolly mammoths. [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10511.78s)]
*  We had camels here. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10513.2s)]
*  We had gigantic horses. [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10514.28s)]
*  We had huge dire wolves. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10516.36s)]
*  We had these giant sloths. [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10518.12s)]
*  Oh, there's giant sloth caves in Nantahala. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10520.52s)]
*  And you can see them, and they're carved out. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10523.640000000001s)]
*  And it's cool, because there's multiple layers of history [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10525.76s)]
*  there. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10528.18s)]
*  So you have this mega fauna, Ice Age history [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10528.68s)]
*  of these huge giant sloth caves carved out [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10531.36s)]
*  in these prehistoric mountain sides. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10533.92s)]
*  But the Cherokee used those caves [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10537.28s)]
*  to hide in to escape the Trail of Tears. [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10539.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's fascinating stuff up there, man. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10543.400000000001s)]
*  So you have levels of history just in that one area [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10545.2s)]
*  of the country. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10548.12s)]
*  If you go out there, you'll feel like you're [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10548.880000000001s)]
*  in a primordial place that's kind of spiritual. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10550.720000000001s)]
*  I'm down. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10554.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10555.04s)]
*  I'll check it out. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10555.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you definitely have to. [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10556.04s)]
*  Listen, thank you so much for being here. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10557.68s)]
*  I really, really enjoyed this conversation. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10559.400000000001s)]
*  And I think we could do a bunch more. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10561.240000000002s)]
*  So let's do it again sometime. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10562.84s)]
*  I feel like I could have talked to you for 10 more hours. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10563.800000000001s)]
*  I feel like we could, too. [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10565.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10566.640000000001s)]
*  So tell everybody if they want to get into more of your work. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10567.400000000001s)]
*  Where should they go? [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10570.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so everything I do is just under my name, [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10571.92s)]
*  Luke Caverns. [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10574.64s)]
*  Caverns was just a name that my wife and I came up [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10575.88s)]
*  with to use a nomer because of privacy. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10579.24s)]
*  But my real last name is Reagan. [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10582.0s)]
*  And like I shared, I have this family history [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10584.199999999999s)]
*  and loosely connected to the presidential family. [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10586.96s)]
*  That's a different branch of our family from Tennessee. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10589.359999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10592.439999999999s)]
*  And so I kind of want to do it for privacy, [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10593.199999999999s)]
*  but that's impossible. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10596.08s)]
*  So I've just run with it. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10597.48s)]
*  But yeah, Luke Caverns, you can find everything [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10600.16s)]
*  I do under that. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10602.52s)]
*  And for a long time, I thought maybe I'd specialize [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10603.28s)]
*  in one area. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10607.560000000001s)]
*  But man, I'm interested in the ancient history [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10608.16s)]
*  of the entire world. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10612.52s)]
*  And I'm just always going to embrace that and explore [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10613.6s)]
*  the ancient world on foot. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10617.68s)]
*  And yeah. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10619.28s)]
*  I'm glad you're out there, man. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10620.84s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10622.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I love to be here. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10622.800000000001s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10623.480000000001s)]
*  It was really fun. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10624.0s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10624.720000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10625.2s)]
*  All right, bye, everybody. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28yl1TZee4&t=10625.560000000001s)]
