# Joe Rogan Experience #2248 - Michael Waddell
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo)
*  Joe Rogan podcast, check it out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=0.0s)]
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4.12s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5.12s)]
*  What's going on, my man? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=12.72s)]
*  Joe. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=13.72s)]
*  Is that Bigfoot on your shirt? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=14.72s)]
*  That is. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=15.72s)]
*  It is Bigfoot. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=16.72s)]
*  Non-vegan? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=17.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=18.72s)]
*  How do they know Bigfoot's not a vegan? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=19.72s)]
*  See, I don't know. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=21.72s)]
*  I mean, but I think he's got canines like us, so there's a good chance that he does [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=22.72s)]
*  eat meat, you know? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  I think hunters are the number one argument against Bigfoot being real. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  I've never met a hunter who's seen Bigfoot. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=32.16s)]
*  No, and his amount, especially some of your guests you've had on, and on top of, I mean, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=34.64s)]
*  even myself, and now you spent a lot of times in some pretty desolate places, in all the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=39.28s)]
*  trail cameras. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=43.84s)]
*  We should have gotten one pitcher. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=44.84s)]
*  Yeah, trail cameras throw a big monkey wrench at that Bigfoot thing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  I agree. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=49.64s)]
*  And I'm always, it's still the conspiracy that I'm still, every time I check, especially [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=50.64s)]
*  when you're getting those deep, dark places out west and all throughout the country and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=55.0s)]
*  even the south, I'm thinking, maybe just this time. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=59.08s)]
*  It would be fun. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=62.24s)]
*  It would be fun, but it's just, it's very unlikely. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=63.24s)]
*  There's only like two jaguars in the United States, and they know exactly where they are. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=68.04s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  I was thinking back and even listening, you know, like you had Ronella, of course, Cam, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  a lot of my hunting buddies and people I look up to as well, Remy Warren, all those guys, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  and you start thinking about the amount of time we spend in the woods and we don't even [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  see a mountain lion. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=86.2s)]
*  Or you talk about the wolves, all these wolves are starting to be reintroduced and you still [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=87.72s)]
*  don't see them a lot of times, they're there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=91.88s)]
*  But then again, you capture them on trail cameras, you know, in the middle of the night. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=94.84s)]
*  But yet, Yeti or Sasquatch, only Jack Link's beef jerky has seen him. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=98.2s)]
*  I saw him on the Super Bowl commercial. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they're in a lot of commercials, they're in movies. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=105.88s)]
*  I think they used to be real. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=108.68s)]
*  I think it used to be a real thing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=109.96s)]
*  I mean, they know there's a thing called the Gigantopithecus that lived somewhere around [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  100,000 years ago. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=114.72s)]
*  There was a bipedal hominid that was eight to 10 feet tall. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=115.72s)]
*  Holy cow. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=120.16s)]
*  Look in the orangutan family, I think they believe it was. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=121.16s)]
*  That'd be something to get Graham Hancock on. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=123.8s)]
*  We need to get him back to find that creature. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=125.44s)]
*  He's busy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=130.0s)]
*  He's busy with a lot of other shit. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=131.0s)]
*  It's like just trying to sort out the past, trying to sort out human history. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=133.0s)]
*  That was some of the most intriguing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=138.2s)]
*  I was dug deep into that and then went because of hearing him on the podcast and went and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  watched, just finished season two, watched season one soon after I'd seen him here first. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=146.11999999999998s)]
*  It's pretty compelling. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=150.2s)]
*  It's pretty amazingly compelling. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=151.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=153.6s)]
*  Well, once you realize, first of all, that there's real physical evidence that something [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=154.6s)]
*  happened around 11,800 years ago, that the earth was most likely pounded with asteroid [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  debris and it probably fucked civilization up pretty bad and it can happen again. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=166.72s)]
*  Makes complete sense. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  It's, I mean, hearing his perspective on it and how he researched it and it's from the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  standpoint there's, as we know, politics and everything gets involved in everything. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=180.16s)]
*  It's just almost like he was a journalistic, really smart, intellectual guy who was intrigued. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  It's just a good approach, the way he studied it to me that made it even more compelling. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  And then the findings he did find, I don't know, I just, I was very intrigued by it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=195.68s)]
*  You know how he really got into it? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=201.36s)]
*  He got into it researching the Ark of the Covenant. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=202.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=204.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=205.28s)]
*  Because in Ethiopia, there's a specific church in Ethiopia that has always been rumored to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=206.28s)]
*  be the place where the Ark of the Covenant is stored. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=211.52s)]
*  And there's these guarders of this, these people that are guards of this area and they [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=215.16s)]
*  all develop cataracts. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=219.84s)]
*  They all have like radiation poisoning and they're guarding this one particular area. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=221.44s)]
*  They won't let anybody look at it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=226.1s)]
*  They won't let anybody talk about it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=227.56s)]
*  And Graham got fascinated by this. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=229.44s)]
*  They started doing a deep dive into history and historical accounts of the covenant and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=232.2s)]
*  these, the Ark and all these bizarre stories that have lasted throughout history. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=238.88s)]
*  And the real evidence that there was really sophisticated societies that lived thousands [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=245.0s)]
*  of years ago when we kind of assumed that people were hunters and gatherers. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=250.28s)]
*  Egypt is a great example of that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  Whatever they were doing there was fucking insane. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean the structures that they made, still today we look at them and go, what the hell [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  were you guys doing? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=262.8s)]
*  Like, yeah, how was this made? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=263.8s)]
*  And he believes that society had reached a very, very sophisticated level of technological [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=265.88s)]
*  achievement and then something happened. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=271.68s)]
*  And now we're living in like a rebuild. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=274.32s)]
*  Even though we're very sophisticated in terms of technology, our technology has gone in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=277.44s)]
*  a completely different direction than theirs did. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=282.2s)]
*  And where did Graham ever, in his conclusion in some of that about the covenant, did he [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=284.64s)]
*  ever think that it's still there? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=289.24s)]
*  They think it's still there, yeah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=291.16s)]
*  So some people thought it might have burned up in Jerusalem, I think it was. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=292.64s)]
*  See if you can find where that is, Jamie. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=295.56s)]
*  It's supposed to be in some church in, oh, Jamie's already got it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=298.56s)]
*  I just had watched something on that because I'm intrigued by all that kind of stuff. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=302.36s)]
*  Well, you know, when you really start digging deep into it, it's very fascinating this one [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=306.76s)]
*  particular place has been protected for so long and all these people that have supposedly [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=311.12s)]
*  seen it describe something that's, you know, Trump apparently has like a model of the Ark [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=317.92s)]
*  of the Covenant in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=323.2s)]
*  No way. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=325.12s)]
*  Yeah, see if you can find that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=326.12s)]
*  Yeah, he's got like a recreation of the Ark of the Covenant in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=327.12s)]
*  And that whole covenant was pretty cool based on how, you know, God had said, look, you [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=332.36s)]
*  know, had an intervention saying this is how big it's got to be. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=336.84s)]
*  It was built out of a certain wood, inside and out, gold, the handles, everything was [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=339.64s)]
*  there to hold the commandments. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=345.56s)]
*  And then I, but then I saw something to where, I don't know if Jamie, Jamie and Mike could [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=347.56s)]
*  probably pull it up, but to where some people speculate it could be under the Catholic church. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=352.64s)]
*  I heard that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=357.88s)]
*  Like in the Vatican or something? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=358.88s)]
*  In the Vatican, yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=359.88s)]
*  They got a lot of shit in the Vatican. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=361.44s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=362.44s)]
*  Have you ever been there? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=363.44s)]
*  No, I haven't, but I heard you talk about, you went and had the guide and said it was [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=364.44s)]
*  amazing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=368.08s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=369.08s)]
*  They have so much, they have billions of dollars in art. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=370.08s)]
*  Like where'd you guys steal all this from? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=371.8s)]
*  Back in the Roman days. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=373.48s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=376.56s)]
*  This is Trump's replica of the Ark of the Covenant at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=377.56s)]
*  That's just like, pretty fucking wild. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  And it's almost exactly the replica of what it's assumed to have been looked like, you [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=384.36s)]
*  know? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=390.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's, I think that's a recreation based on biblical accounts. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=391.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  Very strange. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, maybe Trump can take us and show it to us, man. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  That'd be cool. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  What'd you say, Jamie? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=398.59999999999997s)]
*  I was trying to figure out if, I mean, clearly it was there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  It might've just been there temporarily. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=400.92s)]
*  It looks like that might be like on display in Israel or something. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  So it's a replica that travels around. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=406.2s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=408.4s)]
*  Oh, I get you. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=409.4s)]
*  Temporarily, is that Mar-a-Lago? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=410.4s)]
*  I can't find like that it lives there, but there's definitely obviously people with pictures [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=411.4s)]
*  of it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=414.24s)]
*  Bro, if I had Trump money, I'd have one built. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=415.24s)]
*  Oh, why not? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=416.24s)]
*  Like make me another one of these. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=417.24s)]
*  Come on. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=418.24s)]
*  I would too. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a cool thing to have on display. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I wonder what it was. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, if these guys really are guarding it in Ethiopia, like what is the radiation [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=424.04s)]
*  from like? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=428.6s)]
*  Why do they all get developing cataracts and radiation sickness? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=429.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=432.48s)]
*  And we've all watched Harrison Ford try to find it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=433.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=435.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=436.48s)]
*  It's so fun. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=437.48s)]
*  It is fun. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=438.48s)]
*  All that ancient civilization stuff is so fun because it is really kind of a mystery, you [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=439.48s)]
*  know? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=443.32s)]
*  And it's fascinating when, and I'm sure you've been hunting before and you found our arrowheads. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=444.32s)]
*  Yes, a lot. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=449.36s)]
*  When you find one of those, you're picking up this piece of history. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=450.36s)]
*  You got to imagine some Native American was napping this flint on his knee, sitting there, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=453.56s)]
*  who knows how many thousands of years ago. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=459.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=461.92s)]
*  They find 3000, 4000 year old arrowheads and you just got to go, God, what was life like [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=462.92s)]
*  then, man? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=468.56s)]
*  I can only imagine. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=469.56s)]
*  And like where I'm from in Georgia, and obviously you and I both love archery, but all the arrowheads [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=470.56s)]
*  I find are quartz. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=476.28000000000003s)]
*  So we have very little flint and I'm not at all historically sound on understanding everything. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=478.76s)]
*  I mean, I got friends. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=483.67999999999995s)]
*  Actually, Jeff Foxworthy is one of those guys. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=484.88s)]
*  He lives right down the road. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=487.08s)]
*  He is obsessed with Indian artifacts and has an amazing collection. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=488.55999999999995s)]
*  Like goes across the country. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=492.4s)]
*  You know, it's hard. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=493.4s)]
*  You can call Jeff right now. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=494.4s)]
*  You probably can't get him to Austin to come do this podcast, but then all you got to do [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=495.4s)]
*  is tell him, hey, man, I just plowed up a field and it rained and we just found two [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  nice flint heads. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  He'd probably be here tomorrow. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, he loves it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  He's eat up with it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  Fitness isn't just about what you do in the gym. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=507.16s)]
*  It's also about your nutrition. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=508.88000000000005s)]
*  But even with the best diet, some nutrients can be hard to get and AG1 can help fill those [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=510.32000000000005s)]

*  Seriously get on this. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=576.0s)]
*  This is a dude I know who has a ranch out here and he finds them all the time. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=577.16s)]
*  It's Comanche territory where his ranch is in the hill country. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  And he every day. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=584.12s)]
*  Go to that guy's page. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=586.2s)]
*  Witworth, JW Witworth, JM Witworth, JW Witworth. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=587.8000000000001s)]
*  I think it's JW. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=591.2s)]
*  But he's got incredible arrowheads that he's like just obsessed with finding them on this [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=593.6s)]
*  ranch and this ranch apparently was just overrun by the Comanche. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=598.72s)]
*  It's very fertile and rich and you know soil is great and a lot of you know water habitat, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=602.24s)]
*  a lot of deer. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=608.32s)]
*  And so they must have just camped there and lived there for a long time. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=609.6s)]
*  It's JM but it's also private. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=612.6s)]
*  Oh it is? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=614.5200000000001s)]
*  Oh he's private now? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=616.52s)]
*  That's probably because we blew him up. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=617.92s)]
*  I think that's when he went private. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=619.92s)]
*  Because he didn't used to be private but that's some of the things that he finds. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=623.12s)]
*  See that's amazingly beautiful stuff. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=625.92s)]
*  He sent me a couple of them. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=627.3199999999999s)]
*  There's a company I found, actually I was in Illinois at this, it was a beer and deer [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=629.52s)]
*  fest in Illinois and I went by this booth. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=635.16s)]
*  See that is absolutely gorgeous. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=638.0s)]
*  Yeah Remy said that that was probably used for fishing. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=639.92s)]
*  Very well could have been. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=643.12s)]
*  It's so large you said it's probably used to shoot fish. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=644.12s)]
*  It seems that a lot of the arrowheads are you know the ones that was actually attached [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=647.32s)]
*  to shoot with archery were a lot smaller. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=652.72s)]
*  Like you know some people might argue that I don't know enough about it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=654.92s)]
*  Like is it a spearhead? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=658.04s)]
*  I found some heads like look at this I found. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=659.04s)]
*  Like well that's a spearhead or that's this or that. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=660.88s)]
*  You find somebody like Remy or I got a friend named Ike Rainey who's really big into artifacts [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=662.72s)]
*  and if you find something what you think it is. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=668.84s)]
*  It's kind of like the first time I hunted in Africa. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=670.88s)]
*  I thought I'd shot a spring buck or I thought I shot a diker and it turned out it was a [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=672.84s)]
*  spring buck. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=677.68s)]
*  It's like oh okay there's only 7,000 species of animals out here. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=678.68s)]
*  So I think arrowheads are the same way. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=682.52s)]
*  It's amazing but to think you're right. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=684.72s)]
*  I mean think of somebody sat down thousands and thousands of years and napped that out [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=686.52s)]
*  and how many times did they not get it right? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=691.48s)]
*  You can say that's perfect. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=693.24s)]
*  Yeah they probably had to do a lot of them. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=695.0s)]
*  A lot of them probably broke off wrong. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=696.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=698.64s)]
*  It's probably not a very good success rate especially when you're working with flint [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=699.64s)]
*  and just chipping away at it but when they get good at it it's such an art. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=703.36s)]
*  When you pick one up like a real flint arrowhead god there's a lot of guys that make them now [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=708.6s)]
*  though unfortunately so there's a lot of forgeries. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=712.72s)]
*  Correct. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=715.8s)]
*  Yeah a lot of nerds, a lot of archery nerds they get real good at it and then just leave [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=716.8s)]
*  them scattered around places or pretend they found it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=720.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=723.36s)]
*  You know? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=724.36s)]
*  You could do that. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=725.36s)]
*  You totally could do that but that's a legit one that was actually pulled out of the ground. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=726.36s)]
*  It makes me less whine when you know like if you're out in Utah and you have success [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=729.72s)]
*  in Elkwoods and you're butchering an elk and trying to get them packed out when you're [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=734.1800000000001s)]
*  just having to re-sharpen your knife. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=737.72s)]
*  Like this is the least I can do is re-sharpen this knife. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=739.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=741.16s)]
*  Remember these guys had to nap out ahead. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=742.16s)]
*  I mean how long did that take just to go hunt an elk you know? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=743.16s)]
*  Yeah they lived for thousands of years with no metal. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=745.4s)]
*  Oh I know. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=748.72s)]
*  I'll tell you something that's interesting. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=749.72s)]
*  We hunted a place in Montana where it was on the Milk River and they had what they called [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=750.88s)]
*  a buffalo drop on this property. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=754.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=756.9200000000001s)]
*  And so if you went to where this buffalo drop was you could go to the base of it and [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=757.96s)]
*  you could find there's not there wasn't any much left now. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=763.2800000000001s)]
*  We used to hunt back in the day mostly in the I hadn't been since 2000. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=765.72s)]
*  I think it was seven or 2010 was the last time I had went out there. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=770.0400000000001s)]
*  But at the base of that you used to find all kind of bones you know bison bones you know [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=773.88s)]
*  buffalo and stuff but you would sometimes find these little tiny heads and they didn't [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=778.8000000000001s)]
*  look like this. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=784.24s)]
*  They're real small. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=785.24s)]
*  Which is interesting what Remy brought up. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=786.24s)]
*  Maybe that was for fishing or something. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=787.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=789.28s)]
*  But all the heads we would find would be tiny little almost like bird points is what I felt [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=790.28s)]
*  like I wanted to call them. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=794.44s)]
*  I heard them call before and supposedly what they did was is they didn't necessarily weren't [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=795.6s)]
*  trying to kill the buffalo. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=800.8s)]
*  They would hurt them and they would just kind of peck them with the arrows and then they [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=802.94s)]
*  would run the buffalo off of this cliff. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=808.04s)]
*  And so it basically died coming off the cliff and it was so cool across the valley you could [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=810.4s)]
*  still see all those stone rings to where supposedly the ladies or the squaws would [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=816.08s)]
*  sit there and look back and soon as the men basically had you know whatever amount of [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=820.6s)]
*  buffalo I guess over the drop they would come and butcher and the man would go back and [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=825.76s)]
*  you know smoke the peace pipe and relax. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=830.4000000000001s)]
*  So times have changed a lot. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=833.0400000000001s)]
*  So Remy was telling me about this one site where they had a buffalo drop and the pile [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=835.36s)]
*  was so large and there was so much decay that it actually created a fire. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=841.64s)]
*  Holy cow. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=847.08s)]
*  It like started on fire because they're all just rotting and fermenting and there's some [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=848.08s)]
*  sort of combustion and so the entire side of the cliff was black from these buffalo [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=852.4399999999999s)]
*  falling off of this place rotting and then combusting. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=859.4s)]
*  Created a fire. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=863.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=864.12s)]
*  I mean I don't even know how that would work. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=865.12s)]
*  I don't either but I do know that those buffalo drops do exist and it's pretty fascinating [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=866.16s)]
*  and the place we're hunting is a private landowner. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=871.2s)]
*  He was a rancher, had some cows and he was very funny. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=874.9s)]
*  He did not want us to video on any of our episodes or anything to do and back then we [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=878.84s)]
*  were videoing. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=882.84s)]
*  I was working with Bill Jordan and we had a show on TNN back in the day and he's like [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=884.92s)]
*  do not bring your cameras. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=889.04s)]
*  I don't want any TV cameras around here because they'll come and all of a sudden they'll [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=890.4s)]
*  set this up as a historical site and I'll have so he was really funny about it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=894.68s)]
*  So I don't even I didn't even take a lot of pictures of it because I was always like hey [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=898.88s)]
*  you know this guy didn't want us to take any pictures and talk about it but man every time [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=902.56s)]
*  I'd come back you know for morning hunt or we'd go scout I'd come back and like man I [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=906.3199999999999s)]
*  want to go to Buffalo Drop like you know you just like a little kid like a little 10 year [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=910.36s)]
*  old kid boy scout and like look at this here's a head or here's a buffalo horn or skull and [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=913.48s)]
*  most of everything that would have been there had already been picked through because it's [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=918.72s)]
*  right off kind of a county road and so most of the locals knew about it and of course [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=922.7199999999999s)]
*  you know he's had kids and grandkids just kind of rummaged through it but it was pretty [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=926.64s)]
*  interesting but every time you'd go you'd find something so it was really interesting. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=930.8s)]
*  It just just really stretches your mind and your imagination to imagine living like that [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=934.9599999999999s)]
*  back then and that these people while you know Rome was being built the Colosseum Europe [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=939.9599999999999s)]
*  all this all these different places the world these people were living the same way people [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=946.8399999999999s)]
*  live tens of thousands of years ago right here. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=951.0s)]
*  It's crazy and now it seems like we're so far removed from it but yet as we talk about [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=953.6s)]
*  it that romance hadn't left and even getting a chance to chase a bull elk there's still [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=959.2800000000001s)]
*  some amazing rural wild places out there that we can kind of revisit and that was the first [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=964.1s)]
*  thing I noticed is all the Native American pictures you had I hunt a lot with Native [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=969.0s)]
*  Americans a lot with the Navajo Nation I've become like family or they become like family [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=974.76s)]
*  to me I go out there every year and the resources they have you know I know Cam hunts a lot [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=978.92s)]
*  you know as a musk-el-aro and different different places and I don't know man and even sadly [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=984.12s)]
*  even amongst the Native some of that culture is being lost with them more and so we even [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=988.68s)]
*  go out every year and do a hunt with their kids we take 15 to 20 Navajo youth hunting [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=994.24s)]
*  every year out there with the Navajo game and fish and they have a lot of mentors Gloria [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=999.16s)]
*  Tom who she's just stepping down but she was the kind of in charge out there and we would [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1003.98s)]
*  go and work with people like Jeff Cole and that whole Navajo Nation the families and [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1009.0s)]
*  we'd take just their kids the kids of the Navajo Nation hunting and sadly enough they're [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1012.2800000000001s)]
*  like a lot of kids in America eating little debbies and playing Xbox you know it's like [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1017.96s)]
*  man you got 17 million acres in your backyard come on bro you're supposed to be the damn [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1021.32s)]
*  eagle you gotta you gotta fly and dip down when we got you know I'm even out here you [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1027.44s)]
*  know it's your room and we me too I have all kind of Native Americans my heroes were [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1031.72s)]
*  Native American hunters like Ishi who taught Pope and Young how to bow hunt he's who got [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1038.68s)]
*  him really yeah Ishi out of California I think he he come back and he basically taught those [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1043.64s)]
*  guys who were doctors he introduced them to to bow hunting and then Pope and Young as [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1051.64s)]
*  we kill an elk we think oh is he big enough to go Pope and Young right explain to people [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1056.76s)]
*  what Pope and Young is for people don't know what we're talking about Pope and Young is [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1060.36s)]
*  so basically Pope and Young were two guys that basically just kind of revolutionized [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1064.04s)]
*  archery as we know it a lot of times I mean obviously throwing around names you got to [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1068.28s)]
*  talk about Fredbear stuff like that but prior to that there was an Indian named Ishi out of a [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1072.12s)]
*  California tribe and I'm not good enough at remembering exactly what tribe that was but [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1077.24s)]
*  there's a lot of cool information that you can read obviously if you ever get your hands on [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1082.12s)]
*  Saxton Pope and Arthur Young any books it's fascinating like my favorite book of all time [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1087.0s)]
*  is called The Adventurous Bowman a friend of mine Jeff Johnson who's a writer gave it to me and I [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1091.1599999999999s)]
*  read it all the time and even my kid I read him that book at night you know and this talks about [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1095.7199999999998s)]
*  their first venture into Africa and and when they went there when they hunted grizzly when they [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1099.9599999999998s)]
*  hunted elk the first time and so these guys were kind of based on what I can assume seemed to be [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1103.9599999999998s)]
*  pretty much city slickers who had basically a patient called Ishi who taught them how to [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1109.7199999999998s)]
*  hunt and and pictures of him you can still see him he looks like he's dressed in a Ted Nugent [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1115.72s)]
*  concert in 1969 you know jumping off the amps and and so yeah and so now that's become similar [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1120.04s)]
*  to Boone and Crockett Pope and Young is an organization that's formed around you know [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1127.0s)]
*  celebrating certain animals that are trophy aspect and if you get a you know say a whitetail deer [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1131.72s)]
*  that nets 125 inches on the Pope and Young scale you can enter them into the Pope and Young record [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1136.6s)]
*  books and every category of species like elk bear caribou moose so on and so forth has that [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1141.88s)]
*  and so it's just kind of to celebrate a lot of the heritage of archery and so Pope and Young a [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1147.48s)]
*  lot of people don't know it but that that basically is the basis of what it comes from but it starts [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1152.2s)]
*  back to guess what a Native American these arrowheads they passed it on and so now we're kind of [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1157.0800000000002s)]
*  carrying on that same tradition and so as a student of the game it's like it's so cool to talk about [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1163.3200000000002s)]
*  there they are oh look at that yeah wow look at that that's cool is there any can you find [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1168.52s)]
*  Jamie is that issue that look all the things Saxton Pope right there's issue there [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1175.24s)]
*  can you imagine look at that you're learning from the source yeah i mean they and and there's so [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1180.12s)]
*  many amazing stories what year was this man i don't even know it had to been in the uh [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1186.76s)]
*  i don't know was it 20s or maybe maybe maybe 1900 i know it's early you know it's fascinating [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1192.04s)]
*  when you think about what we enjoy we enjoy archery 1912 1912 so that guy you know that that is like [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1198.36s)]
*  he was alive in the 1800s absolutely so he was doing that like that's literally from the source [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1205.56s)]
*  and there's another thing and it's it's crazy to think about this another thing i read and heard [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1212.6s)]
*  read and heard told because obviously you know you travel around and it's always trying to figure [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1217.56s)]
*  out you know what's fact or fiction but i'd listen to uh casey means on this podcast we're talking [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1222.2s)]

*  of milk should i even partake but um i think he gained a lot of weight started getting a lot [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1247.8s)]
*  sicker just in the food back then was so much better than the food we have now yeah yeah just [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1252.9199999999998s)]
*  around a lot of people and all of a sudden he was trying to fight probably viruses and diseases and [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1257.8s)]
*  getting an abundance of a certain food he wasn't used to and supposedly i think he got a little [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1263.6399999999999s)]
*  heavier and less healthy just being around probably a lot of grains and sugar probably i'm sure yeah [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1267.8s)]
*  he's probably eating mostly meat before that probably so yeah just a fish fish out the creek [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1273.16s)]
*  and yeah you know backstrap out of a mule deer the way everybody did for thousands of years yep [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1277.88s)]
*  it's just so interesting that if it wasn't for guys like pope and young and fredbear i mean how [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1282.52s)]
*  many people were evangelizing bow hunting back then i mean how many people were making it something [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1287.64s)]
*  that was you know because as soon as rifles came along the way everybody looked at it was oh rifles [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1293.3200000000002s)]
*  are better you can shoot something further it's easier to do you hunt you hunt with rifles but to [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1299.24s)]
*  make that choice this decision that there's something more more connected more spiritual [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1305.0s)]
*  about archery and bow hunting if it wasn't for those people that were promoting it people like [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1310.52s)]
*  fredbear correct who was so he was so articulate in the way he would describe things and the way he [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1315.88s)]
*  would describe the benefits of just archery practice about how archery just removes your cares [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1322.84s)]
*  yeah if you could just concentrate on that target and just just practice archery it cleans your mind [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1329.72s)]
*  and i find that today i do too it's almost like you go back in time every time even though we pick [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1335.48s)]
*  up you know these new hoyt bows you're like oh my god look at the technology it's a lot more accurate [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1341.56s)]
*  it is it's so much more accurate and so uh yeah it's it's amazing and you're just exactly right [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1346.36s)]
*  it is spiritual and to think back of where it was to where it is but then you think about the rifles [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1352.12s)]
*  and the technology we have there but keep in mind i'm sure uh you know in those people who are really [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1357.08s)]
*  hunting for substance absolutely if if we leave tomorrow and we can't go and get us a nice steak [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1362.9199999999998s)]
*  dinner or we can't go to the grocery store and buy us some chicken or rib eye whatever it is we [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1368.4399999999998s)]
*  decide to eat well absolutely if we're like hey joe your wife and my wife is wanting us to kill [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1373.4799999999998s)]
*  a few squirrels and uh we're gonna have squirrels and gravy and my wife makes some good biscuits [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1378.36s)]
*  it's like why don't you know let's leave the hoits at home let's take a 22 and a 410 let's [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1383.0s)]
*  just go get us a mess of squirrel yeah and so i think probably they looked at it that way and [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1387.32s)]
*  once that came about and then it slowly becomes somewhat of a i hate to even say it as a sport [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1390.9199999999998s)]
*  because i don't look at it as a sport it's a culture it's a it's a discipline but i think [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1397.7199999999998s)]
*  to know that we're still going back and celebrating that and still talking about issue [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1402.52s)]
*  and pope and young and the fred bears and what they set forth and even people like chuck adams [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1406.84s)]
*  who was always one of my heroes um you know cam and i were talking a lot about that in texas just [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1411.24s)]
*  golly chuck adams was hunting these elk and always had that little green beanie [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1417.1599999999999s)]
*  shot those double x 78 arrows and man you what nobody is like you know all the kids and even me [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1421.08s)]
*  you know i was this little chubby white kid that thought if i bought aera jordan's i could jump [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1427.1599999999999s)]
*  higher and michael lied to me man you're a liar jordan i can't jump any faster i can't run any [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1430.2s)]
*  faster but you know chuck when i saw those arrows and i'd see that bow i like man i gotta have that [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1437.96s)]
*  i want to be like chuck you know i want to be like fred bear and so uh it's just amazing to see and [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1444.04s)]
*  to see that we still are celebrating it so yeah well it has a very deep connection to the human [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1449.72s)]
*  mind there's something about archery that i think it's because as human beings evolved you know we [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1455.8s)]
*  developed the bow and arrow they invented it they they refined it and that was how people hunted [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1462.04s)]
*  and got their food i think there's a genetic memory of that that's inside of our heads [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1467.48s)]
*  because there's like there's something eerily satisfying about hitting a target with an arrow [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1471.6399999999999s)]
*  it's so much different than anything like i like practicing shooting rifles i like i've hunted with [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1477.3999999999999s)]
*  rifles i like it i like it it's great same it's not the same it's not the same it's not the same [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1483.32s)]
*  it's like a 10x 10-fold different yeah it's it's uh it really is amazing it's like every time [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1489.0s)]
*  if i go rifle hunting i love it i mean i absolutely love it still love the whole culture of it i grew [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1497.72s)]
*  up in georgia where i mean people were on these leases you know it'd be a mead mead property which [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1502.76s)]
*  was timberland or georgia power lease there'd be 10 of us on 500 acres or sometimes more than that [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1508.44s)]
*  and so you know everybody took a 30-06 remington semi-automatic you know scope on it with over and [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1515.16s)]
*  under sites and we'd meet up at uncle morgan's barn me and my dad and scott steiner my uncle [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1521.24s)]

*  guys high-fiving and we would walk back there and hunt with a rifle and as soon as you heard a rifle [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1536.04s)]
*  shot like that was uncle tommy i bet you he's got a big one you know and so it was just so amazing [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1541.0s)]
*  that part of it so i still go back and do that from a culture standpoint to feel just that feeling [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1546.92s)]
*  and vibe of being standing there in a pair of k-mart boots with some old walls coveralls draped [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1553.24s)]
*  over with them a white long handles you know that we thought we could go to the anarchy end in [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1558.6s)]
*  reality it was just some cotton it once soon as it got wet she froze to death and uh and just the [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1563.24s)]
*  thought of that of being literally in my time 11 12 years old just being one of the men with a 30 [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1567.72s)]

*  my dad's construction job that was the most unsafe thing in the world and a lot of people got hurt [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1577.56s)]
*  falling out of those things and i remember we got our first bow my dad and i my dad had an old brown [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1583.64s)]

*  80s because i 66 because i feel like uh wow that's wild price so low hunters can't afford to be [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1695.08s)]
*  without one the way they used to market things back then it's so funny i know i love to see those [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=1703.72s)]

*  it that's just it obviously might even be a real thing but the descriptions of it were backed up [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=2460.12s)]
*  by multiple people huh a carnivore that chose to hunt or devour nearly whatever it wants to save [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=2465.3199999999997s)]

*  the cheetah but then it hit me it's like he was talking about the movies well bambi is so real to [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=3975.0s)]
*  them the fox and the hound i mean it's so real it's like you know somehow you know they think [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=3979.7200000000003s)]
*  that you go to antarctica or or north pole and these polar bears are sitting having having a soda [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=3985.7200000000003s)]

*  and they come hunt you they wait a minute a seal that we got to wait days for him to come out the [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4002.76s)]
*  hole and hunt them down or look there's a dude that's been eating a lot of fried chicken and [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4007.4s)]
*  collard greens and cornbread i bet that sucker i bet he can't run fast let's go eat him and so [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4012.36s)]
*  it's just a disconnect of not knowing and thinking that everything is almost like [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4019.88s)]
*  going to the zoo and then when it becomes hard you know in your two or three days in and you're [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4023.88s)]
*  not had opportunities like dude what is going on like it's we're hunting i mean i've even had [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4028.92s)]
*  them like dude i thought you were good i mean well i'm trying i'm trying it's just this animal [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4035.48s)]
*  it does not want to get on your plate you know it's not an easy thing to do no and when that's [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4041.56s)]
*  also the problem with hunting shows is there's a hunting show if it's a half an hour show it's [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4046.04s)]
*  22 minutes of actual footage and so you're boiling down a 10-day hunt to 22 minutes and [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4050.76s)]
*  the reality is that gives a distorted perception to the people at home like oh it's easy it's they [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4056.1200000000003s)]
*  just go there they put the animal on their crosshair that's not fair you hear that all the time that's [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4061.48s)]
*  not fair like survival's not fair you think it's fair that the lion gets to kill the gazelle it's [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4066.1200000000003s)]
*  not fair no of course it's not fair there's nothing fair in nature why are elephants big why are mice [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4071.4s)]
*  small there's nothing fair no this fair doesn't factor in this is what you're trying to do you're [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4076.76s)]
*  trying to survive obviously you can go to the store but out here there's no fucking stores [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4082.1200000000003s)]
*  no so out here if you want to survive if you want to if we lived here forever this is the only [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4086.6800000000003s)]
*  environment you're ever going to be here till your heart stops beating correct this is the only one [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4092.76s)]
*  way you've got to figure out the wind you got to figure out where they are you got to pattern them [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4097.0s)]
*  you got to figure out how to sneak up on them you got to figure out how to execute a shot without [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4101.72s)]
*  getting buck fever yeah you got to do all these things like this is the only way it's so deep [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4106.2s)]
*  you're right and it is difficult you just can't boil it down to 10 like Pedro does a really good [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4111.32s)]
*  job of showing like how difficult it is on these crazy adventure hunts that he does but even still [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4116.5199999999995s)]
*  it's an hour or hour and a half like the reality is it's 10 fucking days man 10 days that's right [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4122.12s)]
*  10 to 12 miles a day sweating your ass off coming back exhausted your feet hurt your back's killing [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4127.16s)]
*  you and just a lot and you sleep so hard you sleep like a dead man and then that alarm clock [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4133.24s)]
*  goes off at 4 30 you get some coffee in you with a jet boil and you're freezing you're trying to [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4138.04s)]
*  warm your hands up and then you're off again yep it still almost feels like i always talk about [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4144.84s)]
*  hunting and open today it's kind of like christmas it's like uh you know when you finally do get to [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4151.08s)]

*  and excited and then all of a sudden you finally fall in a deep sleep and all of a sudden like [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4173.4s)]
*  but then all of a sudden it's kind of like as a kid when you wait on santa claus it's like man i'm [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4179.4s)]

*  to make someone laugh and they're digging on the stuff that you're performing there's got to be a [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4318.04s)]
*  a natural high that comes with it so there becomes an addictive quality to it and it's not [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4323.96s)]
*  necessarily about the money it's just a certain situation that feels good so you wonder like when [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4328.28s)]

*  much more powerful than anything else you have in life other than the birth of your children [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4568.679999999999s)]

*  so especially like archery elk hunting or archery mule deer hunting probably even more difficult [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4626.2s)]
*  i agree it is so hard to do to get someone addicted to that boy you gotta you've gotta get a special [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4631.88s)]
*  kind of person that's willing to like the learning curve is so long and the physicality of that high [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4639.4s)]

*  not ducking mountain lions for five six years and they know any little snap of a branch any little [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4652.36s)]
*  like moving of a rock that sounds like it might have been a predator's paw oh yeah they're on a [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4659.96s)]
*  swivel they're up and they're bouncing boing boing boing see ya they're going and that's what other [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4664.44s)]
*  thing people don't realize you know they think oh you you hunters are going out there and you know [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4669.96s)]
*  getting these animals and you know obviously the hunters have such a responsibility and the balance [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4674.759999999999s)]
*  of of a lot of things you know and mother nature is first of all very brutal and there's a lot to [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4679.719999999999s)]
*  be learned through nature there's a lot of things we think we know but then if you really dig deep [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4684.04s)]
*  and you're in the mountains you realize wait a minute that was all human nature this is nature [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4688.679999999999s)]
*  there's a difference you know so many examples that you can get into but at the end of the day [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4693.0s)]
*  these deer also have coyotes now they reintroduce wolves in some of these places [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4698.76s)]
*  and they have done studies that in some cases they feel like an adult male mountain lion can kill up [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4703.48s)]
*  to a hundred mule deer one mountain lion so you're talking 80 to 100 animals that they kill so when [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4709.72s)]
*  you think about us even if we're athletic is that a year that's a year that's one and they've done [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4716.76s)]
*  all kind of studies i know the the state of utah has been really proactive which is great and what [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4723.08s)]
*  i love about utah game of fish is what they're doing they're listening to a lot of these [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4729.400000000001s)]
*  mountaineering type of guys who are not you know have a doctorate in biology or are balancing [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4733.88s)]
*  nature they're just ranchers they're outfitters they're hunters they're somebody that's immersed [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4740.360000000001s)]
*  themselves and you know they might not can sit there and recite shakespeare but they can certainly [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4744.68s)]
*  tell you what they've seen they don't claim to know it all but they can tell you things that they [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4751.240000000001s)]
*  are seeing out there there's different kinds of intelligence 100 yeah and a lot of and a lot of [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4755.08s)]
*  the game of fish sometimes we'll get at times arrogant to say well what what am i going to [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4760.6s)]
*  learn from a joe what am i going to learn from michael wadell what am i remmy warren come on dude [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4767.88s)]
*  okay you hunt a lot but you know i got a doctorate in this well like california is a great example [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4772.12s)]
*  like a lot of their game and fish i don't even think they call it game and fish i think they [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4777.48s)]
*  call it fish and wildlife correct yeah because they don't want the the concept of game to be [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4781.5599999999995s)]
*  introduced meaning hunted they they're their thought is they want to get it to the point [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4786.5199999999995s)]
*  where the predators and the prey balance each other out where there's no need for hunting [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4792.2s)]
*  and they would like to reintroduce wolves to help and that they do that's it's animal activists that [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4797.24s)]
*  have taken these positions that should be held by wildlife biologists who have an objective [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4802.12s)]
*  understanding of the populations and how to keep them healthy and the way they're doing in california [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4807.0s)]
*  is you got mountain lions everywhere yeah in this one ranch that i hunt they had a water hole they [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4811.72s)]
*  had a pond and they had a trail cam they found 18 different cats that visited this trail cam [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4817.96s)]
*  see that 18 different mountain lions that goes beyond what biologists will tell you as a matter [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4824.759999999999s)]
*  of fact a lot of times a lot of the studies are now it's been changed and everything the goal [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4829.4s)]
*  poster being adjusted but there was a time i think it was 28 square mile radius that i know at least [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4834.599999999999s)]
*  in the state of utah so i'm not saying every game of fish department you know i call it our fishing [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4841.0s)]
*  game our fish and wildlife would say but they had specifically they said a male mountain lion [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4845.639999999999s)]
*  basically controlled 28 miles diameter only to find that in utah i've got some friends and [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4851.64s)]
*  outfitters that went out there when they did have the quota tags now you can just buy a tag over [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4858.280000000001s)]
*  the counter and you can or get depredation you can hunt mountain lion all the time because they [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4863.240000000001s)]
*  realize look these mountain lions are killing a lot of a lot of mule deer specifically on top of [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4867.08s)]
*  that you can't can don't know what the winner is going to be and what that's going to kill then you [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4871.400000000001s)]
*  got wolves you got bears you got all this stuff this outfitter took a business card and he put it [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4875.0s)]
*  down he said well i know y'all think this but i want to show you all what i filled the quota [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4880.84s)]
*  he said i shot 10 mountain lions in this business card he said three of them was here so your theory [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4884.68s)]
*  that one male mountain lion is in this 28 mile diameter is completely busted this is not on [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4892.2s)]
*  anything i've studied i didn't go to harvard i didn't go to auburn university in the wildlife [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4898.360000000001s)]
*  department i don't have trail cameras out there i'm just telling you that with red bone hounds [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4902.4400000000005s)]
*  this is a true statistic here's the photos and so what has happened a lot of those people got [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4907.0s)]
*  together and what i love about utah they are listening and they're saying okay this old [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4912.4400000000005s)]
*  so hillbilly knows something let's listen to him and so they're adjusting and now the deer [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4918.28s)]
*  numbers are going up the hunting is getting better and uh and and it's unfortunate that [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4922.68s)]
*  that really some of these people might be right that nature does have a great way of balancing [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4928.36s)]
*  itself very more way more brutal than what you and i would approach the management process [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4933.16s)]
*  but everything's changing i mean you know you talk about california you talk about how they [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4939.5599999999995s)]
*  reintroduced the wolf say in colorado well all that was voted in in a very urban area [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4944.12s)]
*  specifically aspen all the ranchers i don't think it should be voted in at all it shouldn't be [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4948.76s)]
*  ballot biology to me is ridiculous it don't make sense you should have to have an understanding [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4953.5599999999995s)]
*  about what you're voting on from perspective of the people that are actually in the field [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=4957.8s)]

*  kind of bringing some some light to that and give him an opportunity to talk and so [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5335.96s)]
*  i find across the board same conversation i had talking to some squirrel hunters uh talking about [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5341.24s)]

*  haines runs quickly to the top of the mountain and i sat down and i called him off the mountain [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5373.64s)]
*  i got i'm gonna figure out how to communicate with him you know and i said there's a lot of [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5377.96s)]
*  different ways to crack there's a lot of different ways of skin to cat as they would say but at the [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5381.08s)]
*  end of the day uh i was talking to some squirrel hunters over in alabama and these guys prototypical [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5384.68s)]
*  what you'd pull up looked like billy colman from where the red fern grows you know had had squirrel [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5390.2s)]
*  dogs and and one of the guys uh he had to be in his 60s and uh literally i had some chew in the [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5395.96s)]
*  back he said man you friends without cameron haines and i said i am i said i i i've known [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5401.32s)]
*  camera a long time he said man he seemed like a good dude and i don't know why it hit me like [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5406.5199999999995s)]
*  this guy i wouldn't expect to mention cameron and so quickly um i contacted cameron i said man has [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5411.24s)]
*  had a cool conversation and so he and i quickly kind of said man why why have we not even hunted [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5417.4s)]
*  together like we've been at trade shows and stuff and done some stuff and and uh so that's been [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5422.599999999999s)]
*  really cool for me that old friend i've known a long time to get back in camp and the conversations [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5427.96s)]

*  so i think one of the beautiful things about social media for hunting and podcasts for hunting is that [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5438.28s)]
*  people have an opportunity to hear completely different perspective about what it is that [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5443.72s)]
*  wasn't available before that i got into hunting because i started watching spirit of the wild [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5448.360000000001s)]
*  i love that that's when i got fascinated with it and then i watched ronnell's original show [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5455.72s)]

*  that show she also worked with bourdain and so you know i was friends with bourdain and so i got [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5479.08s)]
*  introduced to them through that and helen got steve on the show he didn't even know what a podcast [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5486.04s)]

*  different skill set and so uh we all grow up a little different and so again i just assumed [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5576.76s)]
*  growing up in my small little area just out of uh manchester woodbury georgia um [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5583.0s)]

*  no lights there but i just really assumed everybody did and i was just completely devastated when i [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5598.12s)]
*  went to the city and you know and i'd tell somebody like man you know what do you do is like man i [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5604.2s)]

*  anti-hunting i've never had i didn't know it existed i mean i was that naive i did not know [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5625.24s)]
*  when you first encountered people that were anti-hunting i was in my early 20s wow i was [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5630.04s)]
*  in my early 20s and how hard was it to wrap your head around that it blew me away and people that [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5635.24s)]
*  eat meat too by the way yeah i mean it really hit me when i started traveling i literally was like [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5640.36s)]
*  a kid that was just you know getting up every morning for christmas i was having a chance to [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5647.0s)]
*  work for bill jordan and i met him through winning a turkey calling contest and um he asked me him [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5652.04s)]
*  and david blanton i can't say enough great things about bill and david david blanton believed in me [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5657.56s)]
*  when i mean he always believed in me so much and he said hey man we'd love you to help guide [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5663.080000000001s)]
*  hunters and back then everything around hunting was media outdoor live field and stream so there [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5667.240000000001s)]
*  wasn't any hunting shows but then about that same time tnn after these nascar races introduced an [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5672.360000000001s)]
*  outdoor block which if you go back and look people like jackie bushman uh at the time what year was [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5678.76s)]
*  this would have been for me been 90 it had been a 92 or three or four somewhere right in there [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5684.839999999999s)]
*  did they even have range finders back then no range finders i bought the first one i'd ever [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5689.719999999999s)]
*  seen it was a bush nail and i still work with bush now the thing looked like a car battery [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5693.719999999999s)]
*  literally you know i had safety straps i had like chains i like one strongest man contest to hold [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5699.08s)]
*  this thing up but uh they had the little ones you could roll and it didn't even tell you when the [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5705.08s)]
*  temperature changes it's going to give you an inaccurate it's going to change with the weather [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5710.44s)]
*  but no it was you know just guessing but uh was it a laser range it was the the the first ones [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5714.599999999999s)]
*  was like a roller you rolled two things i forget how exactly it worked but it come and it gave you [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5720.28s)]
*  basically a rough estimate a rough estimate and it'd be like 42 yard 40 yards and then bush now [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5725.5599999999995s)]
*  to my knowledge come out with one it was a bigger one it looked like i said it kind of looked like [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5732.5199999999995s)]
*  a small battery is big and it had a laser on it and you could range it and it gave you [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5737.0s)]
*  you know the yardage and obviously it wasn't angle compensating it didn't have any of the arc the [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5742.04s)]
*  angle range compensation had any of that and the first person i ever saw that even talked about [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5747.32s)]
*  that was chuck adams i was videoing with him back in those tnn days and and she explained to people [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5751.96s)]
*  like the angle compensation is like an arrow uh is quicker going downhill so if you're shooting [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5757.56s)]
*  uphill or downhill the angle you have to gauge how fast the arrow is going to go the feet per [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5763.64s)]
*  second based on the angle so if it might look like it's 50 yards as the crow flies yeah your [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5769.64s)]
*  your range fighter might say 42 correct and you got to put your rain you got to put your side at [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5776.12s)]
*  42 yards otherwise it'll shoot right over its back and it works yeah it works really well it's [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5780.12s)]
*  unbelievable and and um that to me i didn't know existed and you're fucked around with those garment [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5784.76s)]
*  sites no i haven't i've always wanted to try one it's great in theory and great when it works [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5789.8s)]
*  so when it works yeah i've had a problem with it a couple of times and i gave up on them and i'm [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5796.6s)]
*  hoping they're going to get better and they then they outlawed them in utah i tried to bring it to [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5802.04s)]
*  utah a couple years ago and they had passed a law maybe last year and um the best thing about it [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5806.4400000000005s)]
*  though it's like a red dot you get the dot you have a clear sight picture you can see just that [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5812.360000000001s)]
*  dot just that dot on the vitals it's amazing and the the fact that you could go to full draw [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5817.8s)]
*  and just press a button to range and then say maybe the animal moves 15 yards to the left [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5822.92s)]
*  press it again and you get a range and you have a perfect shot but some people think that that's [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5828.04s)]
*  cheating that's but it's the same it's just taking a step out instead of picking your range finder [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5833.72s)]
*  off your bino pouch and checking it and then changing your sight and then drawing back with [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5839.320000000001s)]
*  this you're doing it right from draw so from full draw you can just keep getting ranges [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5845.24s)]
*  and then you can also hit it once and then a second time and you'll get pins so you get 20 to 80 [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5849.639999999999s)]
*  nice yeah so even if you so then all your pins that come up exactly based on that but if you just [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5856.2s)]
*  want to an accurate range you get that one button press and it'll give you exact range and you know [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5862.36s)]
*  it's based on everything is compensated into the site itself so angle compensation is built into [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5869.24s)]
*  the site itself you put in the speed of your arrow so if you're shooting 285 feet per second [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5875.08s)]
*  exactly it's all factored in to your bow it's pretty incredible i liked that a lot because [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5880.04s)]
*  uh and i think i've heard you even mention this what i what i love about archery is obviously you [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5888.04s)]
*  got these windows everything ain't just sitting out in the yard where you're shooting right [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5892.68s)]
*  shooting through the wood especially if you're out there elk hunting you got these windows and um [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5896.28s)]
*  there was a site years ago that i remember and it worked in theory great but it was simple it [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5900.68s)]
*  wasn't like the range or the the garment but they had these fiber optics that were glued to the [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5905.4800000000005s)]
*  middle of a basically of a piece of glass that went into the site housing so you would buy this [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5911.16s)]
*  glass housing that okay if your bow was 280 feet per second or 290 or 300 320 and your pins were [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5917.88s)]
*  pretty set so you went in and got your top pin dialed in so then you had all these but your site [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5924.04s)]
*  viewing was good the problem was when it rained or if it got dirty foggy yeah and what i did like [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5928.92s)]
*  about that is uh is the fact that the reason i've always liked pins multiple pins is the fact that [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5934.52s)]
*  i could see my whole site picture where my arrows going from 20 all the way out to even if i'm [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5941.96s)]
*  shooting 80 in this case most of my sites i set up from say 20 to 60 or 20 to 70 i try to put as [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5946.4400000000005s)]
*  many pins on my site as i can a lot of people don't like it because they think it's clutter but once [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5952.68s)]
*  i've mentally got used to it if i arrange a bull say 65 when i pull back without having [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5957.08s)]
*  doing any other calculations i put my 60 yard pin on that bull it's in the clear and then quickly [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5963.16s)]
*  now it's like a you know memory of going back and i quickly go back up to my 20 yard pin and i'm [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5969.0s)]
*  looking all the way down through and estimating is this arrow gonna mark through but basically from 20 [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5974.84s)]
*  all the way out to my desired where i want to hit i can see the arc of my arrow based on my pin set [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5980.76s)]
*  good so so you know if there's a gap in the trees i know the gap you're gonna be able to get right [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5986.68s)]
*  in there i know if i'm at 60 holding dead on that clear spot but i got a limb at 30 in my 30 yard [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5990.200000000001s)]
*  pins in the middle of it i know like oh crap i'm gonna hit that so now i can just squat down so [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5995.08s)]
*  that's why i don't like as much a single pin technology and then quickly what i like about [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=5999.320000000001s)]
*  the pins it's clutter it's kind of old-fashioned but i do like that a lot from that standpoint of [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6005.0s)]
*  trajectory of of the ability to to kind of kill or to take and fill a tag and cam and i talked a [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6011.0s)]
*  lot about those things we talked a lot about the release i definitely like that you know i like the [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6019.64s)]
*  handheld from a if i really want to try to hone in and be a little more disciplined and kind of the [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6025.16s)]
*  feel it go not feel it go off and shoot with completely surprise i like that but i don't think [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6030.92s)]
*  that traditionally works is great for hunting because of the fact i think you do have to know [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6036.04s)]
*  and to make that error go right now if you consistently have to even in texas i mean [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6041.64s)]
*  we're shooting animals at you know 20 to 30 yards those deer and um sometimes the opportunities [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6046.92s)]
*  sometimes they walk in they're they're dogging a doe they're coming in every deer ain't coming in [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6053.4s)]
*  just to eat corn or eating a food plot they're coming in they got one thing on their mind and [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6057.24s)]
*  that's you know mama is ready and so they're coming in grunting so that deer runs he stops [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6061.96s)]
*  and you got to be at full draw know he's 27 come back and you got to send it right now you know [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6067.08s)]
*  what i describe it as the difference between practicing free throws and basketball 100 that's [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6071.4800000000005s)]
*  it stefan curry yeah it's not it it is i mean you don't get a chance to set up and have a surprise [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6077.0s)]
*  shot 100 that's a great way yeah that's really what it is i think practicing sure but i think [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6084.12s)]
*  there's moments where you got to make that sucker go off but then oh man yeah there's great hunters [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6090.52s)]
*  like levi morgan who hunts with a hinge oh dude i mean just an animal yeah he's he's probably the [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6095.080000000001s)]
*  most decorated archer that i know i mean that dude maybe of all time yeah because like ulmer [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6101.080000000001s)]
*  gillingham all those guys are heroes of mine i mean like i very much look up to them and if i can ever [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6106.52s)]
*  pull them aside i just wear them out trying to learn you know right and uh but levi is right [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6111.8s)]
*  there dude far as winning and what he knows and he you know another thing about levi i got to give [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6116.84s)]
*  him credit that dude is a cold-blooded killer man he he is a great hunter too sometimes i don't [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6120.76s)]
*  translate i know some people that are great tournament right i mean 3d tournament asa ibo [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6126.04s)]
*  winners right but it doesn't go over into the ability to just free throws free throws versus [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6132.12s)]
*  basketball yeah no doubt is like you're standing weird one leg is down one leg is up you know you're [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6137.88s)]
*  on the side of a hill you got to cant your bow a little bit you know yeah you lean your bubble [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6144.76s)]
*  into the wind there's a lot of shit going on a lot a lot and then you got the nerves you never get [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6149.24s)]
*  completely over that you know people ask me all the time do you ever get nervous or you get buck [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6154.4400000000005s)]
*  fear like man almost every time it's like i think that's when if if some of that yes you get good at [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6158.280000000001s)]
*  kind of somewhat like stage fright i saw a clip of elvis pressley i thought it was so unique i saw [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6165.08s)]
*  a clip of elvis pressley the other day on this youtube clip and he he was completely in panic [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6170.28s)]
*  and this was like right in the prime of his career and he was walking around and and it was a narrator [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6176.36s)]
*  saying yes elvis notoriously would get just afraid every time went on fray and i'm like this is the [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6180.5199999999995s)]
*  king right but but he was just pacing and he was being short with a couple of people i wish i [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6185.08s)]
*  and um in any way he walks out there i'm sure he crushes it but i think it's similar to probably [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6191.4s)]
*  how some of those football players running out on the field there's no way you got all this [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6196.68s)]
*  clicking in your head like oh man i gotta remember bilichek has told me that he's introduced this new [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6200.6s)]

*  places like in podcasts the only places where you can hear it this way and i think uh that's [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6477.32s)]
*  what we're battling against we're battling against the media representations of hunting [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6484.52s)]
*  which is almost entirely negative and these perceptions that people have that hunters are [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6489.24s)]
*  cruel and then then then there's this term trophy trophy yeah like that that's the mule deer that i [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6493.48s)]
*  killed with renalia that's the first say that's that's awesome i love that and you know you could [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6498.839999999999s)]
*  say that this is not a trophy mule deer it's not a very big mule deer as far as mule deers go this is [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6503.799999999999s)]
*  you know a mature buck but he's not a big one oh he's but he's beautiful to me this is this is [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6509.959999999999s)]
*  where it all started and this is a trophy this is not if you went to a trophy unit and you shot a [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6516.12s)]
*  deer like this people like what are you doing why'd you shoot this why didn't you hold out for a big [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6521.64s)]
*  mature one but this is like the term trophy gets thrown around and and unfortunately has a negative [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6525.400000000001s)]
*  connotation but it does i think ted puts it the best way ted nujent yep he says he says it's all [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6532.68s)]
*  the things it's food it's trophy it's sport it's all those things together you know i don't think [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6540.280000000001s)]
*  of it as a sport like you said i think the term sport it's sports are awesome don't get me wrong [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6546.2s)]
*  but it's not significant enough i agree for what hunting is 100 i agree with that you're you're [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6553.72s)]
*  taking a life you're feeding yourself with that life it's more it's more powerful than sport [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6560.68s)]
*  and that's why anymore yeah when you call it this sport of hunting i'm like i don't like that term [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6567.5599999999995s)]
*  i agree with that too as a matter of fact if there's any negative thing i think the hunting [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6572.52s)]
*  industry and even tv shows that we produce can put a negative vibe potentially on trying to kill [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6577.080000000001s)]
*  these big trophy animals don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with it i mean you you're hunting [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6583.88s)]

*  like a human yeah and i said and and sometimes it's almost like uh you know i you know i i've [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6819.4s)]
*  never figured out completely a lady my wife you know i sometimes it's always a game like and i've [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6826.12s)]
*  i've learned that i don't know that i'll ever understand exactly what it is she wants but i [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6831.799999999999s)]
*  know she wants me to hear and pay attention and i think that's what society's doing whether you're [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6836.44s)]
*  a hunter whether you're from the city and but overall what i have found whether you live in [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6840.839999999999s)]
*  the city or the country whether you get a chance to go to a rave or go to the mothership uh which [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6845.72s)]
*  i hope to go by there tonight i just want to check out the joint you know and and so anyway when it's [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6851.4800000000005s)]
*  all said and done there's something about the peace and tranquility that you can refuel out in the [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6855.64s)]
*  woods and it brings everything to a to a focal point and uh and you can be still and be quiet [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6860.04s)]
*  and it brings everything back and so in reality it's not about people going to think of you [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6866.68s)]
*  different if you shoot the biggest high scoring animal that you can put in the bo penyong or the [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6871.72s)]
*  boone and crocket record books i think those of us once we learn to respect each other's uh each [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6875.72s)]
*  other and and love each other's goals that yeah if i know that your goal is to shoot say a 390 bull [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6881.400000000001s)]
*  that one day you know i'll get a call and you're gonna be hyperventilating you're like i just did [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6887.8s)]
*  it like what like dude i swear you know well for people who don't understand why that's so interesting [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6892.84s)]
*  to us it's because they're the most difficult ones to get because they're the older wiser ones [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6899.0s)]
*  that's that's and also yeah when you look at it from a conservation standpoint those are the ones [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6904.04s)]
*  that you want to hunt because those are the ones who spread their genes and they're probably about [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6909.96s)]
*  to get taken out by nature anyway correct if you get an eight-year-old elk or a nine-year-old elk [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6913.8s)]
*  or a 10-year-old elk how many years do they have left i shot one 10-year-old elk once his teeth [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6919.48s)]
*  were worn down to almost nothing just an old tank how much time did he have left if not most likely [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6924.68s)]
*  he was gonna either starve to death or freeze to death or get stabbed in a fight with another elk [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6930.76s)]
*  he'd get stabbed and wind up mountain lion jump on him yeah mountain lion jump on him or [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6935.4800000000005s)]
*  freeze to death or you know a number of other very very cruel endings that mean i shot that elk at [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6939.96s)]
*  40 yards it was a perfect shot he was down in 15 seconds it was no tracking so it's like that elk [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6947.320000000001s)]
*  died the best way yes he did possible yes he did he's not he's not they don't live forever and [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6954.68s)]
*  become angels and that is a very good death compared to a pack of wolves or mountain lions [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6960.84s)]
*  starting to eat on you sometimes before they're even deceased it happens all there's so many [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6968.52s)]
*  videos especially bears oh bears are brutal man oh bears are very brutal and selfish animals man [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6972.280000000001s)]
*  crazy like hunting bears is the thing you get the most hate for oh everybody thinks they're cuddly [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6978.200000000001s)]
*  i mean i don't know if it's a winnie the pooh type of thing 100 but it's like teddy bears and yogi [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6983.24s)]
*  and all that shit we're all distorted like when people say you've hunt bears i go i've eaten bears [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=6988.679999999999s)]

*  you would go what is this this is great it's like it seems like beef but different and then if they [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7003.96s)]
*  knew how a bear's personality was i mean you got to kill them oh they'll kill their own kids [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7009.4s)]
*  oh yeah and eat to breed mama to eat them i mean it's just a it's a brutal world you know i [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7015.16s)]
*  there was things before i even had a chance to hunt that i recognized just domestically you know [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7021.16s)]
*  i'm you know raising rabbits you know you know those rabbits would sometimes kill the little [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7025.0s)]
*  baby rabbits for the right and opportunity to breed again real quick with the with the female [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7031.32s)]
*  in the pen you know and i realized my papa said you got to separate them that buck rabbit killed [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7035.8s)]
*  that man i didn't know that you know i'm 10 11 years old trying to figure out how to raise some [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7040.2s)]
*  rabbits are watching hogs you know uh pigs it always had on a raised floor pen he had had raised [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7043.56s)]
*  up a few hogs man them jokers are trying to kill each other mean you know who does it dolphins [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7049.4800000000005s)]
*  dolphin are they brutal like that dolphins we think of them sweet intelligent they commit [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7054.76s)]
*  infanticide all the time what dolphin females have to do is they have to breed with as many [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7060.04s)]
*  as possible because when a female dolphin has babies she has to take care of that baby for [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7066.04s)]
*  about six years so when the male dolphins recognize a female with babies and they don't know that [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7072.12s)]
*  female those are not his babies yeah he'll kill those babies so that female dolphin will breed [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7078.4400000000005s)]
*  so he wants to breed her so she will breed with everybody possible so nobody knows who the babies [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7083.8s)]
*  are and so since they're intelligent they understand that they've they've bred with that [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7089.240000000001s)]
*  female before so that could be their their babies so they don't kill them so basically all the [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7093.96s)]
*  dolphins are hoes all hoes yeah that's how they have to be that otherwise their babies get killed [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7098.68s)]
*  so they've adopted this polyamorous strategy to try to kill to keep the male dolphins from killing [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7104.76s)]
*  the babies well that's amazing i mean you watch the breeding season during elk like you was talking [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7111.0s)]
*  about fighting and ironically they never they never get things confused those males are looking [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7115.56s)]
*  for the females the females know that i'm gonna breed with this dude and strongest survive and [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7122.76s)]
*  they are you know a lot of people say oh they're really not trying to kill each other no you wasn't [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7127.72s)]
*  out there i didn't watch this on that geo this they're trying to murder each other oh i've seen [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7131.24s)]
*  some amazing epic elk fights it's some of the greatest things to see in nature these big 800 [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7136.52s)]
*  pound animals running at each other with swords growing out of their heads it's yeah it sounds [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7141.72s)]
*  like an old like some kind of scottish fight back right 1400 like a sword fight almost it's like [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7146.84s)]
*  cracking baseball bats together against each other and you hear it loud you're like oh shit [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7154.12s)]
*  they're fighting and it gives you cold chills oh it's amazing it's it's crazy to watch the brutality [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7158.52s)]
*  of it and you know you'll find them occasionally dead yeah because one of them has stabbed one we [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7163.88s)]

*  think it's sad that most people don't know um and there's a lot of very smart people that in some [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7217.56s)]
*  cases they think it might be a little beneath them to to understand what maybe hunting is truly about [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7223.400000000001s)]
*  other than maybe what they see on a walt disney movie and uh i think that is definitely [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7228.92s)]
*  kind of fueled me to be able to help educate and talk about those things and i know renella has [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7235.32s)]
*  done an amazing job of introducing that too and there's a lot of great ambassadors that we got [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7239.08s)]

*  of conversations with renella and with can no doubt yourself and how did you eventually get [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7253.16s)]
*  started doing because like that's every young guy's dream that is ever hunted like oh my god [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=7258.84s)]

*  of good work ethic my dad put in me and i was really had a passion for it and um and i didn't [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8174.36s)]
*  have really any weird opposition pulling me away from it it pulled me toward it but growing up so [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8180.2s)]

*  well it's interesting because fun and personality and camaraderie are infectious it's like people [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8212.68s)]
*  they're drawn to it but it's not something you can manufacture you either have a great personality [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8220.2s)]
*  or you don't but having a great personality is very marketable so it's kind of a weird sort of [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8226.12s)]
*  catch like you can't pretend you're that person because people won't buy it you have to actually [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8232.36s)]
*  for the reason why i work with you is because this is who you really are that's you right and so you [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8237.16s)]
*  didn't even know you had this thing that was marketable i know it was just you being a person [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8243.56s)]
*  it's a great point because to this day i'll go to and aside because i'm now you know when i [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8250.76s)]
*  i know you love classic cars and i hear about the things you talk about and obviously i'm a big fan [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8257.08s)]
*  of of the podcast and so one thing that draws me in is the fact that culturally we're into the same [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8261.56s)]
*  things you know rubik's cubes and 80s and i always my favorite car was a 70 supersport you know cheville [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8266.279999999999s)]
*  and so i have one of those dude i black with white stripes oh my god i love it the same one like on [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8273.24s)]
*  john wick basically yes that's a 70 yeah so anyway i i was just so just amazed by i don't know it's [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8279.08s)]
*  just all of it and and and and even now when i meet people that's the first thing they'll say after [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8288.36s)]
*  we hang out and i just had it up at cactus jack with uh with camera i had two or three of the guys [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8293.16s)]
*  like hey man and these are older guys like appreciate you whatever man you just like [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8298.04s)]
*  i thought you'd be and it kind of takes me back it's not offensive but i'm like [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8302.2s)]
*  what what was i supposed to be and i i guess i realize and camera and i've talked a lot about [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8306.28s)]
*  that about like it's odd that there is a thing that is fake that people can't be transparent [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8311.080000000002s)]
*  that people can't just talk their feelings and everything we say don't mean our assessment is [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8316.6s)]
*  always correct but at least it is something to be heard and told and then the more you talk i think [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8320.92s)]
*  that's what reshaped the politics this year when you look at trump coming on jd yeah harris past [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8326.68s)]
*  well it proves like well did you really have something to say and could it be valid and could [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8333.800000000001s)]
*  you be real and everybody i think appreciates real even if they don't like the person that they see [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8337.800000000001s)]
*  necessarily as as real and now everything's in question it's like you know it's like these [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8344.6s)]
*  they really as tough as they say right is was diddy gay i thought this dude i thought he had [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8350.92s)]
*  done shot more stuff than i have you know and it's like you know i don't know i don't know it's just [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8356.76s)]
*  like it's yeah well when when people ask me all the time like oh you met jelly roll what's he like [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8360.68s)]
*  he's exactly like you the same like that's right that's why he's popular that's a genuine real [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8366.92s)]
*  human being like luke bryan just like you like funny good good cool cat yeah luke combe same [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8373.560000000001s)]
*  thing that's exactly who he is and that's what people are worried about that someone not being [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8379.56s)]
*  like that like you see someone who's real fun on tv and they're real friendly and then you meet [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8384.359999999999s)]
*  him in real life like oh that guy's an asshole he's being the waitresses and you know he's [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8388.359999999999s)]
*  shitty to the fucking the valley driver you know it's you you want people to be what you hope them [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8392.6s)]

*  like you know i remember going to utah and hunting and i was like hey man you know this before i ever [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8405.0s)]
*  knew i'd get a chance to meet you and talk with you and i said how's joe and he's like and then [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8410.28s)]

*  and and a question for you i've often wondered do you think that's starting to affect hollywood a [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8418.84s)]
*  little bit to where now if you look at the most successful people it is the realest people you [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8422.84s)]
*  know people might not even like say a donald trump but people are gravitated because they think hey [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8428.04s)]
*  man this is him this is real uh i think the best thing for people in hollywood that are entrenched [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8431.72s)]
*  in that world is to shut the fuck up because as soon as they start talking people like this is [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8437.96s)]
*  robert de niro starts talking i'm like jesus get that fucking microphone away from him so i can [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8443.08s)]

*  him talking about politics and about trump supporters and just shut the fuck up man yeah [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8457.64s)]
*  like you didn't think this through like this is and he's getting yelled at he's doing an outside [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8463.16s)]
*  press conference like robert you're 80 years old don't ruin this thing you've had this life where [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8467.48s)]

*  you should be i mean like i've met a few of them and it's actors in particular because their whole [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8483.4s)]
*  business is pretend their whole business is pretend you know one of the things about guys [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8489.8s)]
*  like theo or comedians you run into comedians their business is the opposite of pretend [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8494.76s)]
*  they're real their business is just being a real person talking shit yeah they're professional [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8499.56s)]
*  shit talkers yeah you know having fun being silly talking shit about things and actors are not that [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8504.92s)]
*  they're weird people man and the one thing that's harming them in hollywood is that they get exposed [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8512.2s)]
*  for being who they really are and a lot of these people that pretend to be all you know clean cut [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8518.68s)]
*  and yeah find out they're in the freaky shit and you know it's like and it's easier to expose stuff [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8524.12s)]
*  now because social media i'm sure like back in the day i can only imagine the parties at wailin [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8530.28s)]
*  jennings and murrell haggard can you some of these pictures on the wall in here can you imagine some [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8535.320000000002s)]

*  it yeah and now yeah now you can't go on elk cut and everybody knows you're there everybody's kind [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8555.24s)]
*  of fucking camera in their pocket everybody everything is being filmed and so many people [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8559.96s)]
*  get exposed for who they really are it's it's weird but it's also probably good for humanity [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8564.76s)]
*  it's good for let's one of the things that i think is what the rise of podcasts is people get to see [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8569.960000000001s)]
*  real people having real conversations and yeah some people can do it and some people can't and [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8575.4s)]

*  a good assessment that she couldn't i don't know man i mean i've seen her have fun with people [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8585.08s)]

*  first time where her mother-in-law grabs her face and it's really funny it's it's funny listening [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8593.96s)]
*  to her saying she's laughing hard but a real laugh this time maybe she could now though maybe [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8599.48s)]
*  if there is a machine because you know what is it's fair to say uh even on harris i'll say this [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=8605.24s)]

*  transparent legal corruption it's very strange and it's on both sides it happens everywhere if [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=9134.36s)]

*  it's not a right or a left thing it's a power and corruption thing and i feel like there is a little [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=9166.68s)]
*  bit of momentum that feels like there's a little bit of a cleansing process it's gonna take a long [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=9172.6s)]
*  time i think to get there but i think everything that's happening now it feels through opportunities [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3o2PppiJIo&t=9177.72s)]
