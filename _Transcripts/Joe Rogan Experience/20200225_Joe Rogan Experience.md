# Joe Rogan Experience #1431 - Owen Smith
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 25, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1Q4vhC4Ink)
*  Yeah, three two one boom and we're live. Oh, we're talking about yoga. Yeah Simmons
*  Yeah, Russell Simmons. He moved to Bali because he's worried about them extraditing. I don't he's worried but I
*  Is I'm this is all conjecture. This is what I've heard, but I just bought him up because
*  We had a yoga studio here did he yeah, and he gave me a month free a
*  Month free high-end yoga thing like you just show up in your clothes. They give you the mat towels real blocks
*  Everything and everybody was awesome and I went every day for a month and did yoga next to Russell Simmons
*  Wow, and he was like amazing and I was like really feeling it. I felt great and
*  Then all the stuff happened
*  It's so easy to slide away
*  I love that guy did I have a funny story? What do you think is more important than stand-up?
*  To be polished or to be raw
*  There's no more important thing they're they're both very important
*  But Joey Diaz is not polished at all and he's the funniest guy that I've ever seen. Yeah, no one's ever made me laugh harder
*  He's not polished he's raw as fuck
*  But raw alone is not good because some guys like Jessel neck is very polished and he's very funny
*  You're very polished. You're very funny. Yes. There's no there's no one thing, you know, it's like comedy is a art
*  It's an art expression of who you are. If you're a polished person and you try to come off raw, it's gonna look corny
*  so I bought that up because I
*  am I
*  Don't know young 20s deaf jam is having auditions
*  It just moved from New York to LA and Beverly Hills was where they're taping which was ironic in itself and
*  But I was raw
*  You remember those when you go hit it DJ and you have music you like yeah
*  so I auditioned and
*  Bushwick bill
*  Was one of the judges it was like a I auditioned at all jokes aside in Chicago and I got picked
*  I was one of the people to get picked to tape Jeff Chan
*  First time I was ever flown out anywhere first time I ever came to was flown to Los Angeles
*  I'd been here before stayed at the hotel so fatale. Whoa, but what happened is I got picked I was raw
*  About three months went by I went on a tour of North Dakota
*  South Dakota
*  Minneapolis where none of those death jam jokes worked
*  So I
*  Started like getting polished a little bit, right? So when I went to tape death jam I
*  Did it and I got I think seven applause breaks
*  But I didn't get the standing ovation and I remember when I got off stage at one comedian said way to keep them seated
*  And Russell walked right past me like I just wanted him to see me
*  So I knew I wasn't going to air right and I got that was my first you got seven applause
*  Wouldn't air well, I got a note. I got a I got my first rejection letter saying thank you so much
*  But you're you won't be airing the air. They had Rodman near to other people and
*  Then so I felt
*  Like shit, you know, I mean like I was like damn my black enough like the whole black thing
*  Like damn, I'm not a part of death jam. I want to be torn. I make those audiences laugh, but
*  What I auditioned with it was straight from Maryland like straight just raw like all
*  bravado
*  I wasn't talking about anything and I went to these other cities and it was kind of like I was kind of like finding my
*  Style, right? How many years had you been doing it at the time? I was probably doing I started at 19, but I
*  You know, that's the college start and then you but I think I started doing the full time at 22 and I was probably 26
*  So maybe four years
*  Arrogant though, like, you know, if I was your feature act, I I knew always kept a time clock
*  Sometimes I would go long
*  but I would
*  But I was I was very proud of like if they said do 12 I would do 12
*  You know, I mean that kind of thing and I was I was getting standing ovations
*  But I wasn't talking about nothing and then I started like doing these other states and I was like, okay fine
*  Don't get don't get it
*  So my objection I really needed Russell Simmons to like me like, you know
*  I mean he meant so much to the culture and to and he just when he just didn't see me
*  I just was like damn years go by and
*  The the pain of it like diminishes but it's still kind of in there
*  But it's you know, it's like a Marvel villain like you like I gotta
*  you know, I must but it kind of so then Russell has another show and
*  I
*  Didn't even think I was going to get picked
*  My only goal was just to make him laugh because he was he was at the audition and it was in New York
*  I was living in New York. He was there and Stan Latham was there and
*  This is years later. I found I knew who I was. I knew what I was, you know coming to say
*  I didn't know if it was gonna match their show and
*  And what I'm saying is like Def Jam prided itself on raw like being raw
*  You know what I mean? And unlike, you know a new voice and then I
*  Didn't fit like what they were selling, you know
*  So then when I saw Russell was saying I do my act. I see Russell grab his stomach and go over
*  So I'm good if I get to show I get it if I don't get it
*  I'm good. I see Stan Latham go I see them do the whisper
*  I I
*  Literally don't care if I get to show I did what I set out to do, right?
*  So all the other comments are staying back to schmooze and hey man, like I left I left
*  I didn't I ended up getting the show and this is the show now when Russell was sitting in the audience and their comics sitting up
*  there and I'm doing my act and I was I was talking about HBO hung that show about
*  White dude with a big dick for real. That's what we doing like
*  That's what we had now and I did like the stereotype game and all this stuff and and I did one joke and I remember
*  Russell got up and gave me a gave me a pound in the middle of my set
*  It was like a slow motion you can see all the comics like and I was like so it was like the full circle of
*  24 year old me. Yeah, beat it and then
*  30
*  To 34 year old me maybe Russell's like, yo my man and then I would go
*  You know
*  Then I was doing yoga with him for a little bit
*  But we never hung posted it was just like, you know, I was just like I don't know
*  Full circle moment call you and say I'm giving you this month free yoga was a part of doing the show
*  How did that happen? No, he used to be at all deaf all he had he had all deaf digital
*  So he moved here and I think I went there to pitch him something
*  And he just gave me a month free and I was like I'm gonna take it so every morning I would wake up and drive
*  And I didn't always gonna be in his class like Usher Raymond of being there
*  Really incredible. Yeah, like all these people would be in there and I was I sure could fight
*  Yeah, really have you ever seen him train?
*  No, Usher has videos online of him training at black house and he's legit
*  Like he's a legit skilled fighter. I believe it like he's got like real good hands. He can throw kicks everything
*  Yeah, he is probably the Kobe of R&B. Really? I feel like he outworks everybody
*  You know when I saw him in yoga class, I was like who else is doing this like in your field
*  You know like I don't know yoga is something you don't get any credit for doing no
*  This is fucking hard as shit, but it seems like no big deal
*  Like if you say I ran seven miles today people are whoa. Yeah, I did yoga today
*  Some old ladies
*  But it's real but I
*  Felt so good when I was doing it and I I don't think I didn't tell anybody I was doing
*  Like my wife knew I was going. Yeah, but it is it's a personal thing. It's like golf, right?
*  It's the personal it's just you against your body and Russell you give me tips
*  You know, it's about breathing in difficult situations. He would always say that I never forgot that. Mm-hmm. It is about breathing
*  Yeah, yeah, it's about breathing. That's what life is like
*  Life is going to give you difficult situations and if you don't remember to breathe fur you're fucked
*  Yeah, not like the whole the premise of it. Well, I feel like we operate on a scale and
*  The least difficulty you have in your life the more difficult it is to encounter real adversity
*  So when you give yourself
*  voluntary difficulty
*  So I volunteer to work out hard. I volunteer to do jiu-jitsu. I volunteer to do yoga
*  I've pushed myself to do these things when actual real-life difficulties come along like they're hard
*  But there's never a time in life where it's as hard as a 90-minute yoga class
*  Wow, you're sweating like crazy. You barely can stand up
*  You're trying your feet are cramping your legs tramping pouring sweat pouring down on the mats
*  But I mean it's temporary, you know, it's gonna end in 40 50 seconds
*  But that
*  Just hang in there is so hard that I think it prepares you for other things other than like the loss of a loved one
*  Or something like that. That's impossible to prepare yourself for but just bullshit stress
*  Right just regular life bullshit stress yoga class makes that stuff look like nonsense if you're doing yoga on a regular basis
*  Yeah, well, I it was something I'm consistently inconsistent
*  You know what I mean, but I'll go through a phase so before the Russell thing I went to a hot big room
*  Yeah, that's what I do. So I went to a hot big room and this is when I was single
*  so I was basically just following the asses like
*  Go into there and
*  Yeah, I remember it was a big room and everything was chilling, you know, I literally had never done this at all
*  I was literally just you know, I don't know why I don't know why and I just remember they closed all the
*  Windows and they stopped the fans and it started getting really hot and I was doing the poses and I was shaking and like you said
*  I sweating profusely and
*  The only thing I knew was it was supposed to be a place of no judgment they kept going it's it's your journey
*  It's yoga practice. No judgment. The lady had the little mic thing and she came over to me and she covered it and she whispered to me
*  I
*  Couldn't and so I
*  Didn't really go back after that. My ego was bruised a little bit and so I would do it at home
*  sometimes
*  preparing to go back
*  Try to practice yoga son
*  So I could not get judged and when I left like she was like the teacher was like on the cover of the magazine in front
*  I was like damn like she would just yeah, and so but why she did it was so funny. She's like
*  Like
*  Off of these girls man, and it's terrible
*  It's fucking hard man in the reason why they ask you if you are right because sometimes people are not alright
*  Yeah, like I've seen people almost black out where they have to lay down
*  Oh, yeah
*  Cuz it's 105 degrees in there and if you're not used to that kind of exercise in that kind of temperature if you have you know
*  A per if you're one of those people that just that stuff gets to you and you can handle yeah
*  You can legitimately pass out it'll need that I remember remember valleys Jim. Yeah, I remember. Yeah, I used to live on
*  The valleys at the bottom of the hill and I belong to valleys, you know, and I would go, you know
*  I went through a period
*  I'm going when it opens and so I went I think it opened at six. Maybe damn you're a six o'clock in the morning guy
*  I did that for a minute
*  Get there. So line outside. How come we can't go in in this lady
*  Somebody's dead in the pool
*  It was a dead body like floating in in the valleys. Whoa, and then I never forget this other lady goes
*  He got out his contract
*  Torius for not letting you out. Yeah, he's he got his contract and then everybody still waiting
*  Well 24-hour fitness is the weirdest one they'll sign up for like 10 years for like a dollar a week
*  They don't give a fuck. They know you're not coming right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we're helping you with your goals. Yeah
*  Yeah, you're gonna get fit. You're gonna get jacked. We're gonna get ripped like Bobby over here. Look at Bobby
*  Bobby shows up every day. Yeah, I'm gonna be like Bobby and then you just started eating chips
*  Yeah, drinking soda never show up. It's a I wonder like what are the percentage?
*  Find this what are the percentages of members in 24 hours 24 hour fitness that actually go on a regular basis
*  That's a great share that they wouldn't share it. You're probably right. Yeah, cuz then people go why am I signing up for that?
*  Yeah, yeah
*  That's a great hustle man
*  I did I had a 24 hour fitness for a moment and then I would go and it would be so crowded
*  I would just go home. Sometimes it's real crowd. Yeah, I can't even yeah
*  I can't even do anything then some of them like you couldn't use all of them to you. Oh, you don't have that
*  What are you talking about? It's like that too. Oh, I did equinox for a second. Yeah, this is a 24 hour club sport
*  Yeah, like what? Yeah, I did equal nice for a second. I got to play basketball
*  Magic really? Yeah, he was in there working out every morning Wow on our Cineo, too
*  So he'd so you just play a pickup game with people
*  No, I didn't he would he would shoot around and I just kind of like made myself like available on the court
*  I'm just there when the ball went through the rim. I went and got the rebound. I gave it to him
*  He shot another one. I got the rebound
*  Always want to rebound for you
*  Then I gave him a pass and he did the classic hook and he goes and now you got an assist
*  So and then because a lot of basketball players would come up there and I'll look at him like man
*  I'm glad I couldn't magic is huge man. Like yeah, have you seen him in person? No
*  Huge and I'm 6'5. So but his back is like I
*  like I had hoop dreams until I played against Grand Hill in
*  high school
*  Grand Hill is 6'9 and it was a Christmas tournament and my mom was there and my girlfriend at the time
*  shout out to
*  My girlfriend was there and I
*  Had a rah-rah section, you know, we were the home team and Grand Hill comes in and my coach had me check him
*  and I never I
*  Guarantee you he won't remember this but
*  It's this thing called the crossover right and most people if you cross over
*  I'm I'm still in front of you grant was so long when he did put the ball from this hand to this hand. I
*  I
*  Had to literally slide two steps and then when he boom back I had to slide back two steps and when he went up
*  Here there was no way I could get up there. And so I told my girlfriend go home like
*  It's going like 60 points
*  He was shooting from half court. Like he just looked at us like I was like
*  I'm a
*  Do well in school. That's a fascinating thing when you see someone who's a world-class athlete the beginning of their journey
*  You know, this is in high school high school. Yeah, I was getting to their journey
*  Yeah, right cuz he's really just getting becoming a man. Yeah, he's not even really a man yet
*  No, but you see already like they have that jump. I'm sure Jordan was like that
*  I'm sure well, this wasn't Jordan like didn't make his high school team. Yeah, and that crazy. Yeah, who cut him?
*  Yeah, you know that coach had to when he went home that night had to talk to his wife
*  I think I made a terrible mistake
*  But he probably didn't realize it because the time Jordan probably well Jordan is not the biggest guy in the world either right?
*  How tall is he? Is he 6'4"? He's 6'6". 6'6". 6'6". But compared to some of those giants like when they're standing like Shaq is the most ridiculous
*  Human being I've ever met. He's incredibly tall. His hands are as big as his table. Yeah, they just reach out
*  Yeah, and just swallow your arm. Yeah, so big. He lives in my neighborhood. A word? Yeah
*  I did a commercial with him. It never aired. We did like a series of spots and
*  He was like a big kid man. He was so fun. He's a fun guy
*  I did so with him you did he did a whole episode
*  He came in because we did it in Orlando. Yeah, he was a fan. So he brought his whole family down
*  He had a bus he brought a tour bus to hang out in so fun
*  And then he you know, he did the thing three two one go
*  I'm standing next to him like a little six-year-old with my dad. It's hilarious
*  Yeah, but yeah, there's there's people that are just they're different man
*  They're just different level athletes and I bet Jordan as good as he was, you know
*  It probably he needed that rejection to turn that burner on. Yeah to make him Jordan. Yeah, the real Jordan
*  Yeah, yeah, and that's always gonna be a story that he was cut from his high school basketball team
*  Yeah, I think he bought it up in his Hall of Fame. I think so too
*  The Hall of Fame speech when he kept shitting on all those all the writers
*  You remembered all of them all over probably your Michael Jordan. Why even bringing these guys up? Nobody even cares. Let it go
*  But that's why he's so great. Yeah that burning fire
*  They would say that if you beat him a pool, he would hate you for two weeks till he play you again
*  Amazing he used to have a pool tournament that he would do in Chicago every year and it was for charity
*  So you'd have all these celebrities come and play pool with them, but you know, he wasn't a good pool player
*  He was like, it was okay, but there's like real pool players out there. They'll fuck you up
*  I use it up and if he got beat he would be furious apparently
*  Handle it but that's the case with everyone who's great at something. They don't want to lose it shit
*  They don't want to lose it backgammon par cheesy. Yeah, you know, is that healthy at a certain point? Oh
*  Yo Mike turn that off it's so unhealthy. Yeah, it's so unhealthy, but that's what makes them great. It's like
*  There's there's a pro and a con to everything, you know
*  I have the same that I've always said that greatness and madness are next-door neighbors and they borrow each other's sugar
*  You can't be great unless you're a little crazy
*  and if you can't be the best ever unless you're out of your fucking mind and Jordan's clear when you see him in that that
*  prep that
*  That speech when he's talking about the Hall of Fame when he's talking about getting inducted and all the people that are wrong all
*  People he's angry still. I mean, he's a crazy person. This is the one of your great highlights as
*  Recognized the greatest basketball player of all time think about how many people have played basketball
*  Millions of people all over this country and millions of people around the world. There's one guy
*  Everybody says who's the greatest basketball player? It's Michael motherfucking Jordan, right?
*  I mean you've got your other people you got your dissenters who say well, I think LeBron
*  Theory with that I have a theory about that. So here's my thing. I feel like that's the wrong narrative
*  I feel like
*  So here's my friend and I we were talking about what is
*  Greatness right greatness is clearly the numbers and accolades and the winds but greatness is also
*  Being able to overcome
*  Great difficulty and still perform. All right, and so adding that into the formula. I feel like
*  Everyone that's a part of the conversation
*  LeBron is the only one who never met his dad
*  Like Jordan knew his dad Kobe rest in peace his dad played in the NBA
*  Magic knew his dad Kareem knew his dad. It's a thing, you know LeBron
*  tallest dude in Akron
*  Walking around every day
*  You see another tall dude. He had to be like dad, you know
*  Just mentally right it like who taught him the game like Jordan had these great teachers and all that so I feel like
*  the question should be
*  Michael Jordan is clearly the greatest of all time with two parents, but with one parent
*  LeBron is the greatest and Kevin Durant is like a
*  Coming interesting way of looking at it just because you is different starting line
*  But there's so many different variables that take place in your life from birth to death
*  To just isolate one factor like not having a father
*  well, but I mean it's like
*  all of
*  Jordan talked about when he got cut from his team. His dad was the one who pushed him. He was his greatest
*  Motivated like he had that like who was doing that for?
*  LeBron LeBron who taught him the game like Jordan went to NC State where Dean Smith was one of the greatest
*  You know
*  Everyone talks about Jordans fundamentals where did LeBron learn this from? Who was teaching them this stuff and if and
*  So it's it's just a different
*  Space and it's like I relate to LeBron because I was raised by a single mom
*  So I recognize myself more in him than in
*  Jordan. It's a very you know
*  nuanced thing
*  But I feel like when people go who's the greatest I'm like man, I do have two parents like
*  It's like if you
*  Motivation the thing about having two parents versus one is there's something about having one parent that gives you this insane
*  Motivation to drive this drive to succeed. That's a that's a factor in a lot of people
*  There was a factor in me. Yeah growing up because I didn't grow up with my dad
*  Yeah, no, you're not knowing my dad talked to my dad saw seven years old
*  Okay, so that and the fact that I knew him until I was six and then didn't talk to him for the rest of my life
*  Yeah, that fuck with me. Yeah, and that there's a part of that
*  Yeah, there's a part of that that would make you like I'll show you motherfuckers. Like you guys don't think I'm worth anything
*  I'll show you yeah
*  Like there's something that like Mike Tyson had that like a lot of people had that a lot of a lot of great athletes had
*  Terrible up rings and it's almost a positive factor, right?
*  You know, you could say that Jordans dad was a positive factor and that that would that can work as well
*  But also sometimes it could be a positive factor to be ignored having a difficult childhood can actually be a positive fact
*  Oh definitely. I mean look LeBron's a billionaire. It clearly was a positive fact how it worked out
*  Definitely it worked out. I'm just saying in the debate. I know what you're saying. Who's the greatest? Yeah, I know
*  It could there's two different ways that could go
*  Yeah, but it's also like they're playing in different eras
*  That's a that's a like did you see the Tyson Fury Deontay Wilder fight? I saw clips. Oh my gosh. Were you there?
*  No, no, I watched it at home. Holy shit. How big is theory though?
*  Fury six seven almost no six nine Deontay six seven Fury six nine six nine
*  270 pounds and
*  He just figured he said he figured out in the first fight that Deontay in the 12th round
*  He started back at Deontay up Deontay can't fight backing up because Deontay is a guy who pushes forward
*  And he's got this ridiculous power right and everybody's scared of his power
*  So everybody's moving all the time and Fury realized in the 12th round after Deontay knocked him down almost knocked him out
*  He got up and started chasing Deontay and Deontay fought
*  Sloppy he said he looked awkward. He said his footwork didn't look so good technique. Yeah
*  Well, it's Deontay is known as being this guy who's got an eraser his right hands like an eraser all the mistakes Teddy
*  Atlas put it this way all the mistakes of the previous rounds all get erased with one punch
*  He just shuts people's lights out and he has that confidence that he has that eraser power
*  But with Tyson Fury realized like look
*  Tyson doesn't fight that way Tyson Fury fights on his toes
*  he sticks and moves you do a lot of head movement and a lot of a lot of like
*  Shucking and jiving and it makes it very difficult for you to figure out what he's doing
*  Like is he going here is he going there? Is he moving is he jabbing?
*  He'll come at you like this with two three fake jabs then a jab at a right hand
*  I'll throw a right hand to the body then I'll throw a left uppercut
*  I'll step to the side of you throw a right hand. He'll move out of the way
*  I'll pop you with a jab as he's moving away. He's like a very
*  technical like really
*  Sophisticated boxer if you look at the movement that he does for someone as big as him
*  It's really kind of crazy and it's not that he couldn't step forward and smash people and knock people out
*  It's just he knows the sweet science. Yes, you know, he knows the sweet science, but then he realized for this fight
*  He had to fight a different way to shock Deontay
*  He had to come at Deontay full blast get in his face from the from the jump and that's exactly what he did
*  He also trained change trainers and he went with Sugar Hill
*  Who's a cronk trainer crock is where Tommy Hearns came from, you know, Gerald McClellan some of the great
*  Like knockout artists of the past and cronk Jim from Emanuel Stewart was known as being a very offensive
*  Style of fighting they have heavy jabs. They don't touch you with the jab
*  They're smashing with the jab big power in the right hand like cronk was a
*  attacking
*  Aggressive style like they were all known like they would wear those cronk shorts those yellow golden shorts
*  You saw a guy with cronk shorts on that motherfucker came to kill you they fought in when they were in the gym
*  Emanuel Stewart would turn the heat up to 100 degrees
*  So when they were doing they were doing like hot yoga in in the fucking cronk gym because he wanted to build up
*  Endurance in these guys so when you would go into the cronk gym in Detroit
*  It was hot as fuck like really hot and that's how we force everybody to train under extreme duress
*  He was a amazing amazing training
*  He's the guy who were rejuvenated Vladimir Klitschko when Vladimir Klitschko was falling apart because he had gotten KO'd a few times
*  He his style just he didn't have like an American style
*  He had this like sort of straight-up European style and Emanuel Stewart just shifted his style and and just made him
*  Concentrate on utilizing that long reach and the big power that long jab
*  So when Tyson Fury went with a cronk trainer for this like he he was dead serious
*  He was going for seek and destroy he told everybody that's what he was gonna do too
*  But nobody believed him everybody thought it was just a hustle like him saying I'm gonna knock out Deontay Wilder
*  I'm gonna come after him. I'm gonna knock him out in two rounds everybody's like you're out of your fucking mind even Deontay was like
*  You don't believe a word you're saying you're just talking you're not gonna try to knock me out
*  That's exactly figured out the puzzle you figured out the puzzle in the 12th round of the first fight
*  He just realized when he had him backing up. He's like oh this guy stumbles on his feet
*  He gets all awkward and you got him backing up. Yeah, so he just just stuck to him like glue
*  He took that L. That's what I wanted to talk to you about
*  I want to start fighting man. No
*  My son needs to know I
*  Want to talk to you about first I want to thank you because you've been very kind
*  About just promoting my stand-up on this platform. Oh, you're welcome, dude. I'm a huge fan

*  You should be filling arenas. So so this is what I'm doing
*  I made something and I want to give it to your viewers so they can watch it and judge for themselves
*  If they just go to text Owen calm text Owen calm

*  You don't understand the the
*  Your your your kind words how it's affect affected my life in a great way
*  If I felt like
*  Vladimir Klitschko, basically it's as far as like comedy is concerned and then when you were like, dude, you're saying I'm like
*  Well, it doesn't it doesn't make sense to me. I know great comics, you know
*  Most comics when they get to your your level they're famous they're famous for being really great comics
*  Well, I see you on stage like I was watching the last time we worked together
*  And I forget who I was standing in the back of the room talking to but I was like this doesn't even make any sense
*  I mean, he's so good. He should be headline in arenas. Yeah, it's true
*  It's like your comedy is so polished and so and I was talking to Tony about it
*  Tony Hinchcliffe we were in the back watching once I was like look how
*  Economy of words like you use just the right amount of words
*  Like you have to fill in the blank you make people fill in the blank sometimes and it makes things even funnier
*  Like that's that's all black belt shit, man
*  It's like you just spent so much time writing, you know in writing for sitcoms and writing for movies
*  And I know it's been very lucrative for you and it's it's great. And you know, you're a great writer
*  There's no question about it, but you're a world-class stand-up. Thank you, man. Thank you
*  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Everybody go to text own.com
*  Cuz I'm serious man, because it's like
*  You know how the business changed, you know, I thought that if you just had quality work that you know
*  It would and then it's it's it's just changed to something that I TV shit all went away. It all went away. Yeah, so
*  So we'll see we'll see I'm putting myself out there
*  Well, you got to get a special that's all it's yeah take for you
*  Someone's gonna step up. Yeah, that would be great, you know
*  That's so we'll see but I just wanted I wanted to thank you and my pleasure. See what happens. Hopefully. Yeah break my phone
*  Yeah, I want to experience that
*  Cuz Comedy Central is I mean Comedy Central is great. I owe them a debt of gratitude
*  They put my special out in 2014 and 2009. Yeah, but the reality is it's like it's just not
*  Same anymore people aren't watching it like they used to watch it. Yeah, they lost the public trust somewhere
*  Yeah, well, they put out a lot of bullshit shows. Yeah, you know, yeah, there's they're they're micromanaging things
*  There's a lot of people that are scared of anything controversial
*  Yeah, somebody told me they fired a lot of people over there, but you know, you hear that and we'll see we'll see what's happening
*  They pass on Kyle Dunnigan show Kyle Dunnigan funny
*  He that fucking shit that he does with face swap is the funniest shit on Instagram
*  He's the funniest man on Instagram. There's a lot of funny shit on the ground
*  But his shit clear like makes me cry. I cry sometimes watching this stuff
*  Yeah, he's he's a talented
*  Creative guy and the fact that they didn't pick that show up
*  But I knew they were fucking it up already because he showed me this one clip
*  It was Caitlyn, you know, he does everything with face swaps, right?
*  He had Caitlyn Jenner on top of Donald Trump fucking Donald Trump and it was
*  Hilarious man. He shows it to me in the back room of the main room. I'm crying tears are coming down my eyes
*  We're laughing so hard he goes and get this Comedy Central passed on that I go what I know
*  He said they said we can't do that one. They said we have we can't do that one. It's too controversial. I go controversial
*  That's what you do. Right? Everything you do is controversial, but it's us. It's so obvious that it's fake
*  It's funny because it's fake. It's like South Park
*  Like you fucking dummies. What is your most successful show South Park? What is what does that show do? They don't give a fuck
*  They go all out. Yeah South Park has no boundaries and it's one of the reasons why it's the greatest comp
*  It's the greatest comedy show ever. Yeah, man you
*  that's the thing that the that's the thing about creating and
*  depending on invisible people to
*  Yeah, prove it or get it because yeah, you don't know where the nose coming from right?
*  Like what you just said is an impassioned argument if you could sit down with the the decision-maker and go and just talk about it
*  Yes, maybe his show would have gone but you like you don't know who anybody is you write it
*  You know, you just go this is good, you know
*  And it's so hard because there's the people that are watching it and then judging whether or not they're gonna put it on television
*  First of all, they're not creative people if they were they would be doing what you're doing. Yeah, they're executives
*  Yeah, and they think they're smart. They think they understand comedy and they also don't want to get fired
*  They don't also don't want to get in trouble. They also want to sell ads. There's so much fuckery going on
*  You know what? I wish I knew I wish I knew
*  What their man they call it mandates like what their mandates are or what they're dealing with
*  Just so that
*  Because you get excited about something and you push and you go this is what I want to do and it is
*  Sometimes you go. Oh man. I don't think they're considering the actual audience
*  No, so I don't but I you know, I don't know what they're
*  Considering, you know and it can drive you crazy
*  It can drive you crazy
*  They're also seriously worried about woke culture
*  They want to make sure like I've had friends they want to pitch things and like where's the diversity, you know
*  You know, we need a trans biracial woman in this we needed this we needed that like hey just concentrate on making it good
*  Make it great. Just make it good. You know, I think your diversity should be everybody who's good fine people are good
*  Don't exclude them because they're gay or trans or whatever
*  But don't include them because they are if they're not talented just because that's not good you just need good
*  You know
*  It would be nice if it was easy for all those people of all different backgrounds to get up in stand-up comedy clubs
*  And then get their career going and I don't know
*  Any situation? I mean, I'm so far removed from open mics. It's a hard for me
*  We should do what?
*  Hey, whatever happened that thing we did were you with the
*  Yeah
*  That was hilarious. I found though dude. It was great. It was great
*  I was I was thinking of giving that to people when they text Owen calm. So I shot
*  six edit four and
*  Took it around town
*  A lot of people didn't get it a lot of knows the the people who loved it the most was all things comedy
*  And they were like we want to you know, take this out
*  But I was partnered with somebody at the time
*  I had a manager at the time that they didn't connect with so it kind of went away and
*  Why we were just talking about this like this should be on TV like it's such a clean simple fun idea
*  Well, it should be on YouTube. It should be yeah
*  But that's my initial plan my initial plan was to put it on YouTube. Why don't you put on YouTube now?
*  um, I don't know I just
*  Did somebody else own it? No, it's all me. It's all me. Oh my IP and all right
*  I put on YouTube when you uh, were you like supported or?
*  I don't know how that stuff works
*  You like a genius back there like why is he you understand man? I'm so afraid of uh
*  I'm not afraid of no, I just got to get the first gut punch and then I'll keep going you understand
*  I'm saying like something weird happened man
*  my younger self
*  Everything people are doing on Instagram. I did when I was 18 19 20
*  Then you get a little bit older. You're like
*  What's this take what's going on? But when I when I when this is about tick-tock. Yes
*  So when this idea came to me I thought I can't think of it. I think his name is chase Jarvis
*  I was looking at chase Jarvis. I never heard of this guy, but I used to watch his his interviews and he was always sponsored by
*  You know something very cool. He's a photographer and
*  He had his own show. We shot it like in his home and he would only average like 50,000 views
*  I'm like, how is this guy doing this? But I thought notebooks could be something like that that would speak to
*  Comedy fans, but my whole intention was to because I felt like
*  Stand-up was being like homogenized like because when you would just do some of these shows the set was built and you would just stand
*  There and perform but it was no way of an audience member to go. I want to
*  Follow this guy. I want to come see see this woman of this guy live. So I thought notebooks
*  The show we're talking about is called notebooks and it's basically
*  Every comic the one thing comics never throw away is the old notebooks
*  So I would sit I sat down with Joe I sat down with some other comics
*  I couldn't believe I found those fun, man
*  And you I was what you gotta see that you watch Joe go back to where he was when he was like performing it
*  I could see it on your face
*  I could see you like remember like where you wrote this stuff where you came up with it and it's just I don't know
*  It just shows that this isn't like we make it look easy, but it's like it shows the journey
*  It's also like a way of like appreciating
*  Like because sometimes we're hard on ourselves. It's like damn man, you know what I mean?
*  Like and there's funny stories. We like I thought this bit was gonna make me
*  This was gonna shut it down. This was my bring the pain, you know
*  Because I can listen to a comedian and tell how long they've been doing it, you know
*  And I wanted to I got to this place where I don't believe anybody
*  Sucks I just believe they haven't found it yet, and I'm interested in my time. There's some people that
*  Yeah, it doesn't matter this is a reality of there's a reality yeah, there's a reality
*  Yeah, but I mean we became we got into this space where now
*  You're what people post everything online?
*  So you're watching them like I have videos of me in San Antonio, Texas in 1996
*  Not great, but it's on a VHS tape in my basement
*  You know what I mean? We're watching you grow right people. Yeah, but now that would be on YouTube
*  And people will be like so when I did hit some people like I can't stand on from something they saw
*  Jokes were funny and did them, you know, but you can't worry about that though. Yeah. Yeah, that's you just got to worry about what you're doing
*  Right now. Yes, I'm never worried about what you did. All right, I'm gonna put it on notebook. I'm putting notebooks out
*  Yeah, and do we found I found some shit from 1991 right? It was that was a crazy
*  The writing was so bad
*  But it just hadn't read it it's not I knew I had it so I grabbed it and I brought it to you
*  Yeah, but I hadn't looked at it before you and I were sitting there. I mean, that's the point
*  Yeah, so when I was going through it was like, oh my god, this is so bad
*  Yeah, the thinking about like my 23 year old self writing jokes. It's the best and sometimes you find a gem
*  We go damn that might be yeah
*  Yeah, you know some bitch you bailed on we're like you're so you're like you're you're it now
*  So, you know, I know how to make this work, right? You can have a you know, we had some people, you know
*  Connect with that and what I love about is this comics aren't burning material, right? So I feel like everyone
*  Can can do the show
*  I mean I prefer to have somebody that's you know gotten their 10,000 hours in yes
*  And so we can have like, you know those stories and it's just an interesting way in
*  Mm-hmm. I loved it. I loved it so much. But my initial my point is I was like, I want to do this for YouTube
*  But then I was like maybe is it maybe there's a televised play for this and three years later
*  Yeah, I think nothing is worth bringing to TV anymore. Yeah, it's just not worth it anymore
*  Just you you're gonna deal with too many people. You don't need to deal with them
*  Yeah, they're not gonna have good things half the people and this is generous
*  half the people that you deal with that are executives really don't give a fuck about anything other than their mortgage or their car or
*  their career or
*  Getting respect or office politics or they they might be working at Comedy Central
*  They could easily be working at the History Channel or easily working at some other fucking network
*  TV network here I am trying to create a platform for some of my friends who are like I feel like why don't you have a following?
*  You know me. Yeah, and I'm like if people just saw your work ethic like how you write your job
*  People be like I like, you know, I'd like you now. I understand what this is
*  Yeah
*  and I felt that that's what was missing from all these specials where people just stand in a spot and they and
*  It's the same background. They just changed the name
*  No, you know no shade on that but it's like very few people were popping off that and
*  So much so people thought I had one of those like that's a you'd ever tell you my my my Comedy Central story
*  No, so, okay
*  So I'm a name check some people on here, but I literally I but I'm not doing it for
*  It's all good like I learned a lot from this experience so George Carlin was performing at most of each comedy and magic club
*  I go down and watch George Carlin performance was this would be his last special at the time
*  Kimber Rickenball who did was Rick Mill productions. She comes over to me and she goes why don't we have a half hour on you?
*  I don't know. She gives me her card and she says give me 21 minutes and
*  You know, we'll make it happen or she alluded to that it would happen
*  And so I'm standing next to the guy who books her most beats like oh, yo, can I get 21 minutes? He's like no
*  I
*  Can just give you seven eight minutes
*  So I had to do like three seven minutes and pieces together. I went to the improv can I get 21 minutes?
*  I went to the lab factor can get 20 minutes. I got this car to no one would give me 21 minutes
*  And so I had to go out of town
*  I think I went to Chicago somewhere taped it got it back at the time. I'm writing on
*  Everybody hates Chris
*  I
*  Dave Becky and Michael Rotenberg met were
*  Managed Chris Rock at the time and they would and they were also producers on the show
*  So they would come down once a month and sit in the video village and just you know
*  You know, and so I was politicking I go man if I can get Dave Becky to contact Kimber Rickenball
*  Maybe I can get with three yards because I had no manager and three yards sexy
*  You know management name and so
*  Ali Leroy the showrunner was also managed by three yards. He was kind enough
*  He was just like he just did like just a day. Yo man, listen this motherfucker and then just kept like
*  So I was like Dave, mr. Becky. What's up, man?
*  Kimber Rickenball gave me the car said if I can give her 21 minutes, you know, it's
*  Probable I'll get a half-hour special
*  I was wondering if I could do that through you and now he goes say no more. I rep Kimber Rickenball done
*  So at that time I was I booked a lot of colleges some I am on cloud nine
*  Oh, you know, I'm about to get a half-hour special. Whoo
*  I had a I did a car had a gig for a college
*  That night so I catch the red-eye to Iowa, right?
*  Ames, Iowa performing in Ames, Iowa get to the hotel room the next morning phone call on my cell phones Dave Becky
*  I'm corny. I go. Help is this give me the start of us doing this a lot, you know
*  Yeah, oh and talk to Kimber and she said she never heard of you
*  It was it I was like what I thought I was like you hazing me right
*  No, sorry, man. Good luck, man. All right, talk to you boop hung up and I was like what and
*  It never dawned to me to call Kimber and be like hey like I was so
*  floored by that
*  Yeah, it was like a gut punch and then check this out I show up at the college I
*  Didn't have a college gig the contract wasn't finalized. So I
*  Lost money a car hotel that I had to drag my dumb tail back to LA
*  No special in Iraq. And again, I didn't ever contacted her. I didn't even know like
*  And that's why I said I could say her name because I never did that part right so like
*  Maybe I could have called him and hey, she'd been oh my god, so sorry
*  I didn't even think that I went into I was having like a pity party on the set of everybody's Chris Ernest Thomas tells me
*  Man, don't wait on Hollywood to give you permission to be great. And that's why I shot my first special
*  I took all my college money shot did all that and said just calling this woman like hey
*  And so that's how I ended up like shooting the first special anonymous that is so crazy
*  She said she didn't even know you
*  But meanwhile you had her card had it and didn't use it. That's why it's like it's not it's not I don't feel like it's
*  Shade on her. It's like I'm talking about and
*  If there's any comments this and like yo call them like, you know, I mean like I'm just
*  Sometimes it's part of that world and not being all in and stand up and being in that writing world. Yeah, that's true
*  Yeah, that's Ian too. Yeah, Ian Edwards. I've been saying the same shit to him forever
*  Stop taking those jobs man, you're too good. You're too good. Yeah, man. Yeah and Ian Edwards and I we started out together man
*  I've known Ian for 20
*  27 28 years I'm not him forever
*  Dude forever Ian and I used to Boston comedy in New York City in the village. Yeah. Yeah
*  I'm a dreadlocking day dreadlocking. I remember I'd seen him on death to him when he's the yell
*  Yeah, before he went vegan. He used to yell he'd calm down
*  Yeah
*  Angry
*  And um, I remember I saw him and he was the coolest to me I I was like, yo man you comedian I'm a comedian
*  He's like, oh
*  What you doing now and nothing come come with me and he took me to like a general meeting
*  That he had and then we went to two sets and I never forget
*  I never forget he we perform he performed in like a white room
*  It was crushing and I said to him. Hey man, that was amazing
*  Was great ago. I didn't trust them
*  Laughing wait trust that
*  You know, I never heard that before I never heard the
*  He was so kind to me
*  that is like
*  Just showing that generosity in a space where he didn't have to be happy with me
*  You know if I man, he's a classic human. Yes. Yeah, I love him. I love that dude to death
*  I always take pictures of him every time he falls asleep cuz you know, he's vegan. So he's tired
*  No, we're gonna play together and I don't mean this dog vegans out there that eating well, right? He does not
*  He just eats vegan, but that means like all it is is a piece of bread. He did a piece of bread
*  He'll eat some rice. He's not it doesn't get all his nutrients. He just doesn't you know, he doesn't exercise either
*  But whenever we're on a plane that motherfucker passes out
*  So I take all these pictures of him every time we go on the road together
*  It's never next to go to me every time he passes out like we're on the runway. This dude is nodding out always
*  Then he got me. He got me recently. He got me he caught it. It's just giant smile
*  I've never seen him smile that well, you see the video of it. There's a video of it on Instagram
*  He got me and he's just got this huge smile and I'm out cold and he's sitting next to me
*  And now every time I fly with him, I'm scared of blacking out. I'm scared of falling asleep
*  He's gonna get a video of you. That's hilarious. I woke up like he was asleep
*  I woke up next to me and he was asleep and I was asleep and I wonder if he's filming while
*  I was asleep before he went to sleep
*  That's the funny shit like spy versus spy shit. Yeah. Yeah. Hello Joe. Yeah, dude the video of him
*  Hovering over me while I'm out cold. I gotta see I never laughed so hard
*  I landed and I checked my Instagram and I saw that I just started fucking howling man
*  It's so funny. I wish you could we one time I was giving him like smoothie recipes because he was like asking about that stuff and
*  Ian is like incredibly frugal. It's so funny. I was like, alright
*  So what you wanna do is you wanna you know, you take strawberry banana
*  You take a protein you could say, you know that it added you want some green stuff to he goes or I could just eat a banana
*  Yeah, I mean but that's kind of like defeating the purpose you want to you know, it's really
*  and so
*  I think he's doing smooths and stuff now, but back then I just remember I
*  Say, huh? Like I just gave you this whole recipe. I could just eat a banana and it's cheaper
*  You know that was a cheaper. That's what it is. I think that was I don't know but I was like protein powder in his life
*  So funny, man
*  So, yeah
*  So I grew up in in Prince George's County, Maryland, right and a lot of comedians
*  Come from there
*  Chappelle I was a pair of a great Chappelle story because we're the same age
*  So when I was 19, I just started
*  Greenbelt comedy connection
*  What I loved about Chappelle I'm bringing this up because it's Mark Twain
*  Awards he gave a shout out to a guy named Tony Woods
*  so Tony Woods is also from the DC area and
*  So at 19, I'm in this comedy club Greenbelt comes a black room
*  Chappelle is on stage and he's getting booed and
*  His dismount off getting booed is something I've never seen before in my life. It was fantastic. He's like fuck y'all. I'm gonna be famous
*  I'ma be famous like you just kept saying that it just walked off and when he walked off I
*  Was like I was like, oh my god, they booed him like in my head
*  I'm like if they booed him, I don't stand a chance in comedy because
*  Like what just happened when he walked by nobody wanted to touch him because he had that
*  Sweet bomb on him. Yes, and he sits down in
*  In the in the booth right here and I just can't stop looking at him because I'm watching
*  You know how they say the stages of grief like I'm watching
*  The stages of and I keep thinking why doesn't he leave and he's sitting there and Tony Woods goes on stage next
*  And Tony was like wow, man. God damn like just kind of a similar cadence and
*  Tony just
*  destroys got a standing ovation like night and day and I'm just 19
*  Just new like absorbing this
*  Tony walks off stage
*  It's a comic. I'm just kind of like eavesdropping like I think I'm five seven, but I'm fucking six five
*  But I'm just trying to like
*  Look at what they're gonna do next and they get up together and they walk out
*  I kind of just follow him out thinking I don't know what's gonna happen to me. Hey kid wanna hang with us. I don't know
*  They get in the same car and
*  And it's like I think it was a hatchback. I'm not sure and Tony drives off
*  I'm like, whoa, they came together night. That was all I knew of that of that relationship. So
*  And I and I knew that Tony had been doing it a lot longer and I knew that Dave
*  It's kind of like how when Kobe came into the league and was talking like Mike and then Kobe
*  leaned into who Kobe
*  Was became yes speak, you know, I speak Italian I'm speaking Italian I speak like this
*  These are the things that important to me. And so you watched Dave do that separate from Tony
*  But what I love about what Dave did and this is why he's great is he had
*  He recognized Tony in his greatest like comedic moment. Like it's the most honest thing you can do
*  You know, I mean most people be like I did this on me, but he was like
*  And what he said about Tony could not have been truer, you know what I mean?
*  And so it just like touched my heart because I was I was there at the epicenter when I was watching Dave figure it out
*  and it was probably like
*  And it was like and the material he was doing it just didn't connect with it was a blue collar
*  Black crowd. I think he was doing like the superhero stuff like man, you know
*  Wonder Woman's magic last. Oh, I don't hear that magic last
*  So shit like it was just it was just that it wasn't like it wasn't funny cuz to me
*  I'm a 19 year old. I thought the shit was hilarious. So that's the other thing
*  I felt like am I wrong like I'm laughing and you hear boo boo like I was
*  Just and he any any any came down, you know, and then like a couple couple
*  I feel like six months later. I saw him on HBO was I'm like, it's like so I was like damn
*  He didn't let it stop him
*  As I learned like all these lessons just sitting in the back of a comedy club Donnell Rollins who?
*  Might come in and interrupt us now
*  He
*  He too was from that area and yeah, man, and I remember and Donnell
*  Like, you know, you know people talk about come when he was on stage
*  People saying he spoke Korean he did I was like, yeah, who is this dude? And he was the first comic I ever saw
*  Command an audience and I thought the audience
*  Because I was again 19 like I had done comedy more than five times and I hear the audience go do the aspirin bit
*  And he would do his bit about aspirin that would be hilarious
*  Dude do the bike bit and he would do this bit about not getting anybody and I thought I thought this motherfucker had like
*  Like the audience had like requests, you know, I mean, I was like, how great is this dude?
*  Like they know his work and they're requesting it but years later. I didn't know that those were like comics like
*  maybe it might have been comics or it might have been his but he he
*  Always had like he was just so amazing
*  So I had all these references early on as like where you can take the art form, you know
*  And how fearless it was and then I went out to South Bend
*  Well, it was just completely different
*  I was in college, you know, and but I but I had all this like these mental downloads of like of
*  just how
*  these different styles that
*  Hadn't really touched like the Midwest comedy scene
*  It's so funny when you're starting out too because you try to figure out like what style is gonna work
*  Yeah, do I change do I shift? Yeah, who am I?
*  Everybody does yeah have to and that's that's again
*  That's bringing it back to what notebooks is like I want to know what your what your particular thing was
*  I know what mine was but all of ours is different. Yeah, but but we all play the same
*  It's like we play the same sport, but we all play it different ways and I love that shit like
*  So, yeah, it's
*  Ironic that you bought that that show up cuz I was like
*  Yeah, you should bring it up. Yeah, I was so honored that you said you would do it
*  I was happy. Oh shit. That's hilarious. Yeah the legal pad action. It's so old. Yeah, it's just amazing that I kept them
*  Well, yeah, we do you can't axel. Yes, and I'm sure there was certain several times when you were urged to throw them away
*  Yeah, my wife was trying to throw them away. I go no. Yeah, that's what gave me the idea
*  We're trying to toss my
*  Fucking way those are gonna be worth something someday
*  Yeah, and also when I was going through them was always thinking like maybe one day I'll find a gem
*  Yes, a gem in here. Just a premise. Yes a weird premise. It's in there. It's so hard to get that
*  discipline like
*  To literally go through it. Mm-hmm. You know what I mean? How do you write?
*  Do you sit in front of a computer and write you write in front of a notebook question?
*  You have good ideas you just good idea so what I do, you know what I started doing and I'm gonna do a podcast
*  Too it's gonna be called in context with Owen Smith because what I started doing is I started reading a newspaper more
*  and if whenever I read the newspaper my brain fucking explodes with a whole bunch of just
*  Ideas newspaper. Yeah, why newspaper? I like I like physical I like holding it but now I but now I just
*  I'm getting myself to doing the online stuff just because it's it's just more practical because every time I go to get the paper
*  Like it's not I always feel so funny when I'm holding a paper now
*  But I like because you can see the words and you can see like they use
*  Specific word choice and my brain just starts going damn. That's what but my act isn't that right my act
*  Is more personal but just Chris Rock told me something a long time ago. He said I don't suffer
*  from
*  What is it when you when you can't think of anything?
*  Writers Bob. Yeah, I don't suffer from writers block. I suffer from readers block
*  I was like, oh shit and he read he and and do he told me a long time ago
*  If you read the newspaper every day that's equivalent to having a masters
*  Yeah
*  What is GD logic?
*  You have to like do serious research
*  I was a hilarious, okay, you know, but I didn't know he had his GD
*  No shade or D, but I was like
*  Like that stay with me. So I was like so I would always try to like read a whole newspaper
*  I'm what paper to the New York Post you gotta go back. You gotta go back. Yeah
*  You just slide back to fifth grade
*  That's hilarious
*  The New York Post my good every time I read they just shit on people fantastic. It's like it's not a tabloid but it is
*  But they talk shit and it's funny it's funny is New York Post I grab that every time I'm back
*  It's funny shit, man. Yeah, it was uh, so so I've always tried to
*  But you know like shit to come to me in my sleep
*  conversations
*  And for me is about finding what is the right? I don't feel like there's like
*  Where's the best place for this joke to live?
*  You know, I mean, is this a stand-up joke could I get more traction out of this if it's a sketch?
*  You know what I mean? Um, and then if it is a sketch, how can I still make it sing as a stand-up joke?
*  You know
*  and what's fun for me is
*  If I do something and I revisit it and I can do it like a lot cleaner and clearer and it starts then I get excited
*  Cuz then I can play cuz that's the other thing sometimes when you write you forget to play
*  I remember like I think I saw a bill maher or somebody like that
*  Performing he he he he
*  You know, he's kind of just stands there. And so I saw him come off stage one time and he was like man
*  I fucking audience, you know sucked and
*  And
*  And I was thinking in my head like I wouldn't say to him
*  But I mean you just forgot to play like you for right your all your shit was fired, but
*  It was not having fun. Yeah, sometimes, you know, and so when I watch a show when I could see he's playing is like
*  Yeah, it's and so you forget that you forget you forget that. I mean you said he's up to deadlines
*  He's got to do all that stuff. But when I saw him live that day I go
*  Like he was he was trying to figure it out still so he didn't have the little the the
*  And so it's all those little things and so sometimes I
*  Could be too hard on myself trying to get it like technically technically right and when I just remember to play
*  This shit is so fun. You know what I mean? Yeah about creating moments and you forget all of that, but for me
*  I'm always trying to
*  I'm always I don't know man. I'll hear shit. I'll see shit. I'm like, what is that? Like like so
*  Like so right now is black history month
*  All this stuff about one of the King but my head went to you know, this dude the FBI
*  Bugged like they listen to all of his stuff
*  And so I'm now I'm thinking about the guys listening to MLK like you couldn't all be civil rights
*  Like they I wonder if he turned any of them, you know
*  It's got a good point
*  Or they'd be like
*  So that's how you make potato salad, you know, I mean like like just listening to whatever how many people you think we're assigned to
*  Listen, I'm fascinated with it and like I wonder like weird relationship weird relationship
*  and you're getting like
*  You're getting a peek into the word of somebody you're told is this one thing and what if you
*  You know you hear something you just don't agree like I'm fascinated with stuff like that. So I try to like
*  Yeah, if you can make that funny sure and that's where great bits come from and they come from that uncertainty like okay
*  Where is it? We know there's something in that. Yeah, there is something in some FBI some square FBI dude
*  Yeah, listen to Martin Luther King. Yeah
*  Yeah, there's a there's like there's a thing that he could say, yeah that would turn him yeah
*  So I play with stuff like that so sometimes one of the one of my favorite comedians I
*  have a whole bunch but
*  Comedians that always gets me or people that well I go I didn't know comedy could do that
*  So I remember when I heard Dick Gregory on it's an album called Dick Gregory on
*  And he was the first black millionaire to do stand-up and he has a great book
*  He has a book called nigger, but his best book
*  I won't say best but my favorite book of his is called the shadow that scares me and it's
*  really him like giving solutions to all of these like
*  problems that that are you know that were in the narrative at that time about black folks and I just was I was amazed at his
*  Writing and I was blown away by his
*  Stand up some of the social commentary with me right and I was like, oh man, I want to do some of that
*  So I used to that was back in my 30s and I was trying to solve the race problem
*  You know what I mean? I was like I ain't fucking with that no more like
*  That's out my system like but I used to because because I was still in the orbit of the bring the pain like oh
*  I gotta have my and I
*  Right and it just I was like, it's not really changing the world man. It's making some points
*  But I kind of like backed away because I used to do this bit
*  about
*  Being at a rap concert
*  Busta rhymes and it's all white folks and I'm there and he goes all my real niggas make some noise
*  Everybody made noise
*  Me like the two other black
*  Yo
*  There's some hilarious
*  You can't say it but but can you cheer right?
*  So
*  Then I go
*  Maybe maybe they didn't hear him but in hip-hop you say everything twice
*  So he said again, like I said all my real niggas make some noise
*  And so I was like man, not only I was like white people niggas now
*  This is what I'm saying. I was doing this shit like in Milwaukee
*  And I go and not only can we call them nigga they paying $80 for the privilege
*  To be caught $80 a ticket and I'll go white folks tonight. I'll call you nigga for ten
*  Ten dollars nigga sale nigga clearance cash only cuz I know how you niggas are right?
*  So proud of this bit
*  at the end of the show, I'm selling my dumb DVDs, you know some of my merch and
*  Inevitably a white person always come up to me give me $20 and call me Nick
*  Like that's not the bit
*  So
*  Late 20s early 30s, you you know, you know, you know, you're the angry comic like what the fuck
*  I have a you know, and then now I'm a little older I go man
*  I'd be funny if I cuz I kept the money, you know, I mean
*  Like if that was my stick like I didn't sell my
*  Call me whatever y'all want for 20 dollars
*  I
*  Know for me just living in that space man
*  I was just like nah after I tried it and I was getting that kind of response
*  I just was a thing to where you when you're a comic like you want to be respected
*  So you want to come up with a bit that like it transcends comedy?
*  Yeah, you want it you want everybody to go Wow, he's on some real shit. Yeah, you know, it's I think
*  There's a danger in that and that you can kind of trick yourself
*  You can like I had some dumb bits that I did that were like I was just trying to get people to think that I was
*  Really good rather than it just being good. Yeah being good just from a real place. It's
*  So much of it I had this conversation with Robert Downey Jr. About acting
*  Something I said to him and he said exactly I said isn't a lot of it is just about getting out of your own way
*  Because that's what a lot of it is with comedy. I think it's with acting. I think it's probably with music
*  I think it's probably with everything
*  I think you got to get out of your own way because the way you look at yourself the way you want people to look at
*  You you know back
*  You can hold you back
*  How many conversations have you ever had with a comic and they talk about how they want like the respect of the industry?
*  They want the people to look at them these fucking people don't respect me and it's like god damn
*  Do you hear yourself? Yeah, you're wasting all this mental fuel on this nonsense
*  My mother-in-law has the best saying my wife says it all the time. She goes
*  If you worry about yourself, you have a busy busy time
*  If you worry about you, you have a busy busy time and you know
*  Because when you hear people going off I want them they don't see that. Hey, man
*  Just worry about you all the shit you have to do you focus on that you'll be busy enough and nothing could be
*  You know truer than that when I hear, you know comics do that
*  You know comics come up with a lot of excuses. So many things aren't going on my favorite one. Yes
*  They don't want white men
*  They don't want white straight men. I'm like what in the fuck are you even heard talking about?
*  I've heard that and they said that to me
*  That is so fucking crazy. Okay, man
*  It's literally 90% of all comedians. Oh, they're not trying. Here's one thing that is true. Yeah, there are
*  Certain networks and certain that are trying to get people that are not white men. That's true
*  However, there's still a fucking shitload that are getting specials
*  Yes. Yes the idea that that's somehow an embedded really pushing the the you know, it just lacks so much
*  Self-awareness to say that there's a problem being a white man. It's
*  When they say it to me, you understand I'd be like
*  What do I do with this?
*  So it's so not self-aware what no one guy came to me one time at the comedy store and he was
*  complaining about not being able to get on staff and
*  As a paid regular
*  Yeah, but he wanted to be like a writer writer
*  And but I and I it came out that he's he sold shows in the so I go so you have a quote
*  And I go you mommy. What's your quote? And he tell me he told me his quote
*  I go do you know what a staff writer makes I go you're not getting hired because
*  You have a quote and you know me like no one's ever worked with you in the room
*  You need to know explain what that means for people. Okay, what them? Oh, so
*  so
*  When you so everything
*  When you sell a television show they give you a
*  Contract of terms in case the television show goes and they agree to pay you an amount per
*  Episode of the show of the show that you sold whether it's a variety TV show whether it's unscripted
*  Whatever all those terms are agreed
*  in advance and
*  That is what's called your quote and that quote is specific to
*  The studio you you did the deal with because but that quote can travel to another studio
*  so if you go someplace else they may give you the
*  Bare minimum offer and you can go I I have a quote right if you are a staff writer and so and typically
*  That quote is is a decent amount right per episode so but typically if you're a staff writer, I think you get paid
*  I'm gonna say it's less than six thousand dollars a week is how they the math would work out and
*  So you have this thing where
*  You have this quote that's probably thirty thousand dollars an episode
*  I don't know what that would track a week because they amortize it over however long your your stated to work
*  And as a staff writer you're getting paid like this amount so
*  No showrunner in their right mind is gonna just
*  Ask you to take a pay cut right from your quote
*  Your people won't allow them to do that
*  And no showrunner is gonna hire you at that high quote if you've never been in the room before like I'm not gonna pay you
*  Thirty thousand dollars an episode to learn you know what I mean
*  So it's a lot of math missed in your in this this complaint complaint that you have built for yourself
*  Which is fine, I just don't want to hear it because I know the math so it's like I hope I did a good job
*  No, that makes sense, but it's like it's like yeah, man. You succeeded at selling several shows
*  So that's like the lane you're in unless you come in and go listen. I'll take a pay cut
*  I want to learn I need to get
*  If that's really what you want to do when I told him that
*  It was like I don't know you ever tell somebody like a different solution and the face they make is I wish you know
*  Take pictures of Ian sleep. I wish I got pictures of like that face like when the light bulb goes on yeah, yeah
*  Oh, that's what's wrong, but the difference is I think between successful people and people who are moderately successful is
*  They're open to that right like you just told me put notebooks on on YouTube guess where's gonna be it's gonna be on fucking YouTube
*  You know saying I'm going to do it like
*  I'm not gonna be like I don't know
*  You know you you actually connected what I've been thinking like the whole time
*  It's almost like you just
*  Gave me that extra like incentive to yeah, man. I'm doing this now, so I
*  Checked in with him. No. He didn't you know didn't do anything and it's almost think like he he needs to feel
*  That he's being you know
*  So yeah, yeah stacked again, so it fuels. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay?
*  Feel like he's being maligned yeah, yeah, that's a thing this room. Yeah, yeah, yes that fucking Hollywood world of
*  It's a gross world man through the fact that you live here and figured out how to succeed outside of it is
*  in a diabolical
*  But I'm kind of not oh my god, yeah
*  Go to meetings, so do you do you say no no no no people come here? No, there's no meetings
*  There's no meetings. I say no to everything I say no to every interview. I say no to every meeting
*  I say no to everything I'm just a notebook he didn't know books
*  Yeah, but I said yes to that anything my friends do that's not interested. I don't want any meetings
*  I don't want to do anything more than what I'm already doing. Did you have this vision?
*  Oh, that's wrong to ask you because I just had an audition today, and I want to ask you did you ever go for auditions?
*  Yes
*  Did you?
*  Did it become a?
*  Thing that you set out to be great at or was it always something that you just were like I'm gonna see what?
*  Where this takes me I'll give you the craziest
*  Story about auditions ever as far as success stories. I auditioned for two shows ever I got both of them
*  Shows I ever auditioned for I auditioned for a show called hardball that was on Fox was a terrible baseball show
*  I got that started off really good, but the network fucked it up, and then I auditioned for news radio, and I got that
*  So two shows in a row so then did you want me to it though?
*  Did you have to go do the first audition callback test and all that all that yeah, okay? Do you remember who else was?
*  No, but I remember news radio. I remember see news radio. I was 26 so that was only like
*  Four years from when I was fighting right so I had a different feeling of fear and anxiety
*  Than a lot of people did and I was in the the waiting room
*  I didn't know there was an open call and the open call wasn't an open call, but it was like a cattle call
*  There was like 50 fucking dudes waiting to get in there, and you would read, but was interesting it wasn't funny
*  I was like what is this, but they did it on purpose they wanted to cut out all the corn balls
*  So they gave you lines, and you had to play it straight
*  Like the play it was like me trying to figure I was a handyman at this radio station
*  It's how to put I had to figure something out, and I was like I don't know what's going on
*  And they're like, but you're supposed to fix it, but yeah
*  But I can't fix it so I don't know what to do like that kind of thing like there was no there was no punchline
*  I told my manager was like I don't know I go the pilot was really funny because I saw the pilot and there was
*  Another guy on the pilot Ray Romano was actually the original guy on the pilot and they fired him
*  Replaced him with another guy then they fired that guy and then they had a call to see who the next guy would be and
*  Then I went in to read for it
*  And then the first like the first script was not it was just straight. It was weird
*  So I said I don't know what to do with it
*  I said I'm just gonna do it straight and so then I got a call back
*  And then I got new sides and the new sides were hilarious and I and then I realized like oh
*  They're trying to cut out the corn balls. Yeah, they got a bunch of wacky
*  You know fucking real obvious sitcom guys
*  So I went in for the second call and it was me and three other dudes and they looked like they were about to get
*  Shipped off to Vietnam. They were white pale sweaty everyone was nervous
*  And I just I remember looked at them and go oh I got this and I sat down and I plopped my feet up on
*  The couch and I just I just kept kick back and relaxed
*  I relaxed I felt good. I was like well nervous you fucks are yes, are you guys gonna go in there and choke?
*  Yeah, so I just went in there and did it and but also the thing for me is I never wanted to be an actor
*  I just did it for the money
*  Yeah
*  like when when I got an audition for
*  Hardball it was because Disney gave me a bunch of money for a development deal because I did stand up on MTV
*  So I did the MTV half-hour comedy hour and then MTV they they offered me the most ridiculous deal ever
*  It was like 500 bucks to do a pilot and then if if if they decide to do it
*  Even if they decide to shoot it and never film it they have you locked up exclusively for two years
*  It was so ridiculous
*  It was because they had made celebrities with like Dennis Leary like Dennis Leary become famous from MTV and then he left
*  So they're like, you know, we're gonna keep people here now, you know, we're gonna if we make someone a star
*  We're gonna keep them and so they they offered the most ridiculously lowball deal of all time
*  So I said no to that we said no to that and then my manager sent my tape out and said hey
*  This guy is about to sign this deal with you know, someone, you know, if you guys are interested do it now
*  I think he said might have said MTV
*  So then we got all these offers and so I don't know I couldn't answer my phone
*  They told me don't answer my phone. Just go to the pool hall. Stop stop answer your phone
*  People are calling me at home and this is back in the day. I didn't have a cell phone
*  Yeah, so then two weeks later
*  I'm in Hollywood having meetings and then a month later in Boston. Yeah, I was in New York
*  Okay, then a month later. I'm living there a month later. I'm out in Hollywood with Jim Brewer
*  Jim Brewer was on the show with me in the pilot. He was the opposing mascot. He was hilarious
*  So me and Jim were buddies from back in the day. So we're all hanging out and then
*  You know that show got picked up. I did like six episodes of that show. It got canceled
*  I'm just hanging out the store every night and then I'm ready to go back home to New York
*  But I had already signed a lease so I was fucking apartment for a year and I couldn't get out of it
*  So I'm like goddamn and then I got a development deal with them with NBC
*  Based on the hardball show and so they said hey before we talk to you about doing your own show
*  We'd like you to look at this pilot and see if you'd be interested in it
*  And it's Dave Foley and Phil Hartman and Andy dick and I'm like, holy shit. I'm like really I'm like, yeah
*  Yeah, I'm interested in this and then I came in and read for the next thing
*  You know, I had it next thing. No, I'm on TV sit
*  Like I've been doing acting for like a couple of months and I'm sitting at a table next to Phil Hartman
*  I'm like this is crazy
*  Like this is fucking crazy and all these different people and that were on the show. It was fascinating man
*  It's fascinating because I it's not something I ever wanted
*  I was not interested in it at all, but all sudden it was happening
*  I was like, huh
*  But that's part of probably why I was able to do it because it wasn't like this dream it was paralyzing me with
*  anticipation and anxiety
*  When I walked in that second audition, I saw those dudes sweating
*  I was like look at you nervous fucks. It brought me back to fighting because fighting I used to I used to love seeing how
*  Nervous people were before fights and I would take naps
*  I would lay down on the ground like in the in the bleachers because just to let everybody know I'm just gonna go
*  You guys are all nervous
*  Because it was you're playing psychological games like when I would knock guys out I walk away like it was normal like even though
*  I was freaked out. Oh that dude's unconscious. I'll just walk around like that's what I do, dude
*  I do that shit every day. I'm gonna do it to you, too
*  Really?
*  And so when I was in that that room getting ready to go in and read I had the same feeling like oh you guys are
*  nervous
*  I was like this like oh I got that guy. Well, also I was the only comic
*  Yeah, those guys weren't comics. They weren't used to performing live and all that. That's a giant advantage
*  I love that like when I would audition and like a really good-looking
*  Guy walk in I'm like funny
*  Like seriously, I would have no fear. I'm like whatever. You know, this is a comedy. Yeah. Good luck
*  I
*  Have no fear, you know, it's too hard to be good-looking and funny
*  Come on man, you're gonna be funny to me. Let's do it. The reason I did fear factor cuz I didn't want to work with actors anymore
*  When that came up I was like cuz I had I had auditioned for like
*  One or two sitcoms that I didn't get after fear factor
*  But it was also was a thing where it's like man
*  I need to make some money like I'm not making as much money doing stand-up and I was used to making TV money and
*  Had development deals and they didn't go and then I auditioned for a couple shows and that didn't happen and then I guess
*  It was like two years because fear factor
*  Yeah
*  2000 2001 fear factor was 2001 and news radio ended in 99 and
*  It was a it was an opportunity to do something no actors. I was like fuck
*  Yeah, I'm in because even the audition process is even a weirder
*  You're dealing with all these mind games that people are playing in the in the waiting room
*  It's like you people are so strange
*  They're the strangest people because their life is centered around getting people to like them for auditions, right?
*  So they're always they're always trying to pretend they're exactly what these casting people want in terms of their
*  Political beliefs the way they talk the way they act
*  There's nothing weirder than being around
*  unsuccessful actors
*  ones that are trying to make it like once they're successful like if you're talking to like Robert Downey Jr
*  He's a regular dude man. Yeah, he's a regular dude, but he's he's famous as fuck and super successful
*  You know, there's a lot of those guys like that. Yeah, you know what I equate that to
*  When I first moved out here
*  Before before you get on the lot, right and you're competing with everyone then that's when you hear
*  People in Hollywood are shady people. Yeah, you can't trust because we all were basically unemployed
*  You know right competing for the same yeah, man, I'm gonna meet you I'm gonna meet you
*  Hey, none of us got you like we all talking right, but once I got my like my first gig
*  I'm in a different character of people
*  And so it is something about it is something about people who figured out
*  You know how to make a living in town that they have a you know, not more
*  You know integrity and a little more credible and honest and you go you're a real dude
*  But yeah, when you first get here you're throwing that line where everybody's just like struggling it took me back to like basketball
*  AAU
*  Where like I I loved playing I wanted to be a globetrotter like I know I do like all the tricks and all that stuff
*  I love having fun and when you start
*  Getting when I started looking at colleges and getting recruited. I always is becoming a business
*  Mmm, and I wasn't ready for that, you know, and I literally liked having fun like playing basketball and I will be playing
*  It's some tournaments with some kids and like I'm like damn, you know, you got a kid
*  Oh shit, like you playing for your family, you know, I mean like and I'm up there like
*  Having a good time and it was serious for them. And so, you know just like
*  so when I when I came out here I
*  Fell into the commercial world for I started booking commercials a lot and I still I still do if I go out
*  My wife was like you should go back out for commercials again because I had the same mindset where
*  Alright, man
*  As a comic I get it. I get the joke. I know how to like, you know nail it
*  I've booked
*  Pilots, but then I like because I write to I could see like all the rewriting happening on set
*  I could tell if it's gonna go in that because they always lately they've been trying to cute and everything up and I go
*  I get it
*  But in the 12th hour when you guys are deciding what you know, the cute shows not gonna make it so
*  What do you mean by cute and everything up? We're
*  We're like so I was before he walked in I was like, did you watch curb last last night?
*  I did a funny thing about a handicapped placard, right? And so
*  And it just spoke to everybody wants one of those things
*  Hey, man, you know and they did a montage of all the stitch you would do if you had a handicapped placard
*  That might that might be in the pilot at first and you'd be you'd be howling and then as you're shooting it
*  Man, the handicapped thing is coming off little mean. What if we make it? Oh
*  You know I mean and then like they button it up to it's not as gratifying because you're laughing at but just the primal
*  Yeah, man, I would do the same shit. I'm rocking with this show to the they cute it up and they're worried about the repercussions
*  Yeah, they take the edge off it. Yeah, so then so when you watch it
*  Back you go. We got this show. We got this show
*  Yeah, I don't really know anybody in this show this guy's a known face. They're both cute put the known face out, you know
*  But again, I am literally armchair quarterbacking like it could be a series of things like, you know
*  But it's rare that someone does it right? That's what's interesting with new shows
*  It's not like there's a lot of people that are doing it right and there's a lot of great new shows
*  No, what do you think is the next thing though? I think
*  First of all streaming services have changed the whole game things like stranger things
*  Yes, things like those kind of shows now
*  There's a new show on HBO that I'm addicted to call the outsider. Is that good? Fuck? Yeah. Yeah, it's fucking good
*  It's fucking good. It's terrifying. I was very it grabs me like cuz I watch curb and it obviously like the last two minutes
*  Like it's the last two minutes. I see you I'm like, yo, it's Jason Bateman
*  Jason Bateman knows his shit because Ozarks amazing. Yeah, those kind of shows
*  They're so off the charts in terms of like what you could get away with a network television
*  Right now our television is just so hampered. They're so confined. They have shackles
*  They just can't do anything wild anything anything outside the norm. They can't take any chance. I mean this on
*  Spoiler alert on the outsider you see a dead kid like 30 seconds into the first episode
*  Yeah, you can not not just dead but mauled. I mean, it's horrible
*  I mean, it's it's a stunning visual and if you can't handle that it's only you know
*  It's not like something you see a lot right throughout the whole show, but it's enough to fuck you up
*  But they'll let you know like hey, this is not CBS, right?
*  This is this is chaos like this is as realistic a horror show as you're gonna get
*  interesting
*  when I watch
*  Yeah, it's like everything. Everything is like a different palette, right? Yeah, like if you
*  on if a network show is like clicking I
*  Can get how people would get you know fall in love with that the romance of that like oh, this is good
*  Yeah, but the but the process the creative process
*  Coming from a stand-up brain
*  You know, I'm a stand-up first it's it is it's very collaborative and it is like you say it's collaborative with a lot of people who
*  At certain stages you're like
*  Yeah, you know, yeah, but but then you saw because I'm just going through it
*  So I was trying to I'm being like very diplomatic and I go. Okay. Well what?
*  Why why do you have this job? What do you do? And it's also like
*  How do we talk to one another because I know what I'm thinking like what is so I'm using it as and I think
*  Cuz I'm an I'm a parent now. So I'm just like when I say my if you know, I'm in this space of just trying to figure out
*  Yeah
*  Cuz 26 year old me would be like man. What the fuck are you talking about?
*  You know or just been like this is stupid this but I'm in this space right now. Well, I'm like, okay, I
*  Know I don't like how you talking to me right now
*  I don't even understand it, but I need to I think I need to try to figure it out. Hmm and
*  You know
*  This is interesting. Yeah working with people can be rewarding. Mm-hmm. You definitely learn about communication
*  Yeah, the problem is it's never as good as your stand-up. No, no
*  Yeah, that's real. Yeah, the problem is you are already a great stand
*  I know and it's like I'm trying to create a life over here this that's that but it's the attraction of the business
*  The business pulls you in the business offers you money. Yeah, the business offers you security
*  They don't make money off your stand-up in this town. No, no
*  Unless it's a fucking booking agency. They don't make shit off of it, right? The business offers you this stability
*  You're gonna go to CBS Radford. You're gonna pull in every day. Hi, I'm Owen Smith
*  I'm working on the blah blah blah and go in there. You got your parking spot. Whoa, I did it man
*  I did it for years and years and years, you know, I did it for five years on news radio. Yeah, it's attractive
*  But that's what people love it. I'll tell you like you did it all. Yeah, so it's like I've done both things
*  Yeah, I've done well, I've done I did two shows that went to syndication
*  Yeah
*  I did news radio that went to syndication and then I did fear factor that did syndication and I
*  Get offers all the time to do stuff on TV. I don't want to have anything to do with it
*  How did you and Stephen they what what happened I went to ask you that both talking about boxing that was like it was an
*  Amazing and I made I was amazing thing to watch
*  He's a generalist. Yes, and I and you were very specific and that's but but why was that?
*  Together. Yeah, because they were trying to he's a very popular guy
*  Okay, and you know, there was a big event Conor McGregor's
*  Cowboy Saroni and then ESPN obviously it's on ESPN. Okay, so he's an ESPN star
*  Yeah, and
*  It was clearly that I felt like I was watching an open mic
*  headliner, yeah both
*  Have a take on the topic. It's not he does not have it's not a good place
*  Like if you're coming from you're coming at martial arts, especially MMA you have to have a deep
*  Understanding of the sport you can't just have a peripheral knowledge and communicate with someone like me. I've been doing this a long time
*  That's what a long time. I've been working for the UFC since 1997 and I've been involved in martial arts since I was
*  1415 years old so it's this is not the casual to me and I'm balls deep in it and I'm also very very
*  Respectful very respectful to the fighters very very understanding of what's going on
*  And I look at it in a very comprehensive way. His whole thing is making controversy
*  You know his whole thing is he's a great shit talker and he's great at it's shitting on people
*  He's great at mocking people's performances. He's just a powerful
*  Communicator and an entertainer the problem is you carry that over to MMA man. Those fans are not having that right?
*  That's what yeah, he turned on him like wolves. Yeah
*  Yeah, I didn't say anything mean man. I didn't say
*  Way way way meaner shit. I was that's why I was watching. I was like
*  Yeah, I don't have anything against that guy. I think he's entertaining but it's uh, it's just you can't say cowboy quit
*  He got his face smashed in he got head kicked. I mean just just doesn't understand what went down
*  You can't say Connor didn't show you anything. He just ran right through a top welterweight in 40 seconds. He's a beast
*  It's like I understand what he's trying to do
*  He's trying to apply the same sort of way of talking about sports that he talks about
*  Maybe if it's a basketball game or maybe it's something else. He's trying to apply that to MMA. It's a different thing
*  It's a different thing. There's no knockdowns you get knocked down the guy gets on top of you and punches your fucking face in
*  You know I'm saying it's not like boxing this it's so it is as raw as a sport ever gets you don't even wearing shoes
*  You know you get your fingers are exposed you got pads on your knuckles you're allowed to elbow someone in the eyeball
*  You're allowed to kick them in the fucking face with your shin
*  Your shin bone slamming into someone's nose that happens all the time. That's normal. That's a normal day at the office
*  It's a crazy sport man. Yeah, so for that sport
*  you have to be super respectful and appreciative of what's going on because
*  Those guys are putting their health on the line in a big big big way and those girls too
*  Those girls fuck each other up man. It's rough to watch
*  That was one of the hardest thing for me to get over watching girls get fucked up
*  Because you don't think about that right? I mean I saw that in the tag window days. I definitely saw girls get KO'd
*  but it wasn't as it wasn't as
*  Normal like in MMA like you see girls get just smashed man
*  You see him get smashed like girls that fight Amanda Nunes. She just beats the fuck out of them. Yeah, whoa
*  It's crazy sport man, but I don't have anything against even though that's not why I bought it up
*  I was just talking about TV. That's what I like. Yeah, the the interesting ideas that come from a different place
*  What if we take Joe and put him in that world?
*  I don't want to be involved in that world like the SPA wanted to give me a job like no not interested
*  I don't want to have anything to do with that
*  This is what like we did this fight companion podcast on Saturday night Saturday during the day
*  yeah fight the fights were from New Zealand the UFC fights before the ties of fury by Deontay wilder fight and
*  We were talking about it and my friend Eddie was like, how come they don't do something like this on TV
*  I'm like they couldn't there's no way we're drinking. We have whiskey. We're smoking weed. We're talking crazy shit
*  You know Brendan shop every girl this bitch's ass and this and that everyone's talking crazy
*  It's they're talking like guys normally talk we're sitting around but we're doing it over the internet
*  Yeah, but it gets millions of views
*  So it's one of those things where like if a network had a show like that, they'd be like this is this is a hit
*  Yeah, it's a giant hit for a sports show
*  That's why for a sports show to get way more views than the actual show. It's watching. So it's a fight companion
*  We're watching the fights and we're talking about the fights
*  But that gets more than twice as many views as the actual fights itself, which is kind of crazy
*  That's very crazy
*  But the only way that happens is if no executive none of those half in half out people were talking about before that
*  I really could work at the Discovery Channel or the History Channel
*  They're trying to cute and things up trying to take the edge off. Look guys
*  We're gonna cut that segment around when you're talking about those girls asses
*  It's just kind of disrespectful and you know, I've got kids my own and I've got daughters like get the fuck out of here
*  Like you know if we had a producer in here there like some some networks
*  Right there. Oh my god giving us notes at the end of every show. Yeah, you couldn't do it
*  Yeah when I worked on um late night talk shows
*  the whole narrative of freedom of speech was in the air and
*  That's whenever we would write something it all had to be legally approved
*  I got the first time I saw that a lawyer would come and he'd be like
*  You guys can't say you know
*  All right, man, sorry, you know we'd figure out you know
*  Yeah in ways and then and then you'd go out in the world people like freedom of speech
*  I mean this shit is all legally approved man. What you're seeing in this space is
*  It's not like you said like but but when you guys could just say whatever you
*  Is to narrow it down to as few voices as possible to have control like this
*  This is you and me and and Jamie's hanging out
*  This is a three-man crew that reaches millions and millions of people that's insane like that's insane
*  That's never happened before but that's the only reason why it works
*  Yeah, because you don't have any like my sensibilities are all fucked up. They're not normal like my what I think is okay
*  Yeah, in terms of drugs and violence and all the different things that I enjoy. Yes. I mean, I'm a hunter
*  I bow hunt animals, you know, that's what I eat
*  My ever I would smoke pot all the time, you know, I'm always swearing. Yeah, like I don't believe in any of these things
*  I I I you know, I just think that when you're when you're putting together a show
*  there's no way you would ever let a person like me be responsible for the the the job of
*  promoting something a push like being the captain of a show where you got all these
*  Executives and their jobs are on the line and you're gonna have some loose cannon like me who's a wild stand-up comic
*  Like my everything I've done has been wild all from the beginning from fighting to getting the stand-up from all it's wild
*  It's wild stuff. That's what I like. I like when it's chaos. That's what I enjoy
*  Yeah, but there's no way you could ever have a network approve something like this
*  There's no way the language saying cunt saying whatever the fuck you want to say talking about things in an honest way talking about what's
*  Bullshit about life about politics about the the the state of the way human beings communicate with each other
*  Yeah
*  You you got to boil it down or just a couple of people when you boil it down
*  Especially guys like you and me who are comics
*  Yeah
*  We could talk real about stuff who aren't scared of saying their flaws aren't scared of saying where they fucked up and how you know
*  It's though some of my favorite conversations are when you talk about this this shit you fucked up when you were young and dumb
*  It's fun people hide from that stuff. Yeah, they don't like it
*  They don't like to feel like they're inadequate or or they always like to feel like they were always good
*  Like that's all nonsense. Yeah, this kind of thing where you're doing a podcast
*  This is I think this is the future of all those talk shows those talk shows are dwindling
*  They are like they're like flowers in the desert man. They're not getting enough water
*  There's no one watching if you look at the numbers like Conan show. It's horrible and
*  You know, he's a legend. Yeah, and all these guys are legends, but there's no one's watching that shit anymore
*  Yeah, because you could watch this or any other podcasters
*  Something like nine hundred thousand of them
*  Oh wow, and you could watch them or listen into them anytime you want
*  Yeah, you could stop it when you have to take a shit you can come back
*  You know, you don't have to wait for it to come on. You know, none of that nonsense
*  Yeah, you listen in your car. You could watch it in on your computer like this is and people are being real
*  They this is a different world now with the internet
*  There's too much real information for you to get spoon-fed nonsense on television
*  You know that those like when I watch those CBS shows like those crime shows
*  I'm like all people are watching this right all people and people that like have chemicals at work and they come home drunk
*  You know what I mean? Like there's something about it's something in the air
*  I just want to sit and have something mindless spoon-fed to them
*  And just that's those network shows that's what keeps those things alive
*  Yeah, those things are so watered down and so nonsense
*  It's not real life. I wanted to come I wanted to tell you I got I got beef with Malcolm Gladwell
*  Really you spoke to him. Yes, you need to connect us. What do you have beef with him?
*  But I love him, right? Okay, listen, you listen to stuff all the time
*  And then he he did something with some guy
*  He was
*  And it's like like I couldn't watch him anymore I was like so angry and
*  And I watched a few clips of him here and I said man, I miss Malcolm
*  But uh, he needs to know you can't be if you really said that he's he just he said
*  No, I just not understand what it is. Well, I want him to I want him to like I want to take him to a black room
*  I want him to stay like the real this room. You know, I mean go do you think?
*  I see it just see him bomb just feel it cuz you just crackle feel the heat
*  Yeah, yeah
*  Yes
*  It's like and it's me. It's like man
*  You wrote a book about ten thousand hours and you sitting there going I could do this
*  It's like come on man. Don't do that
*  It seems like but this is what I've been saying about stand-up for a while is that if you talk to someone
*  Yeah, they a lot of people have been funny in their life
*  Most people said something funny everyone can talk. Yes, right. So all you're doing up there is talking and you say something funny
*  It seems like I can do it. Yeah, but did you do it? Yeah, but you're talking and saying something funny
*  The people who know you and love you know your quirks and your ticks and all that right?
*  You're in front of strangers, right who may or may not be in that audience
*  That's the difference of gene. I don't know if you've ever seen this but there's a lot of people that are maybe
*  Podcasters or they do other things and then they're doing stand-up occasionally
*  Oh, yes, they're crowd. Yes, and they think they're doing good stand-up
*  But then they'll go on in the store and we'll get sandwiched into a lineup in the OR of murderers. Yes, and then it's
*  Ugly it gets ugly because fast reality sets in
*  Because if they're all there to see you and they're all your fans and they paid money here you talk
*  They just want to see you hey, there's the guy from the show
*  Yeah
*  And they've probably never been in the comedy club
*  So if Malcolm is doing these speeches and he's doing these speeches in front of these large audiences
*  He's probably said some funny things. Yeah, so he probably thinks that he can do stand-up
*  It's a funny guy, but when he got I was like, ah man, I need I need I need this I need to find dude
*  I need to talk to it's it's not when it's it's I don't think people understand what it is
*  It's a weird it's a very weird art form because I think it's only truly appreciated
*  By people have done it like truly appreciated in terms of what's actually happening
*  Yeah
*  And it took me years to realize that what was going on when you're killing is a sort of a form of hypnosis
*  There's a the my the the audience is letting you into their mind and they're letting you think for them
*  That's why when you have clunky shit or you blow yourself up or you you have a distorted perception
*  Of yourself or you have too many words. It's like annoying. It's frustrating
*  It's hard for people to absorb you lose some of that grip that you have on them
*  but when someone has an economy of words and they lock in and
*  Their jokes are tight and then they keep going and going you lost you're lost in their thoughts
*  You just let those people carry I love it
*  I love my favorite things to sit in the audience and loves someone killing I just go along with them like ah
*  So fun it's so fun but to break that down to just sentences and words and you say this you say that it's not that
*  There's so much more to it so many elements. That's why I love watching like oh, you know what?
*  I wish I wish there was a stand-up show, you know, you know how
*  like I love
*  Now that some of these ex NBA players are on ESPN because now they're speaking about the game from being players
*  Yes, so you have people who clearly have never played right, you know very are, you know, very learned it, you know, you know pundits
*  That ain't it man
*  You ain't ever do this is this this this this this that team gonna lose and then the thing
*  Love that shit and I wish I wish that
*  There was a show like that for stand-ups we could like watch a stand-up special. It would be real
*  It would be hard I know because this is come across as hating but it's not dog shit special
*  No, you know, and I know there's something should have never happened and you watch them and you'd have to break it down
*  You'd have to go. This is nonsense. Yeah, but I but I enjoy
*  Figuring out that puzzle. Yeah, like we couldn't do it publicly. No
*  You know what I've been doing, you know, some of my favorite people to do this with me and Eddie pepper sitting the back of the
*  room just
*  So fun
*  Then we go over do I when you see bullshit comedy is fun to watch sometimes it's so fun
*  but but what I'm saying like what you know, what's John I'm fascinated by that thing where
*  We're truth-tellers. We're honest. We we spend our whole lives trying to figure out what our truth is
*  But we can't speak truth about certain
*  Things still yeah because it's a bad optics is bad thing is bad optics good what is but it's like
*  My intention is to help it. You know what I mean? Like my intention is not that's why I said I don't I don't
*  Like I'm not walking around going this guy sucks. I love that you say is dog shit, but I
*  Just feel like you what you should have you should have taken a year, you know me and this is a good start
*  But it's what I think it's a case in fighting no, yeah bad at fighting
*  There's people that are terrible at oh my god
*  And then they you know, they try to fight professionally and they get crushed
*  Yeah, and then there's people that are really good at it and you watch them and you go. Oh, I see
*  What is what's what's separating the creativity the aggression the the understanding the technical aspects of it?
*  That's the same with stand-up. There's people that are mediocre at music
*  Terrible at poetry there's people that are just they just they did, you know, maybe they'd still on their early notebooks
*  You know, I mean, maybe it's just a journey and they just haven't gotten to the point yet
*  But there's also a thing where you were talking about bits that you would do where you try to get people to think about you
*  A certain way. I see a lot of that today. You see a lot of this weird woke comedy
*  oh, yeah, where it's like they're just they're setting out to try to
*  To establish this like social justice premise rather than be funny
*  But it's almost the funny way think it's the same
*  Mentality and so it's almost always people that are not not really successful yet
*  Maybe if you've had a little bit of success at taste
*  But it's the same mentality as those phony actors that haven't made it
*  Whether they don't say nice to meet you because they might have met you already. So they say good to see you
*  Good to see you. What does that mean? You know me and my friend
*  Dwayne Kennedy we we we were working on a show at time
*  We were walked a lot and we would just walk up to him. We go. I'm hearing good things
*  Because it is it's right there is up is something with you. Hey man, I'm hearing good things. Yes
*  Good
*  Actors yes. Yeah, I have a person I know and her boyfriend is a
*  Not a comic an actor that hasn't made it and he's brutal because all he talks about is like that this guy
*  I don't like his choices like you can't you can't even watch a preview with them. Oh, yeah
*  Like whatever happened in his career like bitch what you don't have a career. What are you saying?
*  Shitting on this guy pay attention to you and you'll have a busy busy, but it's it's not just that
*  It's like it's uncomfortable to be around them because that's all they care about is making it and acting. It's all they care about
*  They're not like balanced people that can just talk true. Yeah, I know some comics like that
*  Yes, and then when you're struggling when you're in the struggle, yeah
*  the struggle is a
*  Motherfucker because it's a mindfuck and then also the pressure of that struggle overwhelms you
*  And then when you actually do get a break it's there's so much weight to it you can't carry it
*  Do you have anything now?
*  Do you look back at
*  Maybe
*  I have you seen some comedies like cuz like when you're in that struggle, you're not your best self, right?
*  Yeah, shit could have sure. Yeah, have you said have you like?
*  ever like made amends or anything like, you know, or just like
*  Forgiving people like quietly because you understand it now
*  It's kind of like being a parent like before you're a parent you have you see the world one way then you become a parent
*  Yeah, you see that you know, it's like yeah, I talk about that a lot that I think of people as being I meet a guy
*  He's 42. He's always been 42 and then it's just this is who he is and I realized oh, he was a baby
*  He was a baby and then he went through all these years and here he is all fucked up and confused. Yes
*  Yeah, yes, it's I'm fascinated but that too I'm a very forgiving person I forgive people as often as I can
*  Yeah, I don't think there's any there's no benefit to holding a grudge. I agree. I agree with that, especially in our business
*  We're in a wild business where people take chances, right wild people that take chances like you gotta cut you guys come right?
*  Yeah, and I love that you always embrace that like you you know, who else embraces people being who they are. I'm Debbie Allen is like that
*  Yeah, yeah, man. It's like people want to protect people like you know, I mean, yeah
*  They kind of like walk the world like with no judgment and I like I
*  Like being like that like I love when people do fucked up shit
*  No, I'm fast. I'm like, I'm just one of them. Yeah, whoa, and then what?
*  Maybe you shouldn't
*  I like chaos
*  I like people realizing that they fucked up and then talking about their fuck-ups. I like that
*  That's but that's what makes that's the thing I say is a machine greatness
*  And you know talented people the people that can embrace it. I think transcend I think it's my pain
*  It's just a powerful human quality. Yeah to forgive people
*  Humility is big but also just just being a nice person is so valuable. It's so valuable and I love hugging people man
*  I love see I love one of the things I love most about come to the store or the improv is seeing all my friends
*  I love that we're all in this weird business together, but I've been told I'm too nice
*  I've been told I'm too nice. Fuck told you that man. I'm some asshole. Well, we just got a special and all that
*  That's bullshit. You're too nice. No, you haven't had a special because you concentrated on writing. That's all it is. You're not too nice
*  Yeah, that's all bullshit. That's crazy
*  People but people when things aren't going well, right assholes on the outside come up with solutions. You're too nice
*  I know it's a do different. You just start stealing
*  Right, right
*  Fire your agent
*  There's always some solution that they've got yes, that's a dangerous thing when things aren't going well
*  All you need to do is people yeah
*  All you need to do is you like you listening people even people that are really good people come up with bad solutions
*  Oh, yeah, like my manager my own manager of I've had four I found my manager when I was an open mic er
*  He found me when I was open mic er in Boston. I've had him ever since but in the beginning he wanted me to be clean
*  He's like, yeah
*  You gotta be clean. You gotta be clean clean your act up to get on TV clean your act up
*  But he let it go pretty quickly, but it's also because things aren't going well, right?
*  You know, I have shit going on. Nothing's happening. So people like hmm. How do we make it happen for you?
*  You gotta be clean. You told me I got a dress up nice and be clean. Yeah, two pieces of terrible advice
*  Do you think it's still value in that like
*  Like why don't they have a late-night talk show with comics can just do their actual act
*  It would have to be on the internet
*  The problem is all those goddamn people you're talking about like the same reason why you can never have
*  This fight companion or even this podcast on a network. There was too many people would interfere
*  They would you know, like I have a friend who's an executive and he actually talked to me about, you know
*  There's probably a lot of other things you could do with the show
*  Yeah, you know you could do this and you could do I'm like, hey
*  Hey
*  Stop you never gonna get a job here
*  I'm never gonna you're not gonna come over to the wild side like this is you can't handle this
*  This is not you this is this is the internet is a different thing man
*  The internet is a different thing and if you you involve the internet
*  Yeah, and you try to bring the Hollywood people over the end. They'll just fuck it up. Yeah, they're just ruin it
*  Yeah, so you have any kind of wild-ass late-night talk show you have comics sitting around they'll ruin that
*  You'd have to bring that over here
*  You have to bring it over to the dark side and just let people just get all you need is a conference table and some fucking
*  Cameras and internet connection. Boom. You're on YouTube. I'm doing it. That's all you need
*  In context with Owen Smith, that's why not man. I'll be watching stuff
*  So dude everyone every comic should have yeah a podcast just like every comic has a social media
*  It's really that simple to me. I'm uh
*  I'm getting off of that shit though social media. I'm gonna keep it but I ain't following nobody no no offense
*  it's very addictive unfollowed you this morning, thank you because
*  That's my new thing I tell people to their face yo, I followed you then unfollowed you just very distracting
*  Yeah, it totally is and I'm like god damn or the pictures of my dog
*  Yeah, my dogs right here. I could just pop my fuck. Why am I doing this? So it's a time waster?
*  Yeah, man. So I'm on it y'all can follow me Owen Smith for real whatever
*  No, for real man. I'm trying. Yeah, I'm not I'm not following nobody. I'm trying to get rid of all my Twitter followers like
*  If I know you and I see you I'm gonna engage that way
*  I'm only gonna post stuff that I feel this funny and fun or whatever. It's a good promotional tool
*  That's it. But you have to be worried about the addictive nature of social media. It's very addictive
*  Yeah, it's very hard to like you could when I take a shit in the morning
*  I'll go over my email first see if it's any important like see any funny on Instagram
*  Yeah, and then I'll like little deval always makes me laugh. I go to shit first. He's the best
*  He him and Kyle done again are the best follows on Instagram. It was funny. I was from the Bahamas
*  I was born in the Bahamas. It's so funny, man
*  I'm so I sold a show to ABC and I wrote it and
*  They were asking me like who do you want to star in it?
*  Mmm and the whole network thing I was like
*  Plus I don't even know if he fucking with TV now because his music career is like he's doing so well with performing live
*  It would be a demotion. You know, I mean planes. Yeah. Yes. Yes to planes. Yeah, I know I know
*  But I just think he's so like you trust him
*  Yeah, I'm saying like it's like it's certain like when you see him
*  Yeah, you know his goal is to be funny. Yeah, and you just trust it. Yes
*  I was even though he hasn't quote unquote been number one on the car seat before I was like man
*  This dude would be he would be murderous. This is to be murdered, but it's I knew late. He's free already
*  They passed on the show so I didn't have to go do with the casting thing anyway, but yeah back in my mind
*  I was like man
*  He would be a perfect if you had a show that was produced by people that you respect you
*  Yeah, and like other comics and like really intelligent people that you trusted
*  Yeah, that would be a different experience completely and it would be it would be it wouldn't feel like work
*  Yeah, and it would have to be people whose lives didn't depend on the success of the show important
*  Yes, because you could feel that shit. Yes, you would notes and all of that. Mm-hmm. But again, like I say I
*  Chose to look at it as a challenge as to go. What is this? Let me see how I can you know?
*  What this well it clearly benefits your stand-up writing because yeah you have this your stand-up you have
*  You vary widely in your subjects and you also you you have this approach you have a you have a very
*  comprehensive approach to subjects when you
*  Examine subjects well, you know
*  and I think a lot of that comes from your writing and a lot of that comes from also dealing with network notes and
*  Dealing with executives like there's there's a benefit but the benefit is done. You already got all the good parts of that
*  Yeah, you got a break free of the tit got a break free man. So there it is
*  Text Owen calm you could do so many different things man. All right, I'm gonna do so many different things
*  I'm gonna hit you up if you want to do some gigs with me. I got a bunch of kids
*  I'm announcing a giant tour tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, we just announced it today. Yeah, this come out tomorrow
*  This will come out. Let's come out tomorrow. Yeah tomorrow. Okay, so ha ha good tomorrow meeting today
*  So I'm announcing that's great. Yeah. Yeah. Oh man. Yes. I want to do some guys. Let's do it
*  I'd love to take you out. I would love it. This marinas. Yes
*  What's the biggest place you ever performed at Radio City Music Hall? How many is that Russell Peters?
*  Maybe six thousand. Okay straight up and let me tell you the Comedy Store my training in the Comedy Store prepared me for that
*  yeah, cuz at the
*  Run through I was like, how am I gonna play this because it just goes up, right?
*  When I was on stage the way it set intimately it felt like the ER
*  Really it felt like the ER. So from a technical perspective
*  I just had to stand there and trust the material and then when I would act out something it was so much more effective than
*  The first thing like I gotta work this stage. Oh, yeah
*  I'm saying it's like if I was like couple of you know, just cuz of my building my height
*  I was trying to figure out what's the best way to like connect and some people like to pace
*  Yeah, and pacing is fine, but it's gotta be in you. Yes and and and and
*  Sometimes I pace but but the more I know it the stiller I can get and then I can I can play now
*  I'm playing you know what I mean? So it's like it's just the is the work of it all
*  So when I did Radio City stood there man
*  It was fun as fuck like I love
*  arenas cuz there's no it's um
*  You forget when the drinks are being bought in in the in the tabs are being dropped
*  You don't have that like they're actually just yeah, you're like, oh shit
*  Like it's just a different as he's done one in the round yet. Yeah, that's wild. I can't wait. That's weird
*  You're pacing around. It's fun. I'd be fun as fuck man. Like I just yeah, man. I get chills just thinking of like
*  When I first started when I few auto trains I did then a few arenas not not arenas theaters theaters
*  This is like I'm that I love that shit well especially for your style of comedy to love it
*  You have comedy too. That's got plenty of room to think about what you're saying
*  Yeah, you know and that's what you were in the theater
*  You got to kind of slow things down a little bit because I remember I went to watch Lewis Black me and Joey
*  Yes, watch Lewis Black. He was performing a night before I was okay
*  And we were just we flew in early and Joey was like, let's go across the street
*  Because that was where the theater was and so we got in we sat down and I realized that when he's that maybe the
*  There's a New Jersey might be the theater didn't have the best sound not that New Jersey has bad
*  When he was in his middle of his he was killing
*  I had this big laugh and then he would say a tagline and I couldn't hear the tagline because everybody around me was laughing
*  And then I realized like oh you got to hold these these taglines a little in a place like this
*  Because the laughter is too loud because you actually hear people next to going ha ha ha ha
*  And you can't hear what the fuck he's saying unless the volume so
*  Overwhelming like you've got to know and then on stage
*  It's hard to realize that because there's the monitors and the monitors are you know, you can hear yourself very loudly
*  Yes, but you might not the people in the audience might not be able to hear this clearly. It is a different pacing thing
*  I love it though, man. This is so interesting about that is
*  When you
*  What I like to do sometimes is look at what other acts come to that venue and a lot of times if it's like if it's like
*  You know like jazz ensembles or things where it's not like a lot of laughter
*  Like in that space you got to remember like it's 52 weeks in the year. Maybe four those weeks is us, right?
*  I mean, yeah every time it's like it's dance is all these other things. Yeah, no doing this shit
*  So yeah that the place is even like what the fuck is all this noise like consistent at a rapid?
*  Yeah, so yeah you do it bounces and you got a light just
*  That's different. What's different? What did you what's your thing that you do when people are laughing a lot?
*  You know I'm saying like if they if you got a lot of laughs, you know, so you know some people like to do that
*  fake laugh
*  If I laugh it's because I'm laughing. No, I know I don't have a fake laugh
*  Yeah, I know those who cast take a puff. Yeah, like what's your
*  In the moment man, I stay in the moment. I try to stay in the moment, but I definitely never give off a fake laugh
*  Yeah, if I'm laughing it's because I think it's funny in the moment
*  There's a grossness to fake laughs that I just can't tolerate
*  Yeah, I see guys fake laugh even good comic sometimes I want to go stop
*  I know please stop because sometimes it's funny. Sometimes it really is funny
*  But if you're lying to me you're pretending you think this is hysterical right now
*  You said it 150 times in a row exactly the same way and you pretend like you just realize how funny it is
*  All right
*  Like I had a tagline the other night that I never used before and right after I said I started cracking you out
*  That's the best it came out of nowhere
*  Yeah, cuz I realized like there's a I had a point in the middle of this bit and I said the point and they're like
*  Because it was so ridiculous and it was also real like in the moment I came up with it I ad-libbed
*  I said it on the spot and then I started laughing those are those are real laughs, but I don't hardly ever
*  Laugh along unless I'm really I might be real high
*  Silly
*  Sometimes I'm just you know most the time I'm in the groove right I'm just thinking about what I'm doing
*  I'm just trying to do it my best, but there's times when I'm up there
*  I'm like man. I can't believe I got to do this
*  Can't believe it remember you go back to think about time when you were 19 you're watching Chris and Tony and then think now
*  You know you get to do it in the best comedy clubs in the world. Yeah, and it's just the greatest job on earth
*  It's nothing like it's nothing like it is and so that's bringing back to Malcolm Gladwell, man
*  See you in these comedy streets fan
*  Malcolm I'll pull you up on one of my
*  Right after
*  Yeah, follow me sir
*  Or open that one even uglier. Oh my gosh
*  I was like the goat like for real ask my wife like I couldn't I can't I couldn't listen to him for a minute
*  And that was my man cuz he had these podcasts mm-hmm when he was dissecting stuff, and you know he's a brilliant guy
*  And sometimes brilliant people overestimate their perceptions they they overestimate their their ability to break something down
*  Yes, I mean like I've had conversations with people about fighting that way where people say hey if anybody ever came up to me
*  I would do this and then I would do that like they say that my walker
*  This is a it's hard for me to hear
*  I'm just gonna let you talk because really I want to just tackle you right now
*  But people have this idea cuz a person moves in a way that's similar to the way that they can move they think I could
*  Do that I left weights. I'll fuck that guy up. They have these ideas, and they think oh he's out there talking
*  I'm a brilliant guy. I'm smarter than them. I understand things. I'm I write I'm always performing and cuz I'm always talking about this
*  Stand-up would be easy. I literally yelled. I said Malcolm. What did I do to you?
*  Why you're taking my big man I criticize him I'd have to hear his exact yeah, I got a sanity have we found it
*  He was feeling so it's him and another guy
*  He was talking about jobs that are really hard, and he picked stand-up comedy, and there's a couple quotes that guy
*  Defended stand-up comedy very well. It seems like but is this something that you I couldn't figure out where exactly was it?
*  Somebody else's it was a podcast they did somewhere like an interview, okay?
*  I'm taking out so you saw it in quotes right right. Yeah, can I see the quotes?
*  It wasn't very
*  Okay, so but basically give me your synapses of it then like he thought people were too drunk
*  So it was really easy yes, they're like there was the room was set up for them. They're coming to see them
*  So it's easier. He just doesn't know like he's got a very
*  Like singular he must have been like one or two stand-up shows and it's like oh well. He's right sometimes though
*  He's right sometimes. We've all seen shows where people are laughing at bullshit. I didn't want to I don't hear from him, right?
*  Show and you went on right Jessel neck went on and
*  Diaz maybe Louis CK dropped in right Dave Chappelle did 10 minutes
*  Good fucking luck not having a heart attack
*  Right go go go but he's also right in that we've all seen
*  Mediocre thoughts get passed off in the audience laughs like there's certain clubs
*  I don't want to mention any names
*  But you can go to them any night of the week in Burbank or in North Hollywood
*  You can see locations dog shit comedy and people are laughing they're laughing and it's like real clunky
*  Low rent what if that's the only that's where he was like in those it could be where he was straight B
*  But I mean this is the difference between
*  Talking about any sport right you could watch someone do it poorly on a playground or you could watch someone do it
*  Exquisitely as a professional and you go oh oh here it is
*  Gladwell stated comedians deal with people in a tightly controlled setting
*  That he cannot imagine an easier set of circumstances for navigating a social situation
*  Than that of a stand-up comedian they go to Vegas they go to the comedy seller they control their environments
*  This this is who what is this article that's?
*  Shitting on it was it from Malcolm Gladwell fails stand-up comedy 101
*  Was the person who wrote it
*  This have their name anywhere
*  Really it's the guy is the calm Nathan Timel calm Nathan Timel. Is Nathan a comic?
*  Yeah, well he's right. Yeah, right. Yeah, I mean he's in Malcolm's right in a sense
*  He's right in a sense, but he doesn't understand is there's a mind wrestling that's going on
*  before you actually go and do that and
*  to
*  Sort of diminish the difficulty of that it just shows that you haven't done it. That's what it felt like
*  Yeah, and so I was like
*  Cuz I couldn't I couldn't because he said it in the same exact voice
*  He says everything else in so when he's breaking down something. I really want to hear him. That's it
*  He's so brilliant in so many different ways. I couldn't shake it. I was yeah that 10,000 hours shit
*  Yeah, he wrote outliers right that's him right yes
*  Yeah
*  That that book is amazing what talks about the Beatles and how the the beat like people think the Beatles came out of nowhere
*  Those motherfuckers did thousands and thousands of shows
*  That's what's up. It's just numbers
*  Yeah, it's numbers and concentration and focus and just with that being what you really want. Yeah, you know it's not
*  It's not just numbers. It's numbers of like passion numbers of focus. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
*  He's wrong. He's wrong, but but I get it. I get why he thinks that it's it is a tightly controlled environment
*  But it's so easy to bomb in that tightly controlled environment. That's no idea some dozen a room
*  Some some rooms are tightly controlled environment, but starting we didn't always perform in tightly controlled environment
*  bowling alleys. Oh, yeah backyard bars bars
*  Yeah, yeah like there's so many other spots where you also have to make comedy happen
*  Yeah, and those spaces where there's a big moat between you and the audience
*  I did a jack and jill strip club
*  Jack and jill strip club in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. There's a guy
*  I want to see is you there was a guy named Brian Deary. He used to book these gigs
*  I think still around he used to book these gigs in Rhode Island and some of them were great
*  But occasionally they were terrible and this one as far as I know
*  I think I was the only I think I was a one and done
*  I think I think they killed it after either because there was only like four people in the crowd
*  and I went up and it was a guy and a girl jack and jill strip club is a
*  There's an old concept that didn't really take off where couples would go and a guy would go and strip and the girl would go
*  and strip
*  They both looked like their parents drank while they were in the room
*  They both they're both a terrible tattoos this guy had terrible tattoos and he had them covered with bandanas
*  So it like like bandanas around his arm
*  You can see like the shitty tattoo poking out of the bottom and he wasn't it was built goofy
*  He's building a guy who like lifts weights, but he drinks every night
*  You know, I mean like he wasn't strong pop belly
*  He wasn't like if you go to Vegas and you see those like the men from Down Under there
*  Oh, yeah, there was nothing like that him or her. They're both disgusting
*  They're both disgusting and it was and I'd like to say I bombed but bombing
*  Usually you hear some noise right like people are mad at you
*  It was they were not even recognizing that I was talking
*  So I got off stage and there was like a little pool table in the back
*  And there was a dude who just happened to be in town because his family lived there
*  Because it was around the holidays and his family lived in Rhode Island and he just wanted to get out of the house
*  He came to this local bar and and he and he goes hey, what the fuck is this place?
*  And I go, what are you doing here? And he goes, I'm just here. My fucking family lives around here
*  I just came here because there's nowhere else to go. What the fuck is this place?
*  This is so strange and he and I had a game of pool and we were laughing. It's hilarious
*  Yeah, I'll never forget it. It was so strange. It was so strange
*  That's not a controlled environment those gigs those gigs season you though
*  Yes, you you get you you develop the lacrust. Yes a layer of protection where you could go up in front of those people
*  Yes, and you also know when you get off of those gigs what it's gonna be. Yeah, just by the tone
*  I mean, it's gonna be great. It's always packed. I was okay. All right, where is it again?
*  Sure, but there was something that were always packed
*  There was some gigs and I'd get old-school shitty bar gigs that were fun man
*  Yeah, they were wild they made me because they fed me right those gigs fed me when I was poor
*  But it's it's every situation is different. Like he he basically saw like the Lakers of
*  You know stand up right? I mean and he thinks it looks easy because they make it look easy. Yeah falls into that trap
*  That's all right. Yeah
*  That's like
*  Thinking that someone's making something think it's something's easy because someone's a master. Yes, like like did you ever see that video where?
*  Michael Jordan came out of retirement that didn't come out of retirement, but he had retired
*  But there was a player who had been talking shit about yeah, you saw that. Oh, yeah
*  then they
*  And when Mike came back he he they played one on one one on one
*  But he did it like laughing yes and joking he made it look so easy and then the guy realized like oh oh
*  This levels I do that. I do that sometimes cuz you know what else happens out here
*  We'll be working stuff out. Yes working stuff out
*  So I might not I'm not I'm not in the gear that I would be in of course
*  Yeah, I'm figuring it out and this is a safe space to try to figure it out
*  Yeah, I see some people like you know, whatever he struggled after me
*  I'll be like, all right
*  Put me in front of you and then I would just do your best shit and I and I will make sure I can see
*  They face like while I'm doing
*  That taking the chances look Chris Rock does that better than anybody
*  Yeah, I've seen Chris Rock go on after people killed running killed
*  He gets this giant round of applause and he was relaxed relax. This shit ain't gonna be funny
*  Yeah, this shit is not gonna be that funny. I'm gonna tell you right now. There's all new shit. I'm working out
*  It ain't that good. Yeah, and he'll walk around and joke and laugh and says it's not that good and he'll like bring everybody down
*  Yeah, calm him down and then
*  Purposely fuck around Damon Wayans used to do that too. He's so fun. Damon Wayans is he's one of the unheralded greats
*  He's doing it again. Yeah, he's doing it again, but he's also doing sitcoms again, too
*  Oh, yeah, so yeah, he was gonna do we had actually talked about doing a podcast. He was oh, yeah
*  Yeah, I was there that night. Remember? Yeah
*  But then he's like, you know, don't say anything crazy. Oh, he's got a show and
*  Smoking read some drinks going some ice starts clinking start talking shit
*  Oh, he's got some stories Dan Damon's look he had a joke about magic Johnson way back in the eight in the in the days
*  Where when magic went back to playing when he had HIV? I'll never forget this
*  Who's he was like everybody was afraid to cover magic? He said except for Dennis Rodman
*  Dennis Rodman's like motherfucker. I fuck Madonna. I'll spit in your mouth and accelerate your symptoms
*  To this day as one of the best jokes I ever heard
*  You don't realize how complete Damon is man, he's an animal I got to witness like
*  The stuff he says between the lines is so complete. You know, I mean, he's so fucking good
*  He should be recognized as one of the greatest of all time
*  But he went and did a bunch of TV shows and and while he was doing those TV shows
*  You know, he did clubs and he fucked around a little bit like that
*  But he didn't dedicate to it the same way
*  Maybe cat Williams did or some other guys did that became huge and you know had a bunch of big-time specials in that era
*  But he's always got me though. Yeah, he could still do it right now
*  Damon if you wanted to go on tour and start hitting theaters and start doing a Netflix special he would blow people away
*  Destroyed he was one of the people that showed me it was it was okay to be tall and funny. Oh, that's hilarious
*  You know, I mean like we've talked about this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's true
*  And he's and he was cool. He was cool. Yeah, but then he could get goofy. He was so man
*  He was silly, but a goddamn great writer
*  Yeah, great writer great performer and part of one of the great look there's two greatest sketch
*  Well, there's a couple other ones that are it but for pound for pound funny
*  There's in living color and number one is Chappelle show
*  That Chappelle shows number one because it only really lasted two years, right?
*  And still this day has some of the most legendary sketches of all time Clayton Bigsby
*  One of the most legendary sketches of all time all the Rick James shit
*  Oh
*  Legendary legendary but in living color in that era. Oh my god that era that was the show for that era
*  Yeah, and Damon was a giant part of that and Keenan and it was stuff you had to see yeah
*  Race home to see you couldn't yeah, but Damon somewhere along the line
*  Look at the world was a different place back then but he had decided that he was gonna do movies
*  Remember he was in the last Boy Scout with Bruce Willis. He was a movie star. He was doing action movies
*  Yeah, you know and then he got that sitcom
*  He did that sitcom for a long time and the problem with sitcoms is they give you that juicy check every week
*  Oh, if you're a famous guy who's the lead of a sitcom like
*  Guys like Kevin James you never have to work again ever ever for life
*  You get that juicy check that juicy the show went for six years check like oh boy
*  That's the you don't have to do nothing. Yeah, it's a trap to trap for someone who's a great comic. Yeah
*  Because at the end of the day it's never gonna be as good as doing stand-up
*  It's never gonna feels good
*  There's a thing about when it pop there's a thing about when when you hear a dude pop in the in the main room like
*  You're in the back green room when you hear
*  Open the door and lean in like what's going on?
*  That's my favorite does my in my professional life
*  Yeah out of all the things I've done whether it's a USC or podcasts or TV shows
*  That the pop of someone murdering at a club where you're hanging out and you watch someone just destroying
*  Joey Diaz did this bit about Terry Crews that they cut out of his Netflix special what yeah, yeah
*  It was too risky. It was crazy
*  Netflix was like fuck you it was it because it was a me too thing and it was but it was basically
*  Saying that like it was basically mocking Terry Crews like it was Terry Crews threatened
*  He's a goddamn fucking super athlete like Terry Crews is a massive man
*  Yeah, I mean the idea that some agent touching his dick was actually terrifying is so ridiculous
*  But Joey Diaz had this bit about you shouldn't have done that underwear commercial
*  Unfortunately, but that bit me and and and Santino we were in the back of the
*  Or literally we couldn't stay in the chair. We were on the ground
*  We were just clinging to the table just hanging on and Joey's screaming and his sweats flying off of him and he's beat-read
*  Those are my favorite moments in life when someone hits those pops you don't get those pops when you do a sitcom
*  You get a lot of money you get everybody making you bagels. It's real. It's wonderful. You got a parking spot
*  But it's it's a it's a velvet prison. Do you think your insecurity rises when you are?
*  Being coddled and treated like that mine does. Yeah, I was wondering. Yeah mine does I got fortunate in that when I did fear factor
*  I never stopped doing stand-up and never stopped. I was always at the store always
*  I was scared because I fucked up during news radio when I was on news radio
*  I went for a long stretch where I was barely doing stand-up because we were long hours when a sitcom is
*  First getting trying to figure it out. It's like 12 hour days. It's long
*  I would do sets but I wasn't writing any new material and then I had a
*  Writer one of the writers and one of the producers came to see me and I ate shit
*  Whoa bombed hard in the main room like a late show on a Friday night
*  Friday or Saturday, I ate shit. Yeah, I tanked I was so nerdy and I see them
*  They were real close to like fourth row and like oh my god
*  This is embarrassing and it was only like maybe 30 people in the whole crowd this tiny crowd
*  In the back like this is who you hire he was already killing everybody loves Raymond by then he was happy but
*  And Ray was a friend of mine still is but it was I was happy that I didn't take his job
*  I took the job of the dude who took his job. Okay, it was like, okay
*  Okay, but when when I did that I realized okay, I'm fucking off here
*  I'm just doing this sitcom and I'm not I'm losing the thing that I love. I'm not good anymore
*  Like guys I sucked. Yeah, and then a year later. I wound up doing my Warner Brothers special my Warner Brothers CD
*  I really got my shit together again. I really did I started doing multiple sets around town
*  I started writing a lot more. I started really taking it seriously because I realized like you can't do that
*  You can't fall apart. You can't know you can't just start bombing. No, man
*  No, man, but you get soft man
*  You can get soft and they were making me soft to like one of the producers was like why you still doing stand-up?
*  You're an actor now. Oh
*  But that's what everybody wanted even Seinfeld took time off he did he did Seinfeld and stopped doing stand-up
*  Yeah, a lot of people got brought into that trap
*  Yeah, you know, it's hard. It's hard to get hired as a writer too because it's almost
*  I'm learning it's almost like
*  The difference between improv cats and stand-up cats, right? So if you're a writer if that's what you do you write then
*  They may feel they may have a certain bias or feel a certain type of way to
*  It's a comic that writes. Mm-hmm
*  Okay, it's like you deal with it everywhere and it's like but a budget basically always leave
*  Always and you always have and you have you basically you're sitting in a room and you got you got two jobs
*  You know I'm saying so it's like we got this job, but I'm also gonna do this other job
*  Yeah, nobody won't be nobody will one job was to sit next to somebody with two jobs. I
*  Totally get it, you know what I mean is there actually with comedy because their comedies kind of unproven
*  Yeah, like they think they're funny. Why but how do you know you're funny? How do you really know? I've always wondered that
*  I was like that's a courageous thing. That is so courageous, right?
*  You're a comedy writer and you don't even perform like how do you know if it's funny? Like who told you you're funny?
*  I know who told you are you sure Malcolm Gladwell?
*  I
*  Really want to listen to him again, so I need I need I need we need to talk man
*  He's right. He's wrong if he was here right now
*  He would I'm sure he would see our perspective right and then I could listen to him again cuz I miss it
*  He's right though in certain ways. He's right. It's a very controlled environment
*  That's still what he saw but you know what else I read an article by another guy
*  He is a thing that's happening to people who aren't that strong in comedy
*  Are writing articles about comedy, you know, I mean like in in national
*  Comic I've seen him he's not
*  Why they speaking for us, yeah, and you're like
*  Comedians are not a model is like you like oh, I read this article
*  This woman wrote about men not being funny and I've seen her act talking about forcing men to eat her pussy
*  And it's one of the the worst bits I've ever seen in my life. This is hilarious
*  But yet she
*  Was able to write that thing on that platform
*  And it's like an amazing thing that's happening like everybody's a pundit everybody's in kind of well
*  If there's money to be made in clicks, you know, that's what it is
*  If you can especially if you're writing an article like shitting on someone who's done something wrong like Louis CK or someone else or Aziz
*  I'm sorry someone who's gotten in trouble, right?
*  You go after them and they know that like that's why the pylon happens because it gets people attention
*  It's a very profitable lucrative venture is very yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of people writing
*  Stories or articles about comedy where they're they're dismissive. They don't
*  Then don't really truly understand what they're talking about. Yeah, it's like so many gaps
*  You know, what's this and yeah, all that stuff annoys me and
*  I
*  Don't carry it much but it was so funny because when I sat here I was like, oh, yeah, Malcolm Clabo sat here
*  About him
*  Jerry Seinfeld did something like that one time too. He was on like HBO
*  Talking to Bob Costas about comedy. I'm like, why is this happening? And he said and Jerry said I don't know who the next people are
*  These young comedians don't study
*  That's a great offense. They don't study. He said they don't study. What does that mean?
*  He said he said they don't know they don't study the craft, you know, or they don't know
*  You know, I guess who who came before them or whatever general generalizations like that are so crazy to say so here's so
*  so I'm at Hermosa Beach Comedy Magic Club and Jimmy Brogan who I call like the
*  Comic whisperer like he goes, you know Jerry's performing you want to come come down? Of course
*  So I go watch Jerry perform and then he invites me in the green room and when I see Jerry I couldn't help myself
*  I go hey, man
*  You can't be going on TV saying comedians don't study he goes, I know you hey man, whatever man
*  Cuz I study you can't do that. You you're dismissing a whole generation people listen to you. Yeah, he goes. All right, man
*  Fine
*  And I looked to my left is Jay Leno is like Kevin Neal and it's like all these heavy hitters
*  But I just saw him. Yeah and just had to pay yo, what are you doing? Yeah
*  You know, you're right, but sometimes people say things you're just talking I don't even know if they have a point
*  They just hoping they get formulated as they're talking
*  You're right and he was right to let it go
*  He was so chill. He was like, yeah. All right, man
*  That was easy Mark Norman who's a friend of mine. Yeah, he's with him. He says he's great. He said Jerry's a great guy
*  I believe it man. Yeah, and he just well he stills doing it and he's got
*  500 million dollars in the bank and he's still doing it dude. He's been doing it well
*  He's always working on it. He like still does it. Yeah, he still does it like legitimately
*  He's basically he's one of those guys that did what you're telling me to do
*  You gotta you gotta trust it all the way
*  And you just gotta just do it cuz something when you say how do I write some days when I went all I do is write
*  Calm and I go cat damn why don't I do this all the time? Yeah, I take I could take my bitch
*  So yes, you know and it's the best and you know how you said that you're consistently inconsistent
*  Yeah, oh, yeah, that's a that's a hallmark of a funny person. It's a strange thing
*  Like most comics are we're very impulsive crazy people, right?
*  You know, you know, we don't necessarily have discipline, you know
*  I'm just very fortunate that I was involved in something else before comedy that required discipline
*  Because your fucking physical health is on the line like it had to have discipline
*  I was gonna get my brains kicked in so like that transfer it over to stand up
*  But it's so easy to fuck off man when I come home from the comic store and it's late at night a lot of times
*  I just want to go to sleep. Yeah, I don't want to do anything. I want to watch TV
*  I want to fuck off, but I sit in front of that goddamn laptop. I sit in front of that laptop
*  I'll spark a joint. I'll go outside a spark a joint. That's the best punch there at the stair at the sky
*  Yeah, come back inside and stare at that laptop and then I'll start writing and I'll force myself
*  I said I'm gonna do one hour
*  Maybe I'll do more than one hour, but I'm definitely gonna do one hour and I set a timer
*  That's the best punch up never tell you my Mitch Hedberg story. Which one I did ask it with him
*  Well when I was 26, so I'm a store. Yeah, man. So me and Mitch
*  met at the Chicago Comedy Festival and
*  We clicked right and we walk around was living in Chicago at the time and we walked around he was like, you know
*  Oh
*  I'm about to be rich man
*  Deal or whatever in Montreal. I couldn't get my show to like look at me
*  But I he had just crushed in Montreal. He goes I'm about to be rich man. He pulls out this velcro while it was
*  And goes you see this ring. I
*  live in Seattle
*  He's the pawn this ring so I could eat
*  And then I would go eat and get a gig and then buy it back
*  I'm gonna have to do that no more so you just sound some big deal
*  So he needed a shirt for his
*  HBO half-hour special the one when he's sitting on the steps
*  Mm-hmm, and so I I helped him pick out that shirt and then I had a gig in Minnesota
*  Like after the festival he goes can I ride with you?
*  So we road trip to Minnesota because he was from st
*  Paul I spent a night in his in his home and that's me
*  I learned he was like a chef and all that stuff. So we really clicked and we were bumping to each other on the road
*  we're in Houston and
*  He goes when I decided I wanted to do comedy I
*  Hit acid
*  You know I took a hit of acid. I got my notebook and everything I saw I wrote
*  and I was like it won't be funny like that so I did acid with him and
*  And we're both in this hotel like it was the woman
*  It was a woman who was a dealer and she came over and you know
*  We'll be in the hotel room
*  And that's when I learned where cartoons come from like everything I saw was like a fucking cartoon and I was tripping man
*  And he videotaped me
*  Tripping and I'm going why is a a why is B B?
*  Why is the letter green who said who said the like and I was doing these videotape me he literally goes
*  I clearly remember going
*  You should do this on stage
*  Like I'm like scatting man right go and I'm seeing on this thing and then like I started
*  I
*  Was on this whole thing like all I kept thinking about was pussy right and I saw and I was dating this girl and
*  This is back when you use a calling card
*  My mom's number in hers and I was like I prayed that I'm calling the girl
*  As I was talking to her on the phone and I was on the bed
*  I was like I want your pussy like all that shit. Are you high?
*  You know just fucking up the whole thing and I go yeah
*  Don't don't do anything don't jump and I was like why you putting that shit in my head like cuz whatever
*  I could see like I could physically see it and then I look over in the bed
*  Next to me and Mitch is like fucking the girl that bought the
*  Oh shit, I'm in the orgy, but not really
*  I
*  Want the phone he's actually doing
*  And then like my body started shaking and the whole shit like left my my body
*  So that's how like you know that was my my experience
*  I never did it again never desired to do it again, but I did it with Mitch and it was like it was like this crazy
*  thing and
*  so we used to
*  We would do colleges
*  separate of one another and we will leave each other notes and shit, you know and
*  He would be like kill it man or whatever and once I was doing some college and butt fuck
*  Pennsylvania no
*  It was somewhere in Pennsylvania. He had just done and that's what I learned about him passing like I was literally
*  Reading his note when I heard about the heroin shit
*  Reading the note that he wrote me when the news broke like did you hear about Mitch and it was like
*  Yeah, man, yeah, man, yeah me and Stan hope we're on the side
*  We were that's right. Y'all did a show together. Yeah when we found out that he was I was at his wedding
*  No
*  Vegas I was whatever happened in Vegas. I was in that one. I was there. This is like many years ago. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah
*  Doing yeah
*  Didn't know I could say that to him I was I think I was in Vegas independent
*  I was like but we were cool. So I was there like this is crazy. Yeah, right after he was married
*  It's something happened where his girlfriend mouthed up to a cop and they bounced her head off the hood and arrested her
*  Oh Jesus, bro. Yeah
*  Anyway, we found out that Mitch had been
*  Brought to the hospital and they thought he was gonna lose his leg
*  You've been shooting into this one same area and he got gangrene
*  Goddamn and then he got free of that and and he healed up
*  But he went right back to it. He would not you know, he didn't have any desire to kick heroin
*  It's really interesting like yeah, I'm not and they call me the naive detective
*  Like I never knew that he did that because whenever I saw him we were working out
*  He we would always go to the gym. He was mad competitive like he would run the treadmill
*  Really? Yeah, he was like
*  He was competitive like he would he'd like me to open for him because he liked to work like he was like, mm-hmm
*  He didn't want me to hold back. He's like go man, like I
*  just
*  That's the side that I saw of him and then
*  When he had to deal with the show and all of that shit
*  He would do material about it because it's it's such a different
*  experience than from what he
*  Is you know?
*  Dealing with the notes of it all and all that shit. He was like, you know a pitch an idea
*  I wanted to do this idea and it became like yeah, the dream is not the reality
*  Yeah, you know, but the dream his dream was his stand-up to this day
*  I'll still like I like to listen to his stand-up when I'm on my way to the airport because it's like stressful
*  It's like but his staff was so silly. So silly. So silly, you know, so
*  My favorite joke is banana joke somebody asked me do I want a frozen banana I said no
*  But I want a regular banana later. So yes
*  He had so much of that that was great I just enjoyed that it was very silly and I didn't you know, I don't I
*  Don't know what?
*  When he got into the heroin, I don't know when but yeah, I never know
*  It's so crazy like I mean I knew he did his thing but I think
*  People like people just never did that shit in front of me, right?
*  No one ever did it in front of me either, but I knew they were doing it
*  I had a buddy mine in New York that died from it. Wow. He was snorting it
*  Yeah, but he got into pills and a lot of this. That's what a lot of times they find out about oxys and yeah
*  They snort pills and it's just opioids
*  It's just I mean that crisis is something that just swept through the entire world and so many people are dying from that shit
*  Yeah, man
*  I've never done it but I did I did get a morphine drip once when I had my knee fixed
*  He was like I kept hitting that button
*  Just made you feel like like the world was filled with love just caressing you everything was
*  Like a womb feeling protected. You're safe. You're gonna be okay amazing
*  which makes sense that a lot of musicians and a lot of people wanted that because so many people that are like really
*  Super creative or they're they're kind of in pain a lot of those people are like they're like
*  when you when you think of
*  Nirvana you think of Kurt Cobain the screaming all that like this that's coming from a place of pain, right?
*  Yeah, and then that dude would go off and do heroin. Mm-hmm
*  Well, I'm glad you're not doing heroin Owen nah fam I was always you know, you know, then he bias
*  passing of
*  cocaine overdose scared me from doing anything because
*  He was all muscle. Yeah, and I was like if cocaine could take him down
*  I don't stand a chance and like I've never had a six-pack this dude
*  I'm made, you know I'm saying so super athlete when that happened like that's my brain was like, oh this shit ain't for me
*  It's so weed I do
*  I did mushrooms once shit my pants
*  On this dude's white couch, oh no, I
*  Seemly think I never liked that guy. He was a he was like a asshole to me. I just purpose just
*  Shit on this dumb white couch white carpet
*  Oh
*  Alright man. See ya
*  We gotta wrap this up man. It's three o'clock
