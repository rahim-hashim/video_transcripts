# Joe Rogan Experience #1372 - Kevin Smith
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 29, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yji9vIxkwY)
*  Headphones?
*  Do I need them?
*  I like them.
*  I'm in.
*  Just to gauge my own voice.
*  You don't need them.
*  We can not have them.
*  We only need Collins, right?
*  No, no.
*  No, we don't need them.
*  I like how you're mocking me with that marijuana.
*  Come on, man.
*  Just open.
*  It's your sober October.
*  Yes, I know, man.
*  It's my un-sober lifetime.
*  When was the last time you were sober?
*  How many days have you ever done it?
*  What a great question.
*  Let me see.
*  When was the last time?
*  Somewhere I was on the road.
*  I couldn't get my hands on weed.
*  Probably when I was in London or something like that.
*  That's usually an overseas thing.
*  I went two days.
*  It's like I did my time, man.
*  It felt like, oh, I get it.
*  I remember what this was like.
*  But why bother?
*  Post heart attack, I feel like I'm living on borrowed time anyway.
*  I'm like, well, I'm going to spend that time as well as I possibly can.
*  And generally in a THC drenched condition, this is not a brag and I'm not like, kid,
*  you should try this at home.
*  But I only am not ingesting when I sleep.
*  So I wake, bake.
*  All day.
*  Is there anything?
*  Don't say it like that.
*  The way you're like, all day.
*  Like, judgy.
*  I'm not judgy.
*  I mean, just because it's sober October, you'd be joining me right now.
*  I would.
*  But I'm always like, smoke this member November.
*  I'm always in awe of people who do go 24 seven.
*  I think really, because I only do it because I thought you did.
*  I was trying to impress you.
*  What am I out here alone?
*  I always had the I was under the impression you too.
*  I know you do a lot more and shit.
*  Well, let's talk about that real quick.
*  I get to interview you for sure.
*  You know, I've been in here in jumps and spurts.
*  And those jumps and spurts, you have become like the most powerful fucking broadcaster
*  on the planet.
*  Like crazy, popular everywhere.
*  You can crack a smile.
*  You know I'm writing shit.
*  Well, it's don't don't go hard on me.
*  No, it's weird.
*  Why?
*  Because it's well, can't you enjoy it?
*  Come on, motherfucker.
*  I wanted to like my whole life.
*  I wanted to be at the top of something.
*  Really?
*  You are at it.
*  I was the top of podcast for like a minute back when we started and shit back in the
*  old fleshlight days.
*  Like you are now beyond you've transcended the fucking medium.
*  You got to tell me it.
*  Don't wince.
*  You got to tell me it feels good.
*  Otherwise, what am I striving for in my career?
*  And to be honest, I don't really strive if you've seen the shit I do.
*  But like there is an idea of like, you know, oh man, at the top, it must be amazing.
*  And like no bullshit.
*  You're absolutely the top.
*  You fucking Snowden on your podcast, dude.
*  Everything feels exactly the same but different.
*  Explain.
*  It's still fun.
*  I still enjoy talking to people like you.
*  And I had my friend Kyle Kalinsky on earlier.
*  I've had some really interesting people on.
*  I love I've always enjoyed talking to interesting people.
*  So that's the same.
*  Everything's the same in that regard.
*  It's different in that it's it's very obvious when I go places that it's having more of
*  an impact because you're the same person, right?
*  But the world changes like the impact you put out the signal and the world sort of changes
*  and shifts.
*  More lovers, more haters, more this, more that.
*  It's everything just increases.
*  It becomes more.
*  Yeah.
*  It becomes more.
*  It becomes it becomes weird.
*  People want to interview you.
*  People want to do things and I don't do any of those things.
*  Let me tell.
*  Can I tell a quick story?
*  Because I don't want I never want to cut you off because you I could listen to you.
*  You're just a shame and you're a guru.
*  I love coming here and I have loved coming here.
*  But now there's this different onus to it because it's like I'm going to use my time
*  wisely.
*  Fucking Bernie Sanders is next.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's it's it's nice.
*  But this is how authentic Rogan is.
*  So we're making Jane, Silent Bob reboot.
*  And I reach out to like everybody I know about being in the movie.
*  And you know, even the people that are like, oh, man, I don't want to go to New Orleans.
*  That's far.
*  I'm like, you do remember I almost died of a fucking heart attack.
*  Like, all right, I'm coming.
*  I guilted like everybody in the coming.
*  So Jordan, who's our producer, Jason uses wife.
*  She runs our company.
*  He's like, I reach out to Joe's manager and he says, I understand.
*  I was like, you know what?
*  Let me handle this.
*  Like, I'll reach out to Joe.
*  I got Joe on direct.
*  I don't need a manager, man.
*  Some 10 percent are fucking get between me and my boy and shit.
*  So I fucking email their text to Joe and I was like, hey, man, we're making reboot.
*  Do you want to come play and just flat out on Front Street as true as it could be?
*  He goes, I hate that acting shit that you wrote.
*  And you were like, I'm flattered, but I don't want to do that.
*  He's like, I'll talk to you about it when it's done.
*  I was like, all right.
*  That's how authentic you are.
*  That's you know, you're in a place right now where you're like, can't fucking ruin my credibility
*  with shit like it's not a ruin the credibility.
*  What is it?
*  I don't like doing it.
*  It takes too much time.
*  I don't have a critical.
*  That is not.
*  And that was not me going.
*  Look, I thought it was fantastic.
*  I thought it was adorable.
*  Honestly, I was trying to do less.
*  Why? Tell me why.
*  Because I do too much.
*  I'm doing, you know, between all the podcasts that I do doing commentary for the UFC, doing
*  standup comedy, there's a lot of things.
*  There's three things you've been doing for the last fucking decade, bro.
*  It's not like they've all increased, perhaps.
*  Like I don't I'm not in the fighting world.
*  So I don't know if your your jobs there have exponentially increased.
*  I knew you were.
*  No, I've actually cut that back a lot.
*  And the more I've cut that back, the more I cut things back, the happier I am.
*  And then stand up has that.
*  Stand up is not cut back at all.
*  So this is increased.
*  This has increased quite a bit.
*  Yeah.
*  And so the idea like I'm doing six podcasts this week and then I'm flying to New York
*  on Thursday and then I'm doing Artie Lang on Friday in New York.
*  So that would be a seventh podcast.
*  We're going to carry that one over to the next week.
*  But that's just that does not leave any room for trips to New Orleans to do a movie.
*  No, it doesn't leave any room to do anything.
*  I get all these weird requests to do things that just are not interesting.
*  I don't want I don't want to do them.
*  And yours is one of the most interesting.
*  I know.
*  Believe me, I'm not building on your spot going like, why didn't you come?
*  I don't have time.
*  It was the most on brand fucking response.
*  And it was also a lesson in like, let me let me reach out.
*  This manager knows nothing in the matter.
*  Do exactly.
*  My manager is a rare thing.
*  She knows exactly how I feel about everything.
*  So he doesn't.
*  You know, I just I say no to everything, man.
*  I don't want to do anything.
*  You and I started podcasting roughly around the same time.
*  And it never occurred to me when I started.
*  And I wonder if it occurred to you to do seasons.
*  No.
*  Right.
*  Once you just turned on the machine, the machine just kept going.
*  And there's this there's an agaping mall.
*  How do you tell an audience that's used to access all the time?
*  Like, we're going to do it in a clip and then take a bunch of time off and stuff.
*  Right.
*  No, like a television show has seasons.
*  Yeah.
*  And they seem to do that.
*  Like, I remember when serial had like, hey, we're this many and we're done.
*  I'm like, oh, I never thought of that.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a novel approach.
*  That's a corporate approach.
*  Right.
*  I mean, they have a well, it's like the same type of people that would put together a television
*  show.
*  I mean, that's their approach as the approach that someone who was doing something along
*  those lines and then transitioned into podcasting.
*  That's how they would approach it.
*  The way they would approach a Netflix show or an HBO show or whatever it is.
*  Have you encountered a bunch of that?
*  Again, you've been in the space for quite some time now podcasts.
*  Of course, it's crazy crowded.
*  Everybody does it.
*  But the business, my industry or the industry that I sometimes work in use podcasting like
*  proof of concept now.
*  So you go into some place with a pitch for a TV show and they're like, hmm, maybe why
*  don't you try it out as a podcast?
*  Really?
*  That's what's happening a lot.
*  I met somebody who was a friend of mine who worked at Miramax with me back in the day.
*  She's gone on, she's producing, she put together a podcast package where she took it to a TV
*  network and the TV network wasn't interested.
*  And she was like, this is a good concept, man.
*  I'm going to sell it.
*  And I think they sold it to like I Heart or something like that.
*  Six figure thing.
*  It was like 100 grand.
*  I'm like, they're paying 100 grand for podcasts now.
*  And they're like, no, no, that's just what that person got paid to bring in that show.
*  It's a big, big, crazy industry.
*  And so I've been looking for like the last year and going like, well, clearly he must
*  be approached on the regular to do this for somebody.
*  And clearly every time you're like, why would I bother?
*  Like I could do exactly what I want.
*  I've definitely been approached a few times.
*  Had to be like as I've watched the star rise and rise.
*  I'm like, oh my God, like nobody snatched them up yet.
*  And then I realized, of course you've been there've been overtures.
*  But of course, like you kind of, you've for those who've never been in this place,
*  it's like, why would you slap a logo on it?
*  It's your own.
*  You built your own fucking thing from scratch.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm pretty outside of the Hollywood thing now.
*  You know, I don't really, but there's, but there's a market for outside of the Hollywood
*  thing.
*  There is some company that would be like, we will pay you.
*  And I suspect you've been offered crazy fucking money and had the integrity to be like,
*  no, I still like what I'm doing.
*  I like this.
*  I'm not changing shit.
*  I mean, it would have to be crying, but I don't have to.
*  That's so punk.
*  I got so indie film.
*  That's so like, like you get it.
*  A lot of people like built their ships and then instantly tried to sell them.
*  And this was one thing that like you and I get emotional about this shit.
*  You and I like, we're there for the beginning of something.
*  Yeah.
*  We weren't there for the beginning.
*  Stand up.
*  You're great at it.
*  You weren't there.
*  We'll maybe there for the beginning of USC and shit, but like podcasting was something like
*  you were there for the beginning of, I was there for the beginning of, and now it's saturated.
*  We were first wave.
*  There was a couple of guys before me, like Corolla was before me.
*  I was before I go for a Marin and Adam Curry.
*  Adam Curry is the absolute first.
*  He's the pod father.
*  He's the number one.
*  He creates it.
*  Yeah.
*  And, uh, you had him on here.
*  No, I have not.
*  I don't know him.
*  I know, but where does he live?
*  No idea.
*  I think about it.
*  You like podcasting changed your life.
*  Talk to the guy who was the first guy that was like, I think this is a good idea.
*  He named it.
*  You were last time I was talking to you.
*  I was like, you gotta get McCauley, coconut.
*  And you did.
*  He was great.
*  Wasn't he?
*  Fantastic.
*  He's such a trip.
*  I got another catch for you.
*  Okay.
*  Is good.
*  And it's gonna sound promotional, but it kind of is, but at the same time it isn't.
*  But I want to tell this dude's stories, but like, uh, there's a company called
*  Caviar Gold makes weed.
*  I know it's sober October.
*  Uh, they make our weed.
*  So why don't we have a couple more days?
*  Uh, oh, you're gonna, I'm gonna leave you with this and you're going to be in heaven.
*  This is a sativa.
*  You're going to be able to have this snoozy booties is a sativa.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  Pumped up with CBD.
*  Yeah.
*  Pre-rolls.
*  So I took the first row.
*  That'd be fair.
*  Like I smoked to myself.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  That's the sativa.
*  That's the wake up weed.
*  You smoke that.
*  You're ready to like clean house, record podcasts.
*  It's also pumped up with CBDs.
*  My man, Mike at caviar controls.
*  He's like swamp thing.
*  He controls the plant.
*  He works with distillates so he could take your weed, make a super weed.
*  So that's, that's the sativa.
*  It's, it smells like, tell me what it smells like.
*  It smells like a heart attack.
*  No, man.
*  It smells like maple.
*  I said, uh, he goes, what do you want it to smell?
*  It tastes like I said breakfast.
*  Oh, it does smell like maple.
*  You got to get it right up there.
*  It smells like one of them McDonald's McGriddles.
*  Yes.
*  Yes, bitch.
*  It's like smoking a McGriddle.
*  How'd they do that?
*  He's a genius.
*  This was a dude who was like, I couldn't get high off weed anymore.
*  I had to figure out how to make weed better so I could get high off it.
*  That's the sativa.
*  And he's, he's going to be a billionaire, man.
*  But you got to have him on the show, dude, because his story is like fascinating.
*  His weed growing story.
*  How he got to this place in life.
*  Like, uh, it made me want to be in business with him.
*  I was like, this guy's like, he's got a movie in him.
*  So that's the sativa.
*  This is the indica and this shit is like deep on the THC.
*  It's called snoogins.
*  This is indica.
*  Yes.
*  This is a ghostly queen.
*  You're going dark.
*  So this is like 45% THC right here.
*  Smoke 45%.
*  Yes.
*  Oh my God.
*  What in the fuck, man?
*  It's amazing.
*  I smoked this with be real and I watched them go down hard.
*  Be real went down.
*  You took be real down.
*  I did the smoke box.
*  I've moved the longest episode ever.
*  And then this is the hybrid and the hybrid is called berserker.
*  I'm going to leave you guys at these three boxes.
*  As soon as sober October is done.
*  Oh my good smoke them, give them out.
*  The guy who we do the weed with.
*  I've been smoking his weed for like two years.
*  This caviar gold weed.
*  I love it.
*  It's insane.
*  It's the weed you smoke if you're a stoner and you want to get stoned.
*  So I hit them up because we got in percent 45%.
*  So what did it used to be?
*  It'll change.
*  It's like werewolf weed.
*  It'll change you 20.
*  What it used to be.
*  I mean, if you, you know, most pre-rolls you go buy an expensive pre-roll 20 to 25.
*  What is it like when you go to England and you take two days off?
*  What is that feeling?
*  You sit there and go like, boy, everything sure is crisp.
*  Does it need to be?
*  It's not bad.
*  It's not like I'm Jones and I'm pounding tables.
*  I don't have that kind of relationship with it,
*  but it is kind of like, you know, like remember I wore a hockey jersey forever.
*  Mm hmm.
*  You know, a lot of people were like, you don't want to wear something else.
*  I'm like, I'm, I'm, you know, I've been married for like 20 years.
*  Like I dig in.
*  Once something works for me, I stick with it.
*  Went vegan, still vegan, you know, like never really altered since that happened and stuff.
*  So you did that post heart attack, right?
*  Post heart attack.
*  After right at the day after the heart attack, because my kid made me, my kid was like,
*  she'd been vegan for a couple of years and she was like scared because she'd never been
*  through anything real first world kid, wonderful kid, but like no tragedies in life and shit
*  like that.
*  We, you know, we do well.
*  Are you getting regular blood worked on?
*  I just went and saw my doctor.
*  What is it?
*  Two months ago, Dr. Leidenheim and did the stress test where, you know, you're on the
*  treadmill and you go up and stuff and then they take all the blood and he was like,
*  whatever you're doing, keep doing it.
*  It's amazing.
*  He said, I can see your heart because they take pictures of your heart.
*  He's like, I know where the heart attack was.
*  So I know exactly where to look.
*  He's going, if I didn't know where to look, you would never tell.
*  He's like, right now there's no lasting damage.
*  Keep going.
*  So I hike running in every day, nice vegan out like a year and a half ago because of the kid.
*  And, and haven't really strayed back.
*  So I'm all plant based and I intermittent faster.
*  I don't eat breakfast anymore.
*  I'm not going to be like breakfast is propaganda, but it kind of is.
*  You don't really need to eat that early in the day, particularly, you know what?
*  That's untrue.
*  Thin people maybe do guy my size certainly didn't need to be eating breakfast.
*  Could have skipped a few meals.
*  I do the same.
*  It's no 16 hours off.
*  That's the way to break the fast.
*  Do you pick a time or is it as deep as you can go?
*  Just eight and 16, you know, I just do it based on what's the soonest you eat then.
*  Generally speaking, it depends, but I've gone, I've gone as late as like one, two in the
*  afternoon.
*  Yeah.
*  That's why I try to make it till noon, the earliest and like by two, I'm ready.
*  I'm ravenous.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's totally doable.
*  Your body gets really used to it too.
*  What I generally do is I get up in the morning, I'll have a cup of coffee and then I work out.
*  And either I run or I do yoga or do something, whatever I do is pretty intense.
*  And then I do podcasts generally around noon.
*  That's when I start the day.
*  And so I've already been up for hours and hours and sometimes I don't even eat.
*  Until after the podcast, sometimes they'll eat it like three.
*  Have you gone days where you don't eat at all?
*  No, I've done that.
*  I burn off too many cowards.
*  I think you also work out every day.
*  I just have the hike and stuff, but I love days where I can totally skip all the way
*  down because the body is still feeding off of like, yeah, stored energy and stuff like
*  that.
*  But, but I'm also, you know, I'm on I'm WW guy ambassador.
*  So that made like my reduced eating made like staying on points like insanely easy.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  I knew you, are you just maintaining now?
*  Are you trying to continue?
*  Now maintaining like I'm on the road for the next like 60.
*  Well, we have 63 dates with James, Silent Bob reboot.
*  We've just been in Jersey, Chicago, Detroit, Grand Rapids, St. Paul, St. Louis, Columbus
*  as the first leg.
*  And now we go to Texas and stuff.
*  We're doing that for like 60.
*  Is this a publicity tour?
*  We're just touring the movie rather than like, I will put the movie out in thousand theaters.
*  We don't have that kind of marketing money.
*  So instead me and Jay are just touring with the movie.
*  So essentially it's like a comedy tour or like a small punk band tour.
*  We go to a theater, we set up shop, we sold tickets in advance.
*  A lot of the tours sold out, reboot road show.com for tickets.
*  And we intro the movie, watch the movie with them and then hang out afterwards, Q and A
*  and shit like that.
*  And for me, it's like, you know, it's pretty grueling schedules every day in a different
*  city.
*  But every day I get to like sit and watch the movie with the exact audience who's made for
*  something like walking into a multiplex that's playing your movie.
*  And even if it's crowded, you're like, man, I hope all these cats get every joke and stuff.
*  This is the crowd the movie was made for.
*  So every reference, every joke like lands, man, you feel like a genius.
*  I sit in the back of the room and watch the back of their heads like a dirty little cuck
*  at every screening, man, just ready to fuck a jerk off.
*  I'm so happy with myself.
*  I'm like, I'm so clever listening to them laugh.
*  It's, you know, it's like stand up, but like with the movies.
*  Right, right, right.
*  And, you know, it's it's we've just taken the movie and kind of eventized it by being
*  like, hey, man, come watch it with us because you do that.
*  That's very cool.
*  And in a world where people would come see me and Jay anyway, talk about the old movies
*  like and pay 50 to 100 bucks.
*  We're like, they pay the same thing.
*  See us bring a new fucking movie.
*  So it's been incredibly successful, man, like big sold out shows.
*  We've had to like double up on shows.
*  But watching it with the audience is like it's it's it's fantastic.
*  Do you guys do a Q&A or afterwards?
*  And I we share the stage, which is difficult because I tend to, you know, as you see, I
*  like I'm blah, blah, blah.
*  So I've tried to hold back to let him kind of take front and center during the Q&A because
*  he's the star of the movie and he's amazing in the fucking flick.
*  Like I tell people at the beginning of every night.
*  I'm like, I we only get to make this journey and we've been doing it for 25 years since
*  Clark's because like I met a boy who said dirty things to me and I said, come with me.
*  We're going to Hollywood.
*  And like I met a true American original, Jason Muse, who I said, you, I think you're funny.
*  I wonder if people would find you funny outside of New Jersey.
*  And like somebody should put you in a movie one day.
*  And then one day I was that person and he was our passport and has been our passport
*  to the world.
*  The guy least likely, the guy that was never going to get out of Highlands.
*  You know, on his own accord, but like simply by being like, wait, say these things here on camera.
*  Now we've got a movie like he opened up the entire world to us.
*  So it's his finest hour in this movie.
*  Like he's funny as fuck and he cares the whole show.
*  But he also gets to be emotional because it's about him finding out he's got a long lost
*  daughter and shit.
*  So it's father daughter movie.
*  And so there are moments in the movie where people cry and not because like Kevin fucked
*  up another movie.
*  Like they're like, oh my God, like he's he's getting me there.
*  As an actor, it's been like fucking thrilling to watch.
*  So every night, like it was thrown and watched when we made it every night, I get to like
*  sit back and watch the audience take it in.
*  And I'm used to making comedy and you want people laughing.
*  Otherwise, if it's silence, it's death.
*  But there are moments in the movie where like it's quiet and that's a good thing.
*  And like, you know, I still clench my asshole because in any silence, you're always like,
*  you just need one heckler to be like, fuck this blows or whatever.
*  And the audience breaks or whatever.
*  So far, man, it's been like really fucking beautiful.
*  You just put the seed out there though.
*  The fuck this blows.
*  So you know, I know, I know.
*  Fuck, I said fell out of my mouth.
*  I was like, you just damned yourself.
*  We're going to Houston tomorrow night.
*  Like I left the tour because Joe was gracious enough to be like, hey, man, you come in on
*  the 29th and we had a day off and stuff.
*  So I left.
*  I was in Columbus last night.
*  This is a place called Studio 35.
*  They were like, tell Joe Rogan we want him.
*  I was like, to be fair, everybody wants.
*  Do you know Studio 35?
*  Indianola.
*  Fucking on Indianola.
*  Yes.
*  Holy shit, man.
*  Fuck.
*  I was just there.
*  I was there a week ago.
*  What's crazy?
*  You were there a week ago.
*  So you know that theater.
*  It's fantastic fucking theater.
*  I always know Columbus as that theater, as that street.
*  And then we actually went into the city and I was like,
*  they built a whole city around that little corner and shit.
*  They're like, that's been here forever.
*  Did you know, and you must know,
*  Columbus is the swinger capital of the United States of America.
*  What?
*  Columbus says a lot of things.
*  Is that what it says on the license plate?
*  Maybe.
*  Yeah.
*  But Columbus says a lot of things.
*  It probably should.
*  We were staying there.
*  We went to do a show at Studio 35 years ago for the first time.
*  Almost 10 years ago, we've known these cats.
*  Great people.
*  And they put us up in a house.
*  The house was neatly appointed, but nobody lived there.
*  Even as an Airbnb, it was just very clean and shit.
*  And so when we got back to the place, they're like, do you like the house?
*  And we were like, yeah, it's nice, man.
*  It's in the middle of the woods, away from everything,
*  down a beaten path and shit.
*  And we were like, yeah, it's nice.
*  They're like, it's the swinger house.
*  And I'm like, what do you mean?
*  They're like, that's the house where the swingers go to fuck.
*  Should they were like, didn't you notice all the boxes of tissues?
*  And I realized every fucking room had a box of tissues in the corner.
*  So it's the swing.
*  And I was like, why would that happen here in Columbus, Ohio?
*  And they were like, Columbus, Ohio is the swinger capital
*  of the United States of America.
*  You should go back with a black light.
*  And check it all out.
*  Look at this Jackson Pollock motherfucker.
*  Find out what's happening, where the splatters are.
*  I think I remember that night sleeping on my jacket on top of the bed.
*  Because I was like, you know, I got my own come to deal with.
*  Had you ever heard that?
*  Or is that horseshit?
*  That's where Hustler started was in Columbus.
*  Really?
*  Downtown Columbus is where Larry Flint started Hustler.
*  I think we're fucking on to something, man.
*  Columbus is the birth of a lot of fucking places.
*  That's what he said.
*  You open up the door for Jamie.
*  He's got conspiracy theories that go for days.
*  This would change the whole show.
*  So I don't care, man.
*  Columbus is this hidden jewel.
*  It's a great place.
*  It is really, really great place.
*  I love it.
*  But there it's a great fucking theater, man.
*  I've yet to see any proof of swing or activity myself.
*  I recorded my 2009 Comedy Central special at the was a spike TV special at the time
*  at the Southern Theater in Columbus.
*  Yeah.
*  With a good crowd.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  It's great.
*  I love Columbus.
*  I love it.
*  Last time I was there was like what?
*  Year and a half ago?
*  Yeah, September.
*  The Schottenstein.
*  Yeah.
*  About a year.
*  They came out for us last night, man.
*  They sold out two shows for us.
*  Really lovely people.
*  So we go to Houston tomorrow.
*  First show in Houston sold out.
*  I'm there in a couple weeks.
*  Are you?
*  Yeah.
*  Second, sell me a few tickets.
*  We got to sell like 20 tickets in that second Houston show
*  because we've not had a show that isn't sold out.
*  Like we played the Fillmore in Detroit that was sold out.
*  When is it?
*  When is the show?
*  There's one, the one in Houston Spar Night,
*  but then there's like San Diego.
*  There's a, Chattanooga.
*  That's been a difficult one to sell.
*  You ever been to Chattanooga?
*  No, I've never been.
*  We posted a show and it was moving and we were like,
*  all right, we'll add a second show.
*  And then both of the shows kind of stalled a certain place.
*  So Chattanooga, Tennessee.
*  How active are you on social media?
*  Pretty active.
*  Like I post every day on Instagram and every day on Twitter.
*  I kind of keep those active.
*  What's the new one that all the kids do?
*  TikTok.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you do TikTok?
*  Nope.
*  Because we're men.
*  I'm a man.
*  Like we're fucking butch.
*  Just we're old men.
*  We're old.
*  We're old.
*  How old are you?
*  49.
*  52.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  So like not for nothing, but like if that's 52 and this is 49, what were we worried about?
*  We were worried about what 52 was when we were in high school.
*  Which was what?
*  Dead people.
*  People who didn't take vitamins, people who didn't exercise regularly, people weren't on top of it.
*  Maybe I'm just biased because the older I get, I want to believe this, but like
*  didn't 50 look older when you were a kid?
*  Oh, 100% did.
*  Like when my dad was 50, I was like, oh fuck, all right, there's 50.
*  Dudes look different now.
*  It's health.
*  Diet's a big factor.
*  Getting enough nutrients, not smoking cigarettes, that's a huge factor.
*  Smoking weed and stuff.
*  That's true.
*  I put cigarettes down.
*  Weed probably does a lot for you.
*  It relaxes you for sure.
*  We'd save my life.
*  It for sure reduces inflammation.
*  CBD, I am a giant proponent of CBD.
*  I take CBD every day.
*  I don't want this to sound like a commercial, but that's Sativa is pumped up with 30% CBD.
*  He jacks up the CBD.
*  So when you smoke it, you're not only healing something as you smoke it,
*  but it's a nice crisp pie.
*  That sounds like a commercial, but it's good.
*  Yeah.
*  I take it in drop form.
*  I drink this stuff, Kill Cliff, which is a drink that has CBD in it.
*  I just think it's a miracle anti-inflammatory elixir from nature.
*  I'm a huge believer in it.
*  It alleviates anxiety.
*  It's good for so many people with arthritis and so many issues.
*  My friend Dave Foley, his hands were all fucked up, man.
*  He had real bad arthritis, and now they move freely and easily.
*  News Radio Dave Foley.
*  Yeah, News Radio Dave Foley has full use of his hands because of CBD.
*  Because of the CBDs.
*  Yeah.
*  He deserves full use of his hands.
*  That dude's a genius.
*  He does.
*  He is.
*  You saw him work.
*  Yes.
*  I have to tell you.
*  I got something I usually say to people like,
*  Dave Foley's a genius and you got to back it up,
*  but I could just say it to you and you're like, bro, I told you.
*  He was the guy.
*  Are you seriously opening a fucking beer with a knife?
*  Look how butch you are.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's so Rambo, bro.
*  It's for people to think I'm cheating.
*  It's Heineken Zero alcohol.
*  And is that so?
*  Sober October includes, I guess it includes.
*  It's not just weed sober.
*  Everything.
*  It's not sex sober, is it?
*  Oh no.
*  That's not sobriety.
*  I thought you were going straight at yourself.
*  That's gross.
*  Wow.
*  And not for charity, not for king or country, just for fucking.
*  Well, we started it off, what happened was it started off four years ago with a weight
*  loss challenge.
*  I'm cheating my friend Tom Segura and my friend Bert Kreischer.
*  And I kind of hosted the weight loss challenge.
*  They had to see who could lose the most.
*  That's Bert.
*  Who could lose the most over the course of a month and the winner, I sent them to a
*  basketball game and Ari sent them to, what did Ari send them to?
*  Some other.
*  They went to the national championship.
*  Yeah.
*  They went to some, you know, they had a good time, right?
*  So that was one year.
*  Then the next year we all decided to join in.
*  During the whole weight loss challenge, Bert kept drinking.
*  We're very concerned about Bert's health.
*  And so we're like, man, Bert's going to fucking die if we don't get this motherfucker to
*  stop drinking.
*  Do you think he could stop drinking?
*  And I said, all right, how about we all do it?
*  We'll all go sober for the whole, well, I didn't even know that sober October is like
*  a thing.
*  People have been doing it for years long before us.
*  We just invented a rhyme and they're like, no, it was just pure coincidence that we
*  started with the first weight loss thing was October as well, right?
*  Was it?
*  I think it started close to the end of the Thanksgiving time period or something like
*  that.
*  What?
*  Because the weigh-in was in like January, I believe.
*  Was it?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Well, for whatever reason, we decided to do it during October.
*  By dumb luck, there was a thing already called sober October.
*  We literally didn't even know when we started doing it.
*  So we did it and we incorporated a challenge.
*  We had to do 15 hot yoga classes and everybody didn't believe that everyone was sober.
*  Ari said he was going to drug test me.
*  Jared Sussman
*  I think it happened too because Ari was gone and we had to do that like another podcast,
*  talk about the Welch of the Bet and that was probably like in September and then it was like,
*  oh, well October is next month, sober October and then I was like, that makes sense.
*  Yeah, because Ari was gone for like four months in Asia.
*  So we had sobriety for a month plus 15 90-minute hot yoga classes over the month.
*  So you had to do basically a yoga class every other day, which was great.
*  So we did that and then last year we said, okay, we'll do it again,
*  but this year we're going to do a fitness challenge.
*  That got really crazy.
*  So that year it was a competition and that year we were working out five,
*  six, seven hours a day.
*  I set off the fire alarm in my gym for my sweat, literally from steam coming off my body,
*  set off the fire alarm.
*  Is that possible?
*  It's possible.
*  I have a video.
*  Pete Slauson
*  Is this serious?
*  Jared Sussman
*  Yes.
*  Pete Slauson
*  Yes.
*  Pete Slauson
*  So you got your body heated up so much to the fire alarm.
*  Jared Slauson
*  My home gym is essentially a little smaller than this room
*  and it has, you know, elliptical machine in the cage and squat rack and all that jazz.
*  And I set off the fucking fire alarm from steam because I did five,
*  six hours on the elliptical machine.
*  Pete Slauson
*  I watched this.
*  Pete Slauson
*  There was a –
*  Jared Slauson
*  Look at that.
*  Like you can –
*  Pete Slauson
*  Steam in this room.
*  Pete Slauson
*  That's it.
*  Jared Slauson
*  You can hear it if you listen to your –
*  Pete Slauson
*  Oh my God. Look at the fog.
*  Jared Slauson
*  Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson
*  Oh, there's the alarm.
*  Jared Slauson
*  That puddle on the ground, that's all my sweat.
*  Pete Slauson
*  Are you kidding?
*  Jared Slauson
*  Nope.
*  Pete Slauson
*  I decided not – all that.
*  Jared Slauson
*  Why do this?
*  Pete Slauson
*  Well, because I'm going to win.
*  Jared Slauson
*  And did you?
*  Pete Slauson
*  I'm not going to lose. Of course I won. I'm not going to lose.
*  Jared Slauson
*  Going crazy.
*  Pete Slauson
*  We were going crazy and then we all had to sit down this year and say,
*  we can't do this again. Because this year, we only had to do ten classes. So,
*  whether it's yoga or Tom's doing boxing and it took some – we took some tactical gun courses and
*  Tom's also done some weightlifting. Ari's done some meditation classes. It's all just bettering
*  yourself and you have to read 500 pages of books, whatever book, 500 pages. So, that's the challenge
*  this month. Easier.
*  Pete Slauson
*  All of that is – it's just not on my menu.
*  Jared Slauson
*  Exhausting.
*  Pete Slauson
*  Yeah, my God. It's just – like October should be a fun month. We're heading into Halloween and
*  stuff like that.
*  Jared Slauson
*  Right.
*  Pete Slauson
*  Fall, Sam Hain, shit like that. And it just seems like a lot of –
*  Jared Slauson
*  What is this? What'd you say?
*  Pete Slauson
*  Sam Hain.
*  Jared Slauson
*  Sam Hain?
*  Pete Slauson
*  A little bit of metal.
*  Jared Slauson
*  Man, a minute, a minute, a minute.
*  Jared Slauson
*  What's Sam Hain?
*  Pete Slauson
*  Sam Hain, remember? Like, Sam Hain is the – it's the end of summer,
*  the festival of Sam Hain's.
*  Jared Slauson
*  I have no idea what that is. I've never heard that before.
*  Pete Slauson
*  They talk about it on Halloween. Pull up the clip.
*  Jared Slauson
*  The movie?
*  Pete Slauson
*  Halloween?
*  Jared Slauson
*  I was shooting the Showtime special between shows. I had the heart attack.
*  So then I started losing weight. First I went on Penn Jillette's suggested diet with Ray Cronies,
*  Just Sides, and it was like all potatoes, just eat potatoes for like two weeks.
*  And I was like, this will be easy. I love potatoes. And after two fucking days, you learn you ate
*  potatoes. Like you love milk and salt and butter and shit that goes in the mashed potatoes, but
*  just eating the baked potato like – and you can have as many as you want. They're like, oh my god,
*  eat as many as you fucking want. And like, that's where I learned fasting. Because when your choice
*  is like a fucking potato or nothing, you're like, you know what, I'd rather eat fucking air than eat
*  a potato and stuff. And then you realize, oh, I'm okay. Like, I didn't die. And my body will start
*  feeding off some stored fat. So at that point when I had the heart attack, my kid was like,
*  please go vegan. Because there was a nutritionist was in the room the morning after I had the heart
*  attacks. Kid slept there all night just staring at me to make sure I didn't like fucking have a
*  second heart attack. And really that wasn't the big danger. The big danger apparently was in order
*  to get to my heart, they punctured my groin. That's how they get to your heart. That's the easiest,
*  fastest route and stuff. And so the whole night, they're like, yeah, yeah. Well, I mean,
*  they could either crack your chest, but they don't like to do that anymore, right? So it's not as
*  invasive to go through your femoral. And so you go through the groin. Some people go through the
*  wrist as well. I met a cat who was like, they went through my wrist. I was like, why did they go
*  through my groin? He's like, probably wanted to see your dick. So I sat there. I've – after
*  the morning after the kid was there and the nutritionist was like, you should, you know,
*  if you thought about plant-based, that'll cut your cholesterol down or at least losing some meat.
*  And the kid was like, yeah, go vegan, one of us. And, you know, she was definitely looking out
*  for me. But at the same time, she knew that like I'd be a big get for the vegan community. Like,
*  oh, I flip this fucking motherfucker. This one eat meat eating. I used to drink two gallons of
*  milk a day. If I could flip him, that's a good get. So I tried it and I was like, oh, I'll give
*  it a shot. I lived the way I wanted to for many, many years. And obviously that led me to almost
*  dying. So how about I try what you're talking about, you know, for a few months, six months.
*  And that was a year and a half over a year and a half ago. So being vegan and also intermittent
*  fasting, meaning essentially I don't do breakfast like yourself, has dropped me down another 70. So
*  I'm one 98 right now, which is like my high school weight. Wow. Yeah, that's kind of nuts.
*  More than a hundred. Over the entire time that we've known each other. Yeah. I've lost a human
*  being. I've delivered a child and it went somewhere. It's down. I used to carry it like an embedded twin
*  and shit. Yeah. A lean woman. Or a young, you know, or a lean man. I mean, how much you weigh?
*  All right. Well, half of you. That's a, that's an awesome accomplishment, man. It was, it wasn't,
*  I didn't try like, you know, again, weight watchers are now they're called WW. They were absolutely
*  helpful, but it was never about like, I want to look better. It was just, you know, my options were
*  get healthier fucking guy. My old man had two heart attacks. First one was a warning. Second
*  one took them out. And you know, as much as I could change my lifestyle and I did like,
*  I still got my mom and my dad's like hearts and are you big, the defective. Yeah. I hike every day
*  up running except since we've been on the tour, that's been a little more only hike difficult.
*  Yeah. All the way up and stuff. I haven't gotten into weights or anything. The good thing about
*  strength training is strength training is, uh, is particularly important as you get older.
*  It maintains bone density, maintains your muscle mass. And, uh, there's a lot of correlations
*  between people who exercise and maintain muscle and heart health and, uh, just, just overall
*  vitality of your body, a stronger body is more durable, you know, and, you know, it's not hard
*  for you to hire somebody, just hire a trainer. That's true. I think when I'm done with the tour,
*  like we're done in February. Yeah. Just hire somebody. It's time. And you know, you can hire
*  somebody. The way it has been like that, I never imagined I'd ever do. So I never imagined
*  I'd have muscles. Like I never done a pull up my entire fucking life. I remember in high school,
*  hanging on the bar and they're like, move on Smitty. Cause like, I couldn't fucking get there.
*  Be nice to do a pull up for this world, especially like what if I'm hanging off a cliff and I'm in
*  danger. It's a hundred percent possible for you to do a pull up in this life. Not, not today,
*  but no, but in this life. Yeah. And you're right. It's like slow build. And I've also got like
*  access to like, Hey, I'll hire you. Yes. It's not even like, I gotta get my shit together and do it.
*  Exactly. It's good to go somewhere. It's good to go somewhere instead of having someone come to you.
*  It's, it's like a change of environment. Sort of, it puts you in the mode, like, okay, we're here
*  to work. But I recommend that to anyone who's getting, well, I just, anyone period. I think
*  strength training is very, very important. You've actually sold me. It don't take much. I'm pretty
*  gullible, but you've actually sold me in as much as like, I trust you. You're smart. And what you
*  said about bones, that's, and he makes a lot of sense and I'm only getting older and that shit's
*  only getting more Halloween. Yeah. Weight bearing exercises, carrying weight. And you know, it
*  doesn't have to kill you. It doesn't have to be something that's brutal and it breaks you down.
*  So you're exhausted the next day. You really want like a light workout. You really want a slow build,
*  find someone who understands the state of fitness that you're at right now and gives you a nice,
*  slow build, just like squats with very little weight, a few deadlifts with very little weight,
*  just a little bit of this and a little bit of that, a little bit of pushups, a little bit of
*  setups. That's it. You don't need to work out that long. You can work out a half an hour,
*  you know, three days a week and you're golden. What makes a giant change in your life? Sure.
*  Those are, I like them odds three days a week. Oh yeah. So you don't even have to do it every day.
*  No, you don't want to do it every day. But that 30 minutes, is it like a fucking not fighting 30
*  minutes? No, build your body up to that. You got to realize you are a guy who's never really
*  gotten after it your whole life. So if you just shock your body into getting after it now,
*  it's probably going to revolt. You don't want that. They already tried that. Yeah. You want
*  it was like, fuck you. You want just some light weight bearing exercise, you know, and build up
*  over a few months, man. There's no rush. You know, you're just trying to be healthy, right?
*  You're not trying to fucking win Mr. Olympia. Just start slow. Do like weights with a squat
*  rack and like fucking 25 pounds on each side, just three or four, just three or four, put it down.
*  You know, what really irritates me about this is like, as you imitated a guy doing squats,
*  you closed your eyes, you went to a place, you literally played a character, you acted in front
*  of me. Well, it's just, I'm thinking about just doing it. I could do it. If I'd shot your thing
*  here, it might've, it might've made more sense. Make it so easy. Do it all the time. So it's me.
*  It's like, I understand that. So it was adorable though, as you closed your eye.
*  Well, I'm picturing you doing it. My eyes would be popping out of my head.
*  Nah, you'd be fine. Cause I don't want you to do anything that makes your eyes pop out of your
*  head. But how do I get muscly then? It takes time, man. Time is an investment. I don't know
*  if I have that. It's a slow changing, like water hitting rocks, right? When you see like water
*  carving a pathway through rocks, that shit takes forever. It takes forever. And that's the same
*  thing with fitness. You're not going to get giant muscles quick. I mean, you could be one of those
*  fucking psychopaths that decide to completely change their life and completely dedicate themselves
*  to fitness. And all of a sudden you get jacked and you have all these muscles, but that is going to
*  have to be a massive commitment and a life-changing thing. And for a guy who's had a heart attack,
*  I don't recommend that at all. I recommend you just slowly start working out with weights,
*  nothing even brutal. You know what a Turkish getup is? No, it's a great exercise. That's
*  different. Full body exercise. You have a kettlebell in your hand. You lie down on your back on the
*  ground. You lift your arm up, you slowly get up to your feet where you're standing up with proper
*  technique. And then you let it down and then you sit down again and you lie back down on your back
*  again. It's a full body workout and it's not, you know, it's nothing that's going to kill you.
*  It's something that's just going to give you a little bit of strain,
*  the strength in your connective tissues. You don't have to do that many, four or five.
*  Like that's what I would say. And that's done for the day?
*  No, you do a couple other things, do a couple other things, but I'm not talking about you
*  breaking your body down for at all. I'm talking about you slowly adding resistance training.
*  This meathead mentality that you got to go out and break your body down. I think that's
*  a terrible thing to do to someone who doesn't exercise because they're going to be in fucking
*  severe pain. And it's also, I don't think it's productive. I don't think it's necessary.
*  I think the way to do it is to lightly get into it. Then once you start feeling it,
*  I feel a little bit better. It's easier to open up a jar of pickles. Everything's moving better,
*  you know, and then you ramp it up a little bit.
*  Hold on. You fucking sold me on the pickle opener.
*  Pickles are hard, man, to this day.
*  I never, I hate pickles, but you know, it's tough to open up as like a jar of tomato sauce.
*  Yes, it's hard, man.
*  Many times I've turned to my wife and be like, is it just me? Can you try this?
*  There's gotta be fitness in my fucking jeans somewhere, man, because my mom's dad was a boxer.
*  Like growing up, like a guy, and he had a record. He was Kid Dixie Schultz. Growing up,
*  like in my grandmother's house, there was a picture of a guy like in that position with
*  trunks, but old timey like, and I was like, who's that? And she's like, that's grandpa.
*  And he didn't look like grandpa, so I never associated it. But apparently he was a boxer.
*  Well, that would be a fun thing for you to do too. Not even box somebody, but have someone
*  hit, hold pads for you and you'll learn how to punch and hit pads. Cause it's exciting. It's
*  fun to do. It's like an interesting thing to do. You hit things like Batman. That's how you sell it.
*  Does Batman hit pads?
*  He hits fucking, you know, injustice.
*  Oh, right, right.
*  My boxer grandfather. I want to see if you agree with this.
*  Okay.
*  So you've been the man in the ring, so to speak. You've been at the epicenter of attention of the
*  thousand, five thousand bunch of people as a man on stage. Even the man in the ring, sometimes when
*  you're doing a UFC event and stuff like that, you know what it's like the surge, the energy
*  that comes from like, I'm here and everybody's got, I got their attention and I command the
*  fucking room. It's part of why we do what we do. My grandfather, having been a boxer, must've felt
*  that right? Like fucking probably way more than I feel when I walk up on stage or, or on the reboot
*  road show tour. I'm like, Oh, I feel clever sitting in the back watching the movie with the audience
*  and hear them laugh. This is a guy who is like, I'm the man in the ring and like, it's all up to me
*  and my fists and I could be a God or a goat tonight. And like, and then it becomes primal
*  and there's pounding and shit like that. You would imagine there's a, if you got in the ring
*  and he pursued it enough to have a record, there must've been some sort of call, some sort of
*  satisfaction to it all. Maybe it, sometimes people do it for money, right? Maybe this guy, no,
*  been a way to make a living. No, this guy, I don't know. He, I mean,
*  you don't think he did it. I think he was hoping for purses, but I don't think it was just like
*  this or mailman, although that's where the story's kind of gone, not mailman, but
*  this was a guy who boxed professionally. And the story was that my grandmother,
*  like when they had their first kid, my half Virginia, my grandmother was like, you can't
*  be a boxer anymore. And so he was like, all right. And then he stopped being a boxer.
*  And then my grandfather became a custodian in the Newark courthouse. And every day he would like,
*  get dressed up in a suit and take the bus to the Newark courthouse. They lived in a different
*  section of Newark. And then he'd put on his custodian outfit and like clean the toilets,
*  sweep the floors and stuff like that. Noble salt of the earth. So my whole life, I never
*  questioned this. You know, your wife says you quit and you quit and stuff like that until I became
*  older and I became something of the man in the ring myself. I know what it's like to stand,
*  you know, at attention for everybody, where everybody, you are the focus of thousands,
*  where you get a level of affection from a, from a, of one vociferous mass that you is unparalleled
*  from any amount of affection you give many other single human being in this world. It is,
*  I've never done heroin, but I imagine it's better than heroin. It's one of the greatest drugs. It
*  fuels us. And you know, we obviously like it. We keep fucking doing it. We make money off it. Yes,
*  but there's many ways to make money and we like it and we do it because there's power to it. And
*  it feels fantastic. And you feel like, man, they like me. They really like me.
*  And then I started thinking, why would he have put that all to the side? Like, how do you step
*  outside all that just because your wife is like, I don't want you to do that anymore.
*  And then it made me re consider my grandparents and I figured out and I want to see if you back me on
*  this play. You don't know these cats. So you've got no skin in the game. So you can't offend
*  anybody. Doesn't that sound like she did dirty shit that nobody else did in the bed? You mean,
*  yes, son, where else but the bed? I didn't have that thought at all. No, my thought is that he
*  recognized that it's very dangerous and he probably knew people who died and he probably wanted to
*  find a way out of it anyway, which most fighters do. Most fighters at some point in time, they
*  realize I'm going to have to jump off this ride one day. I can't stay on this ride until I'm a
*  dead man, tell him 90 years old or a hundred years old. It's not feasible. It doesn't exist.
*  There's no 98 year old boxers out there. You think he faced his own mortality? Every boxer does.
*  Every fighter does. You hit someone and you see them get hurt. Well, then he's probably been hurt.
*  You see people get hurt. You see people get pummeled. You see people get knocked out. Maybe
*  you've been knocked out yourself and you realize that this is something that is unsustainable.
*  If he's not making any money at it, it's extremely dangerous. You start thinking,
*  what could happen to you? What can happen to you? It happens to people. You see it happen. If it
*  hasn't happened to you, you watch it happen to other people. If you're around combat sports enough,
*  you're going to see people get fucked up. When you see people get fucked up, you realize,
*  hey, this is voluntary. There's other ways to make a living. I don't have to do this anymore.
*  I can get off this ride. Or you're the type of person that doesn't give a fuck and you want to
*  be a champion. Your thought is you are here for glory. You are here for a legacy. You're here to
*  leave your mark. You want to go down in history as a great. If you don't feel that way, I tell
*  people to get out. I think fighting is one of the most singular pursuits a person can get into.
*  Yeah. It's like you're not only giving like the, I'm dedicating myself to something. You're
*  giving your body something that you've taught your entire life, protect this.
*  The consequences are so grave. The consequence, zigging and zagging, you go the wrong way. You
*  run into a knee, wrong way. You run into a head kick, wrong way. You run into a punch. You duck
*  into an uppercut. Your fucking lights go out. You're laying on your back. They're going to
*  flashlight your face and ice on the back of your neck. You don't even know what day it is. You
*  don't know what. Then that, you never get back. You can only get so many of those in your life.
*  It depends on the person, but you get knocked out three, four, five times, whatever the number is.
*  There's a certain number that your life is going to be fucking different now because now your brain
*  doesn't work good anymore. That's a fact. Maybe it'll get a little bit better over time. Maybe
*  you can go through some cognitive therapy. There's some different things they're doing with
*  magnets and different things they're doing with stem cells where they're shooting them
*  straight into your cerebral spinal fluid. They think that that might have some sort of a positive
*  impact on CTE, but man, the reality is combat sports are a fucking brutal, brutal business.
*  Do you think it's possible he just got to a place where he was like-
*  Yeah, he's probably smart.
*  This is my perfect excuse to not fucking do it.
*  Yeah, because he wasn't making any money doing it either, it sounds like.
*  I got to tell you, he gave me, he gave him his dignity back. I honestly was like,
*  he gave it all up because she gave up the ass. She was like a dirty German girl who was just like,
*  I will let you do the anvil, you've got to get out of the ring. And he was like, she was like,
*  I'll give you one ring for the other. And he was like, fuck, god damn it, Gussie. He called her
*  Gussie. Did you imagine fucking calling somebody Gussie?
*  It was more likely love and family.
*  No. I knew these motherfuckers love.
*  Kids. He's got a kid, right?
*  They had a few.
*  Well, when he has a kid, man, everybody loves their kids and you want to be around to see those
*  kids grow up and you don't want to be brain dead. And everybody, look, I personally know a lot of
*  people that have combat sports induced brain damage. There's no doubt about it. No if, ands or buts.
*  Yeah. This is why when I see anybody who's like half in, half out, I go fucking hard in the paint.
*  I tell them, you got to get the fuck out of this now. You got to trust me. And I've done it to the
*  point where people think I'm mean. And I'm like, look, I'm not mean about very many things in this
*  life. But when it comes to people who are delusional about their abilities in combat sports or their
*  future in combat sports, I get fucking mean because I think you got to know, you got to know with no
*  uncertain terms. I can't be protective of your feelings. I have to go in hard because no one
*  else is going to. People don't. They bullshit you. Coaches bullshit you. Trainers bullshit you. They
*  tell you you got a chance. Promoters are willing to put you on fights when you really should retire.
*  It is a dirty aspect of the business and I don't play that shit. If I think that someone should get
*  out, I go hard and I tell them. And I've done it to friends. I've done it to guys that I've done
*  commentary for. They've asked me and they pulled me aside and I said, you got to get out, man. You
*  got to get out because you could talk right now. You're okay right now. But how many more shots can
*  you take? How many more times can you get knocked out? One KO can change your whole fucking life.
*  Meljerk Taylor got knocked out by Julio Cesar Chavez and Meljerk Taylor was an Olympic gold
*  medalist, a fantastic boxer, was fast as fuck, lightning fast combinations, beautiful skill.
*  But Julio Cesar Chavez just kept wearing on him and wearing on him and boom, he dropped him in
*  the final round. And they stopped the fight with like seconds to go in the fight. Richard Steele
*  stopped the fight. It was a big controversy. Like, oh my God, how could he stop the fight?
*  Meljerk was ahead in the scorecards and there was only a couple seconds to go and Meljerk would have
*  won a decision. It was the right call because he was done after that fight, man. After that fight,
*  he was never the same. You hear him talk today, it's the saddest shit in the world. He can barely
*  put together a sentence. And he had a few fights after that against Terry Norris, who was a brutal
*  knockout puncher and a couple other guys. He just was never the same again. It was that one fight,
*  one fight, one beating too much. And it just, it all fell apart on him. And that can happen.
*  That can happen to any fighter. And when you're done, you're done. And you, you, you,
*  the only way you should ever compete as a fighter is if it is, this is your fucking calling. This
*  is the thing that you're obsessed with. It is your 100% focus. And as soon as it's not, as soon as
*  you have doubts, get out because there's a bunch of people out there that don't have doubts. And
*  I always try to tell people, like, think about Mike Tyson before he won the title. Think about
*  the Mike Tyson that destroyed Marvis Frazier. Think about that motherfucker. That guy's all in.
*  You don't ever want to face a guy who's all in when you're half ass in it. And a lot of people
*  are half ass in it and they don't even realize they're half ass in it. They just have this thing
*  in their head. Well, I'm training pretty hard. I'm doing good. I got good skills. I could beat this
*  guy, but when someone's in there in and it's combat sports are uniquely dangerous in terms of the
*  consequences of you not being committed. So you got to know when to get out and no one does.
*  Very few people. There's like a few guys. Andre Ward, retired, undefeated, Olympic gold medalist,
*  two division world champion. He's the rarest of the rare. Most guys, they keep going until they get
*  fucked up. They keep going until they get knocked out. They get brutalized and then you meet them
*  afterwards and they could barely talk, man. They could barely talk. I've seen so many guys, they
*  barely string words together. Everything's a mumble. All the words are slur into the next word. It's
*  horrible, man. And I saw it in the gym. I saw it in the gym with guys who never made it. They still
*  got brain damage. The fucking, the gods of combat sports, they don't give a fuck if you win a title.
*  If you're eating shots, you take punches to the head, kicks to the head, you're getting
*  fucked up, man, no matter what. It seems like, why, how come they didn't talk about that for years
*  and years? They didn't know. They did know that people get punched drunk, but they didn't know
*  what was causing it. It's not even knockouts. It's subconcussive trauma that does the vast majority.
*  They have a lot in the world of hockey as well. Yes. Subconcussive trauma is terrible, but
*  knockouts are also horrific. And then for me, my discussions with guys like Dr. Mark Gordon,
*  who's an expert in traumatic brain injuries and he works with a lot of soldiers and he runs his TBI
*  foundation to deal with injuries that soldiers and football players and fighters face and his
*  descriptions of it will scare the fucking shit out of you. I mean, he's like, he's like, people
*  can get brain damage from fucking jet skiing. Just blam, blam, blam. All that bouncing up and down.
*  So not even getting a jet ski accident, just like. Just jet skiing. And if you jet ski accidents,
*  exacerbate it. But he's talking about like people, some people get in accidents, some sort of a,
*  something happens to you, we get knocked out and they are never the same again. This is a real thing.
*  You can get a shot to the head, a golf ball, somebody misses, they crack you in the head
*  with a golf ball, right? You get hit with a line drive. That kind of shit changes people forever,
*  forever. So your grandfather probably wanted out. First, all right, some thoughts. Number one,
*  uh, sober October gives you a different Joe Rogan. Yeah. Oh my God, you're so dialed in.
*  It's beautiful. Um, I could, you're the Ken Burns of, of, uh, combat sports. I can listen to you,
*  spin yarns, tell tales. Um, you know what? That's unfair. The Ken Burns, I call you the Gene
*  Shepherd of, I don't know who that is, but I hope he's awesome. You love Gene Shepard. Remember
*  Christmas story? Yeah. He's the guy that narrates Christmas story. He wrote the books, the essays
*  that it's all based on. Um, my other thoughts, um, that is far more dignity than I ever afforded
*  my grandfather. I appreciate it. My mom is going to appreciate that. Um, and then fourth, fuck,
*  I lost my point. I thought I hit enough of them. It's to me, uh, it hits home because I,
*  I needed to know when I needed to retire too. When I stopped fighting, I knew it was like,
*  I am not doing this the way I used to do this. You know, I used to be completely obsessed,
*  but I saw a bunch of people get knocked out. Um, I knocked a bunch of people out. I knew that,
*  that easily could have been me. What does it feel like to knock somebody out?
*  It's weird. It's a bittersweet feeling. Like you don't feel good. You know, it feels-
*  If you were in a true combat position, it would feel good.
*  Well, fighting for your life, you mean? Yeah. In competition, I mean, it was all
*  people my age, you know, like I was 19, 20 years old and I'm, I'm standing over this
*  unconscious version of me, you know, that I just kicked in the head. And that's how the person,
*  yeah. The amount of force you can generate with a kick is just so terrifying. It's so terrifying,
*  you know, the thing that that's going to bounce off your head and the lights go out and then
*  you could incur legitimate permanent brain damage from something like that.
*  Is it in the initial kick or in the hit, the drops to the canvas?
*  Both. This is the kick. Somebody kicks you in the head. Somebody really knows how to kick. They
*  bounce a fucking shin off your temple. You might not ever be the same again. That's real.
*  And you've been knocked out? I've never been knocked out. I've been
*  stopped, which means, uh, I got TKO'd, I got dropped with a punch and then the guy followed
*  up with a bunch of punches and the referee stopped the fight. That was the last fight I ever had.
*  But, uh, I was never unconscious. Hold on. There's a lot of details. Slow it down.
*  Yeah, I got, I was in a kickboxing fight. Actually it was three fights in a day. Um,
*  I won the first two, uh, won the first one by knockout. I beat the fuck out of the second guy
*  and I was pretty sick actually going into the fight, going into the, uh, the tournament. I
*  would get sick sometimes cause I'd be nervous and shit. I wasn't, my nutrition was terrible.
*  And then the third fight I got hit with a left hook and I got, I won the first round
*  and then the second round I got hit with a left hook and my legs just went boink. They just stopped
*  working. I remember going, what the fuck? Shit. I can never been dropped like that before where
*  my legs just, he was a perfect left hook. He just caught me right on the chin. So what,
*  if he catches you on the chin, what is the, what's happening that it's, it hit, it's like,
*  it connects brain, twists your brain, right? And your brain, like it, it also does something
*  that's like nerves behind your jaw. And when you get hit hard and it just, it's like an electrical
*  charge goes into your body and everything just shuts off. It's weird. Like I was totally
*  conscious, but my legs just stopped working and then while that happening, while that's happening,
*  more punches are coming. No, because it was kickboxing was an MMA and MMA, the guy would
*  jump on you and they'd stop it right there. Or you would maybe grab ahold of them and maybe you
*  would survive. Maybe you wouldn't, you know, there's arguments that it's safer in MMA because they
*  stop it quicker. There's also arguments that when it goes to the ground, you could actually survive
*  better and you could hold on. And maybe that would allow you to take more damage and maybe
*  that's not as safe. I'm in the former camp. I think it's safer because I think when fights
*  get stopped quicker, it's safer. But, so when you got jolted and electricity went there,
*  did you go down? Yeah, I went down. My legs, my, my, my legs just stopped working like this. Like
*  I'm standing up. He hit me and it might've just go plank. Yeah. So you went down under your ass.
*  Yeah, I went down and I got up before the count of 10 referee dust your gloves off and the kid
*  swarmed at me again and hit me with a bunch more punches. And I covered up and the referee stopped
*  the fight. So that was a TKO, which is tactical knockout, but I had already known that I was kind
*  of, I was already doing standup comedy at that time as well. And I had known that I was half in,
*  half out. And then I had to wait, when is this 1989? So this is even before this is before news
*  radio. Oh yeah, way before. Yeah. This was, I was just starting to do standup. So was it for you,
*  you were either going to fight or be funny? No. Well, I knew, I knew somewhere around the time I
*  was 19 that this was not, there was no future in this. And I was trying to make the Olympic team,
*  which was the Nationals were in Miami in 1988. And- Wait, where are you from? Boston. That's where
*  I was out of. So I was a Massachusetts state champion. And then I would go to these national
*  tournaments and compete against like the Illinois champion or the New Hampshire champion.
*  I got to ask a question on behalf of somebody else. Hold on. You got a question stored?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Cause I was talking to, you know, not a humburs. Okay. Your grandmother?
*  Yes. Name Josie.
*  Yes. Gerard way.
*  Yes. Lead singer of my chemical romance. Yes. Yeah. We're related.
*  That's what he said. I was like, I'm going to do Joe Rogan. He goes, I don't have a hundred percent
*  confirmation on this, but I'm pretty sure Joe Rogan is my cousin. I think my aunt Josie was
*  his grandma. Yeah. I don't know him, but we're cousins. How crazy that two people in the same
*  family became super fucking famous and don't even- Yeah. We don't know each other.
*  That's not, you gotta have money. He's fascinating. He's a good, great guest. Yeah.
*  And plus like, you're related. Yeah, we're related. Anyway, back to the story.
*  So, you know, I just, I didn't know what I was going to do for a living. And then there's a
*  few things happened. You know, a few, watching a friend of mine get knocked out really bad. There
*  was a guy named Jersey Long, who was this bad ass Canadian guy who knocked my friend Larry out. He
*  hit him in the head with an ax kick and just changed. Larry was never the same again. He was
*  always like real tentative and nervous, destroyed his confidence. And, you know, we also, we weren't
*  making any money. So these are all amateur fights. Right. So there was this thing like,
*  what am I doing? Like, why am I, why is this my whole life? Why were you doing it? Well,
*  it changed who I was, you know, from the time I was 15 to the time I was 21, almost 22. When I
*  started fighting, when I started doing competitions, it gave me a focus and it gave me something where
*  I didn't feel like I was a loser. Like for the first time in my life, it was something that I
*  didn't, I realized that if I focused on this thing and I dedicated myself to this thing,
*  I could be successful. And that changed how I view-
*  And literally be the opposite of a loser being a winner in most cases.
*  Where I wasn't before that. I was a loser. I just didn't, it didn't have anything going.
*  So it was like- I wasn't good at school.
*  It was your football. Like for some people in high school, it's like, I found football.
*  I found something.
*  Or it was your Jesus. Some people like, I found Jesus.
*  Yes. Yes. Yes. I think that's what people
*  need now. They need a something, whether it's chess or Jesus or filmmaking, whatever the
*  fuck it is. You find a thing and you focus it and you see some success and you're like,
*  oh my God, I can do something. I can do something. I could be somebody. I can do something that's
*  fulfilling and rewarding and I know that I'm not a loser. Because a lot of it is like confidence,
*  right? A lot of it is if you look at your life and you look at things that other people are doing,
*  you go, God, I can't do that. He's doing that. These people can do that. They're different than
*  me. I don't have confidence. It takes doing something and having some success at it that
*  gives you confidence to do other things. And martial arts were so terrifying to me. I was
*  so scared of it that it became by overcoming that and becoming successful at it. It gave me
*  this understanding that you can do, you can basically do, you know, within reason, whatever
*  you want, if you just focus on it and you're not going to do it, it's not going to be immediate.
*  You're not going to be successful immediately and you're going to fail. But through those failures,
*  you learn and you go back and you get some experience and you do it better next time.
*  And that is everything.
*  Failure is just success training.
*  Yeah. And it's like this fucking tattoo, this is Miyamoto Musashi from the book of five rings.
*  And in that book, he said something, I read it when I was like 17 years old. Once you understand
*  the way broadly, you will see it in everything. And that is, if anything, that is one of the main
*  focuses of my life that I think that-
*  One more time, say it.
*  Once you understand the way broadly, you can see it in everything.
*  That describes you. You're a seeker. My favorite proverb is, may you realize
*  your own divinity in this lifetime. I saw it on a yoga wall hanging that my wife put on the
*  house once. And it wasn't really the message she intended. She just liked, I think, the image of
*  Buddha. And one day I was letting the dogs out and I was waiting by the door. So you had time to
*  really stare at it. And I was probably just stoned enough and then completely understood it where I
*  was like, Oh, it is a blessing. May you realize your divinity in this life, your own divinity,
*  meaning don't wait until you drop dead to find out you were God all along,
*  handing it off to somebody else and some higher power, higher powers than you.
*  Motherfucker became a fighter, made him feel worth something. Motherfucker became a filmmaker,
*  made him feel worth something, manifested. He's absolutely right. You can kind of do anything.
*  You can kind of do anything.
*  Within reason. You can't fly without a jet pack.
*  Right. You can't beat LeBron James one-on-one.
*  Yes. And Mike Tyson back when he was-
*  Yeah. There's things you can't do physically.
*  Committed, as you said.
*  But there's a lot of things you can do, a lot of things you can get better at,
*  and especially artistic pursuits. Because the thing about artistic pursuits is you kind of,
*  everybody finds their own way. And so the shift to me from doing something that was competition,
*  especially competition with grave physical consequences-
*  Yeah, really, really. Like, ow!
*  Yeah. To go from that to doing standup. When I first started doing standup, I realized about,
*  okay, this could be it. Like the fucking fighting thing, it's like, it's a dead end.
*  There's no money. This is before the UFC. There was no money in kickboxing. I remember I'd gotten
*  offered a kickboxing fight, a professional fight for 500 bucks. And I was like, what is that?
*  $500? That means I have to train for six weeks? No alcohol, eat good, run, do all these different
*  things, train, spar. And then 500 bucks at the end of it. And then maybe brain damage.
*  It's like when you see what porn stars get paid for anal and you're like, what?
*  Like you would imagine, like, don't they pay you a million dollars to do that? And they're like,
*  oh no, you know, 500 to 1500 sounds about right. Yeah, it's not a good deal.
*  So wait, do you realize then that you went from, like you just 180'd it, you went from pain to
*  pleasure. Your business was pain. And then your business became pleasure. Make motherfuckers hurt
*  to make motherfuckers laugh. No, your job as a fighter is to hurt the other person until you win.
*  Right, but you give pleasure to the people that watch.
*  The fight's going to happen with or without the audience, correct?
*  Whereas in comedy, it don't happen with or without you.
*  Yes, but there's always an audience. The only time there wasn't an audience, we did have fights
*  where people from other gyms or other dojos would come, a dojang, because it was Korean,
*  they would come and we would fight them. And there was no, I mean, full contact fights and there was
*  no, no referees. You're so bitch. You're butch. You're so butch, bro.
*  Butch, it's a funny word. You're so fucking butch.
*  It's so like, I read about fucking like, you know, superheroes pounding on each other and
*  you've literally hit people and been hit. You know what it feels like to take a punch. I've never
*  been hit in my life. This is not also me throwing that out into the universe. Look out for it.
*  Please don't fucking hit me. I'll probably get hit. I will offer to suck your dick before the punch
*  is thrown. Desperate to make you stop. That might be worse than hitting you.
*  Yeah, no kidding. I get bad blowjobs, but I've never been hit. All the stories I read about like
*  Green Arrow punches, where are all the stories I've written? Where fucking Daredevil punches
*  motherfucker. You've actually done the punching and received the fucking punch.
*  Yeah. It's pretty metal.
*  A lot of kicks.
*  It's butch, dude. That's bad.
*  Because my earliest martial art was Taekwondo, which is mostly kicking based. But yeah, I did
*  that was the first one.
*  Did a lot of that too. The kickboxing was one of the big turnaround too, because kickboxing
*  happened at the end of my Taekwondo career when I was realizing that Taekwondo was really limited.
*  And it was also the beginning of me doing comedy. It was all happening kind of at the same time.
*  And I just was really, really, really, really fortunate that I wanted to do stand-up comedy,
*  and I happened to be in Boston, which at the time was one of the hubs, one of the most creative
*  environments in the history of comedy. Oh my God. I mean-
*  All the people you hang out with, your crew.
*  Well, there was a lot of guys that you'll never hear about because they were genius,
*  but they stayed in Boston. But Bill Burr, he was a little bit after me, like a year or two after me,
*  and there's Patrice O'Neill, who's also in Bill Burr's group, and Nick DiPaolo.
*  There was fucking goddamn, I mean, there's so many guys that came out of that area.
*  You could just go on and on and on about the local headliners, but the environment,
*  Steven Wright came out of there.
*  He was in Boston?
*  Yeah, he's from that area. And there was guys you never heard of,
*  Lenny Clark, of course. But there's guys like Don Gavin and Steve Sweeney. To this day,
*  I think some of the best comedians I've ever seen in my life. And they were just local headliners
*  who were just masters. They just were just destroyers. And we got a chance to see those guys
*  when we were- Greg Fitzsimmons, who's another good buddy of mine who came out of that group.
*  We got to see those guys when we were amateurs, and we got to see these guys where they were just
*  destroying in a way that you didn't even think was possible. And we got a unique opportunity
*  as amateurs to be in this incredible environment where there are so many comedy clubs.
*  There were three comedy clubs in one area on Warranted Street. There was one where Nick's
*  comedy stopped, and then there was down the street, there was the comedy connection,
*  and above it there was a comedy club at the Charles Playhouse. And then across the street
*  there was Duck Soup. So there was four comedy clubs within a half a block. I mean, it was crazy.
*  It was just a boom of comedy. Then there were stitches, and there was just so many outside
*  bars and stuff that had stand up too. When did you realize you were funny?
*  Took 10 years. But Wendy, well enough to be like, I'm going to try stand up.
*  Yeah, I could get laughs. Were you funny as a fighter?
*  No, I was funny to my friends in the locker room or when we were on a bus traveling to
*  a tournament, everybody would be nervous. And I'd be the guy that made everybody laugh,
*  like gallows humor. I'd be doing impressions of each other. I had comedy for psychos. That's how
*  I thought of it. And my friend Steve Graham, who I'm very good friends with to this day,
*  he actually talked me into doing stand up. He was one of the ones, like, you should be a comedian.
*  And I'm like, look, I'm making you guys laugh because you're fucking crazy.
*  And other people are going to think I'm an asshole. This is not things that people think are funny.
*  It never occurred to you. You thought you were living room funny.
*  Yeah, I thought I was- Well, first of all-
*  I'm funny because I know these guys.
*  Mean. It was mean funny because fighting is a mean sport.
*  It's mean. You have to be mean if you want to be successful. And so some of my comedy was mean.
*  And then I didn't know about amateurs. I didn't understand. And then I went to an open mic night.
*  One of the things about going to an open mic night is you get to see the professionals who are
*  like the hosts and occasionally professional drop in and do a set, but you also get to see these
*  amateurs who are terrible. And you go, oh, I get it. So everybody sucks at first. And then,
*  you know, you could just go up with the people who suck and you suck too. And it was like,
*  okay, it was a huge relief because I thought of stand up. Oh my God. It's like
*  Richard Pryor or Jerry Seinfeld. Those are comics.
*  You gotta be a legend.
*  I can't do that. So I'd like probably I was faking that like I was trying to 21.
*  I went on to a comedy stage, not, you know, once when I was before I even made clerks,
*  when I was probably about 20 rascals had an open mic night and I tried to orange.
*  No, the one in Eaton town, right before between the Monmouth mall and the CV square mall.
*  Oh, okay.
*  And so I went up and I did like, like five minutes and the only bit that worked was a bit
*  about sucking my own dick. And I put that in clerks years later. I was like, oh, I remember
*  they laughed at that bit. I'll throw it in. But I remember trying it and I never told my friends,
*  this would be 1990. It was before I even saw slacker. And that was when I knew I wanted to
*  make clerks. So probably 1990 or 91 pre August. But it was like, it didn't, I remember being like,
*  well, I tried it, but I'll never do that again. And now I literally make my living being on stage,
*  fucking talking crazy. It was nuts. And it's, that's, that's why I'm like,
*  that's why I had my head around my grandfather. Like, how the fuck do you walk away from that?
*  Like, don't you feel great when you're up there and you're fucking killing and stuff like that?
*  I know it's like money, of course, is always a part of it. And it's nice to get what I would
*  consider overpaid to do the same shit I would fucking do anyway. Like I would be trying to be
*  funny regardless and shit, but don't you get the like, you definitely, it's definitely great to
*  kill. It's horrific to bomb and they're counterbalanced or as amazing as it feels to kill.
*  It feels equally horrific or maybe even more so to bomb. It'll haunt you. And then the thing about
*  doing well is you don't think about it while it's happening because while it's happening,
*  I'm thinking about my performance. I'm thinking about making sure that I'm in the zone with these
*  bits. You can stick the landing. Yes. I'm not thinking everybody loves me. I'm thinking,
*  okay, this bit, here's the peak, here's the valley, here's where I bring it up,
*  and here's where I hammer it home. And here comes the pause and then there's the punch.
*  And I'm also in the moment where I have to be, when I'm doing a bit, if I'm doing a bit on a clock
*  or something like that, I have to be thinking about a fucking clock. I'm not just saying those
*  words. I am thinking 100% about what I'm saying because if I don't, it doesn't work as good.
*  There's no way. You can't just say the words. It's a form of hypnosis. It's like a mass hypnosis.
*  And these people know those fucking animals out there in that crowd. They smell weakness. They
*  smell distraction. They smell when you're disconnected. They feel you like in the way
*  the avatar people do. There's a fucking... Thank you for using a movie reference so I could
*  understand. Yes. There's a thing that's happening that's undefined because the only people that
*  really understand it are the people who are real comics, who have been doing it a long time,
*  who know how to kill. And there's this thing that happens when everything is tight and everything's
*  in place, that is you're a ride and you're a passenger on the ride. You're not driving it.
*  You are in a sense that you have to do the work and you have to do the writing and you have to
*  perform. I have two shows tonight. I fucking hammer it out all the time. Tonight? Yeah.
*  Where are you going? Ice House? No, Comedy Store.
*  I was at the Comedy Store Sunday and I did an arena Saturday night in Cleveland. I did two shows
*  at the Fox Theater Friday. You gotta go, baby. You gotta go, go, go, go, go. Comedy is like running.
*  It's like anything else. You gotta be in shape. Yes. And you hate it.
*  And so you gotta do it all the time. You don't enjoy it. You don't...
*  No, I love it. You suck up the praise. That's what I'm saying. So when is the moment where you're like...
*  But it's not that because you can't think about that. Because if you think about that,
*  it's time that takes away from the actual thing. The actual thing deserves 100% of your attention
*  and the actual thing... I'm not saying you feel that in the moment,
*  but when do you fucking feel it? Like when you're like, good night, and everybody explodes.
*  Yeah, but even then I let it go. I just go, get it out of here. Then I start thinking about other shit.
*  Why? Because that's how I go. That's what makes me go. What makes me go is the thing.
*  I'm always concentrating on the thing. How do I get the thing better? How do I make it work better?
*  All right. So I concentrate on the thing, but then I fucking celebrate that like, holy shit,
*  I stuck the landing. If I do that with my friends right after this show, we have a great show.
*  Me and Santino, Saturday night, we had this fucking wild show at this arena in Cleveland.
*  It was awesome. After it was over, we high-five, we get something to eat, and that's it. Then you
*  let it go. You gotta let it go. Because my thinking is... I'm on literally on the road every night,
*  and it's like, even though it's a different show every night and it's a different, wonderful
*  audience, I'm still thinking about the two shows we had at the Music Box in the Chicago Theater.
*  I'm like, oh my God, it was religious. Of all the screenings I've ever had in my life, those two
*  will stick out. The thing is it's different too because you're playing a movie that you did.
*  You're putting out a piece and you get to sit down and watch people enjoy the piece, and you get to
*  get this big rush. Like, ah, look at that. Then I gotta go up and then do the fucking...
*  Yeah, but the Q&A is also... And what about them donuts thing?
*  But the Q&A is also organic. You're just being yourself. You're having a good time.
*  Definitely being yourself, but it's organic as you want it to be.
*  Yeah.
*  Like basically somebody asks you a question and you're like, here's a long answer. Maybe it had
*  nothing to do with that question. Right. But even then, it's like that... It's not like you're doing
*  a bit, you know, like where you have to begin your set. Thank you very much, Chicago. Great to be
*  here. Here's the thing about Chicago. Do you have memorized bits?
*  Oh yeah, there's bits, but they don't... I was always blown away by Carlin. One day we
*  were rehearsing on Dogma and George Carlin was... You know, we had a smoke break. It was the 90s,
*  so everybody smoked cigarettes and shit. And I was like, what are you working on now, George,
*  when you're not doing this? And everybody was in rehearsal. Matt, Ben, Linda, Salma, Chris Rock,
*  the whole fucking cast, me, Jay. And George is like, oh, I'm working on this bit for the new HBO
*  show. He goes, it's called Advertising Lullaby. And I said, what do you mean working on it? And
*  he goes, well, I'm memorizing it. And I was like, you memorize your bits? And he goes,
*  yeah, I write everything. I was like, you write your bits? I always just thought you kind of came
*  up with shit off the top of your head. He goes, are you nuts? He's like, I write everything and
*  then I have to memorize everything like a script. And then we were like, can you do it? And he's
*  like, yeah, you want to see it? And so he did a command performance for the eight of us in the
*  room of Advertising Lullaby. And it was pitch perfect. I saw the HBO show like, you know,
*  months later and it was pitch perfect. So I couldn't believe that that dude was as committed
*  to the written word as he was, but he fancied himself a writer first and foremost. He was a
*  guy that didn't even want to do comedy though. Like he really backed into it. He was, he wanted
*  to be Danny K. He wanted to act and stuff like that. And he was just happened to be funny. First,
*  he did the radio DJ thing and then the hippie weatherman burns and Allen was prior to that and
*  stuff, but he kind of backed into comedy and was excellent at it. But was not like, it was not like,
*  this is what I've always wanted to do since I was a kid. Just kind of, he always seemed to accept
*  the fact that he was like, Oh, I'm, this is it. I'm a genius at this. All right. Well, he did it
*  differently. He would do, I mean, he was probably the most prolific big name guy of all time. And
*  he, he actually inspired Louis CK to do a new hour every year because that's what he did.
*  Carlin. George did a new hour every year. And part of the reason why he did that is
*  275 nights a year. That's crazy. But part of the reason why is he owed a lot of money. He did a
*  big time debt. Yeah. I don't know how that happened, but in his book, last words, he talks about like
*  he bought a jet and sometimes he would buy a jet. He in the seventies, he was that fucking huge.
*  He bought a jet and he would sit on the runway in Long Island, um, at a, at a, uh, uh,
*  fucking LaGuardia. Yeah. And, uh, just do coke in the fucking plan. His book last words is amazing.
*  They published it posthumously, but he was working on it with Tony Hendra
*  before he died. He was so awesome, man. Like I think about them all the time. Anytime I jump on
*  stage, cause we, every night after reboot, we get up on stage and work the crowd and stuff.
*  I got a chance to say hello to him once. That was it. Yeah. Yeah. I met him at the comedy store.
*  It was very friendly. Said hi to everybody. Said hi to the door guys. Hey, how are you?
*  Said hi to me. Hey, hey, hey, George Garland. How are you? He didn't know who the fuck I was.
*  He had no idea. Just said hi. I said, Hey man, how you doing? And that's it. That was our thing.
*  I have a, I mean, I worked with him a few times in the movies and stuff. He, one of my favorite
*  fucking memories of George Garland is we go see him, um, do a show me and Chris rock. It was me
*  and my wife, Jen and Chris was married to his wife, Malak at that point. And George was playing at
*  Caesar's in Atlantic city. And so he's like, I got seats for you guys up front and stuff. So,
*  you know, rock was like, had his role with the new, he was like fucking at the height of his
*  game and shit. And so we go see the show and, and Carlin had a bit where he, uh, it was like people
*  I could do without like guys named skip shit like that. And one of them was people I could do without,
*  uh, uh, any man over the age of 12 who wears their baseball cap backwards. So, you know, long before
*  I met him, I'd always hear that gig at that bit and be like, ah, so the night we're at the show,
*  he's up there doing it bit. And, uh, and you know, he's like, uh, another person I could do without
*  Kevin, you're exempt from this guys over the age of 12 who wear their baseball cap backwards
*  and rock, like my eyes lit up and rocks next to me and rock goes, he knows who you are.
*  Even though like we'd worked together on the movie. It was so, it made you exempt though.
*  Uh, for the, for the show, cause I was there kind of sweet. He was, uh, he, he, I think we got along
*  because he, he wanted to act and I was always like, come act, come play. And like he, he's like,
*  and in just Jane's sound, Bob's strike back, he plays a hitchhiker that like blows people for rides.
*  Right. And the day he was such a committed actor, the day we shot it, we had him for a few hours and
*  then he had to rush off to go be on a stage and be Carl. So he made a little window of time for us.
*  And he came to me on set and he goes, uh, Kevin, you're the writer director of this. I have a
*  question for you. I was like, okay. And he goes, uh, you know, this, uh, it says that I'm fucking
*  with these dudes. I talked to him about the rules of the road. Am I fucking with these idiots or
*  do I believe in the rules of the road? And I was like, wow, I can't believe you're giving it this
*  much fucking thought George. I said, but like I, the way I wrote it, I assume the guy believed in
*  the rules of the road and he goes, that's what I thought. I was, that's exactly what I fucking
*  thought. He was so like committed to performance, man. Like, uh, he was an absolute joy to be around
*  and he was never on. He's like you like fucking not like, Hey man, how about them donuts? He
*  doesn't feel the needs to make you laugh. I love Tracy Morgan to death. Don't get me wrong, but like
*  you gotta save six hours for facial, you know, rehabilitation. Yes. Because you're just laughing
*  so hard. You're laughing and your face is in that rictus grin the entire fucking day. You ever made
*  John Witherspoon? Is he the same way? Oh my God. I did a show with John Witherspoon and his son JD
*  and my fucking face hurt after it was over. It was like cramped up. That's Morgan. Like my cheeks
*  were hurting. George was not that guy. He can just sit there and have a conversation with him. Like
*  he was just interesting. Do you know miss Pat? Do I know miss Pat? Do you know who she is? She's
*  another one. She'll make your fucking face hurt. Really? Oh my God. She's so funny. Her stories are
*  so crazy. She had a real crazy life. Oh yeah. What were your jams? Well Sam Kenison was my boy.
*  That's where I got the long coat for sound Bob from Sam Kenison. Well, I was introduced to comedy
*  through my parents having Cheech and Chong albums. Cheech and Chong. We have Chommy Chong is in Jay and
*  Sound Bob reboot. And then Bill Cosby. And then when I was- My dad gave me Bill Cosby albums and my mom
*  would always be like, you can't listen to George Carlin, but you can listen to Bill Cosby because
*  he's clean. Isn't that funny? In retrospect, how crazy is that? I mean, how crazy is that?
*  He had a stellar reputation. Oh my God. But you know, when I was on news radio, I had heard
*  that he drugged women. Did you really? Yes. Yes. I don't remember- That was the scuttlebutt at NBC?
*  Yes. Yes. The scuttlebutt was- And I might've heard it from Candy Alexander, who was always on top of
*  shit. She always had her fucking thumb to the pulse. But yeah, I'd heard. I'm going wide-eyed
*  because these are like rock star names. Yeah. I'd heard. I'd heard. Yeah. And I was like, what? And
*  they're like, hey, drugs women are fucked. Never mind him. Candy Alexander. That's a rock star name.
*  Oh, she's amazing. I love her. I love that lady to death. That lady quit news radio because she
*  wasn't getting a big enough part. I remember. Yeah. She's like, you know what? I don't need to do this.
*  She went off and wound up being on one of the CSI or something like that. Yeah. Was it CSI? She was
*  on a bunch of shit. She's been in a million different things. She's amazing. She's a powerful woman.
*  Every time I'm here, we talk about it, but like it was such an incredible assembly. Did you see
*  the 2020 that they did on Phil Hartman? No. They did like a couple weeks ago, like a whole hour,
*  20 minutes on Phil Hartman and stuff. I wouldn't watch it. When you didn't pop up in it, I was
*  like, that's very Joe Rogan to not be involved in this. I can't. I don't even know if they asked.
*  I don't remember. The other thing I wanted to ask you was the fucking moving, fast moving lights
*  that the air force was like, Oh, your video on, Oh, what were your thoughts? Well, did you hear
*  the moment I saw the video with commander David Fravor that I had? No. Okay. That's who you gotta,
*  you gotta watch that podcast because he's the guy that was there. He was in the plane. Yes. He was
*  the commander. He was the guy who was in the fucking plane. He said, whatever it was, it went from
*  60,000 feet to 50 feet in a matter of seconds. Do you see me lighting up like a child because
*  this is the shit. Remember in search of when we were kids, Leonard Nimoy, where they made you
*  fucking believe when we were children, we believed in Sasquatch. We believe in Loch Ness Moss. We
*  believe in aliens and then the internet got red. Yeah. The difference between this is what is this?
*  Whatever this object was, believe it or not believe it. Think that's something is off about it.
*  It was actively blocking and jamming radar and it moved at a preposterous speed. It went,
*  I don't remember how many miles they say like 30 miles inside of a second,
*  some insane amount of speed it traveled. They were trying to track this thing. They couldn't. I mean,
*  it was moving. No emissions. No emissions, no emissions, no method of propulsion that made any
*  sense. No drone technology of any kind. They don't know what the fuck it was, but they had seen several
*  of them and the people around that area in San Diego off the coast of Mexico, the air force people
*  had seen several of them. Fuck, this is thrilling. I remember seeing this in the day. This was in the
*  news and I was like, why is this not like the front page fucking news story? New York Times wrote a big
*  piece about it, but you need to watch the podcast with commander David Fravor. That's the one.
*  David Fravor was the guy who was in the vehicle. He saw it with his own eyes. He observed it with
*  the tracking equipment in the plane and he looked at it with his own eyes. He said it looked like a
*  tic tac. That guy is not full of shit and he is a high level military guy. He doesn't have a long
*  history of this. He's not seeking attention. It was very difficult to get him to do this in the
*  first place. Jeremy Corbell who made that documentary, Bob Lazar in Area 51, Flying Saucers,
*  that was a humbling experience listening to him talk about it because you could tell
*  he's not full of shit. He's telling you about a real experience he had that is impossible to
*  describe and the fact that this thing was actively jamming radar. People could say it's a this or
*  it's a that or it's an anomaly. What do they say? It was actively jamming radar. The skeptics want
*  to think that oh they moved it to 2x zoom and that's why it looks like it took off quick. No,
*  they couldn't track it. They couldn't stay on it. It was moving too fast. It didn't make any sense.
*  It took off at a preposterous rate of speed and more importantly it was actively jamming radar.
*  It was using equipment to jam their radar. On purpose. Yes. So not just like it couldn't be
*  like perhaps whatever created whatever its energy signature was created of radar. It was doing
*  something to jam the radar. It knew that they were trying to track it. It didn't want to be found.
*  Exactly. It was like fuck off. What do you think it is? Fuck off with your nonsense. I think it's
*  from another planet. That's what I think. Come on. Keep talking boy. It's either from another
*  dimension or it's from another planet. Wait, what? It's more likely that it's from another planet
*  and I think. Hold on. What do you mean another dimension? Well we don't have any idea. I mean
*  how many dementias are there? We know what we can see and feel. Here's the thing. When you see an
*  ant, right? And ants moving around the ground and you hold a cell phone over that ant. Does it have
*  any idea what the fuck that is? No it doesn't. This is why I make the trip out here. It doesn't.
*  It doesn't have any idea because it's outside of its realm of understanding and it's entirely
*  possible that if something lives a million years longer than human beings have existed and it
*  continues to innovate and continues to create new technology. They can make technology that is
*  indistinguishable from sorcery. If you think about the way Bob Lazar explained it when he was working
*  at Area 51. It's like if you took a nuclear reactor of today and showed it to some people
*  from the Victorian era, they would think that it was magic and this is exactly how we were approaching
*  these recovered crafts because they were trying to back engineer according to Bob Lazar believe
*  him or not. They were trying to back engineer these crafts and they were saying that these crafts were
*  operating on something called element 115 which we didn't even know was a real thing. I mean they
*  had speculated that it existed but he was talking about this in the late 80s and the 90s. Well they
*  didn't even absolutely prove that element 113 or 115 was real until I think it was 2013. So he's
*  talking about something that the Air Force or the Navy or whoever the fuck was operating Area 51 and
*  S4 where he was that they had this knowledge and understanding of this element that they had
*  somehow or another made stable that could bend gravity, it could change gravity. So instead of
*  being a propulsion system where you have a fire that comes out of the back of a thing and it forces
*  the thing forward, this thing just pushed gravity in front of it and it shot through insane amounts
*  of space and time with incredible speed that didn't even make any sense and they didn't understand how
*  they made it. They couldn't back engineer it. So pushing gravity would, that's what we're giving.
*  You have to listen to him describe it. I'm butchering it. A lighting that would push it up but
*  then it also gives it gives it propulsion as well. I'm butchering it for sure but the way he was
*  describing it there was something about this element 115 that you utilized it when it was
*  inside of the spaceship it utilized gravity in some sort of an impossible to understand way
*  that they still have not figured out and he saw it in action. He saw it in action and he was a
*  propulsion expert from Los Alamos and he had worked on propulsion systems during his own
*  free time and he had worked on some nuclear projects at Los Alamos that was in the middle
*  of concocting some top secret military shit and he's clearly a brilliant guy but so many people
*  try to discredit him and maybe they're right and maybe I don't know. I believe a lot of what he's
*  saying. If they are aliens do you want to be here when they make contact? Well I think they're making
*  contact whether we like it or not. That's what I think. I think they're looking and watching
*  whether we like it or not. They're observing and I think if you were an intelligent being from
*  another planet you would want to make sure that the territorial monkeys don't blow each other up
*  and that's what we are. We're like this adolescent stage of evolution where we still have all of our
*  primal territorial jungle instincts but yet we also have this insane ability to harness the atom.
*  We also have this ability to send videos through space. I mean we can catch them on your phone and
*  play it back and forth. We hold energy in these little rectangular devices that we hold in our
*  pocket. We charge them and we're charging them with fucking nuclear power that's you know
*  nuclear power plants are charging our phones and then the phones go into our pockets and then
*  we're like real close you know. We're real close to a lot of this crazy technological innovation
*  and it keeps getting more and more spectacular with every passing generation and they're probably
*  watching. They're probably watching and waiting and trying to figure out what the fuck we're
*  doing and if you believe what they told Bob Lazar that they were responsible for an accelerated
*  evolution. Wait wait wait wait wait wait come on too much information. One of the things they were
*  saying. Who's they? When he was working for what is he working for the air force was it the air force
*  that Lazar was working for? Whatever whatever the government body that was operating area s4
*  they gave him a bunch of breakdowns on a lot of things they do and what where they think they
*  got these crafts from and where the crafts are. One of them was from an archaeological dig he said
*  but they gave him an explanation of what these aliens are here for and what they're doing
*  and one of the things that they said and he said I have no method of verifying whether or not this
*  is true or not but that they had accelerated the evolution of primitive primates. So they had taken
*  primitive primates and they had done something to them to change them from a primitive being
*  to what we have now in Homo sapiens and they did it very quickly. If you really look at evolution
*  the difference between Australiopithecus and Homo sapien it's only a few hundred thousand years
*  which is insane. If you if you think of how much more advanced we are than those lower hominids
*  and there's no other animal that's experienced that kind of a leap. The human brain doubled in
*  brain size over a period of two million years. We have no idea how we have no idea what happened.
*  It's all speculation whether it's eating meat, controlling fire, using tools, hunting,
*  increased access to protein, changing from herbivores to omnivores to carnivores,
*  all these different theories. The throwing arm that's another theory that humans figured out a
*  way to use an arm to throw and hit things and that accelerated our problem-solving skills.
*  There's a lot of theories. We don't know. Terrence McKenna had a theory called the
*  stoned ape theory. He believed that human beings were experimenting with psilocybin mushrooms
*  and that psilocybin mushrooms accelerated our evolution. Who knows? We don't know. But
*  one of the things that they were telling Lazar when he was working at S4 back engineering these
*  crafts were that human beings were the product of accelerated evolution and that these space beings
*  and that there was more than one there was more than one civilization that was involved in this.
*  These space beings had had some sort of a hand in this running experiment that is the evolution
*  of man. So then, you know, that's true or not, who the fuck knows? Totally. So everyone's like,
*  we might be in a simulation. We're not. But at the same time, we could be somebody simulation.
*  We could be a simulation too. I mean, Elon believes we're in a simulation. Yeah. And, you know,
*  I had a philosopher on that was trying to explain to me the likelihood of a simulation and his,
*  what was his name again? How do you say it? Nick Bostrom. His perception was that if you look at
*  the laws of probability, it's more likely that we are in a simulation than we're not. And that was
*  really hard for my stupid brain to accept. That if you look at the amount of planets that there are,
*  if you look at the Fermi paradox, like where are these planets? If you look at the insane
*  number of stars just in our galaxy alone, and then the insane number of galaxies in the universe,
*  what are the odds that a life form hasn't gotten to the point where it can create a simulation
*  that's indistinguishable from reality? Well, the odds are very small. So if the odds are more likely
*  that something has created a simulation that's indiscernible from reality, the odds are very
*  likely that we're in it right now. If we're in a simulation, like we're in a pretty good
*  version of it. You and I are kicking ass. Yeah. We're doing great in the video game. Exactly.
*  You're doing well as well. Thumbs up. Like not bad. Like considering it, like in the simulation,
*  we were allowed to climb from a place to another place. Yeah. We were making progress. We're having
*  fun. I mean, we're not just playing fucking pitfall. No. We're actually, we're Sims.
*  Right. Think about what you were saying about loving being on stage and that great feeling of
*  having all these people that have been entertained by your art, you know, and be able to sit there
*  and watch what you create, be able to sit there and watch your movie and you be able to sit there
*  and watch all these people laugh at your work. That's crazy. That's a crazy great thing. And
*  so much better than your grandfather who was a janitor, you know, think about that,
*  that is so much less rewarding. Your life is infinitely more rewarding and more fortunate.
*  Was he in the simulation as well then? I'm sure. Maybe that's the, I don't know.
*  Or in the simulation, is it just like the give them some backstory? So I didn't really have a
*  grandfather. It's all speculation. Who knows? Who knows? Who knows that it changes every day?
*  I mean, when you wake up, you assume that these fucking weird cloudy memories of the past are
*  all realistic. You know, we don't know. We don't even know if you ever have really gone to sleep.
*  We just know you have this memory of every night going to sleep. We don't really know.
*  What do you mean? It was why you're awake right now. How the fuck do you know that
*  what you've experienced in your past, all of it wasn't just simulated like, and if it is simulated,
*  wouldn't sleep be simulated as well? Wouldn't all of it be simulated? If you are just in this state,
*  this state of perpetual simulation where everything is existing all at once, but your mind puts it in
*  this context of the day to day grind, get up in the morning. I got to hustle. I got to go out there
*  and go out, get after it. Maybe it's all nonsense. Maybe you're all in this eternal neuro neurological
*  concoction, some thing that's forcing your brain to interact with these ideas and memories as if
*  they're real. It's unfair that I'm the only one stoned because this is stoner talk. This is good.
*  Stoned for so many years. I'm probably permanently stoned.
*  Even in a sober October. Yeah, something probably take me months to completely dry out. If I took a
*  test, I'd probably. You didn't answer my question. Do you want to be here with the aliens? Yes,
*  for sure. Really? Yeah. What if they're hostile? We are hostile. So you think we could take them?
*  Nope. No. I mean, are the chimps going to take over the earth? No. Vaping vaporize those chimps.
*  Movie, you see. We've fucking gunned those chimps down. And so wait, would we gun down
*  the alien invader or would they have better technology? I don't think so. They'd probably
*  be able to control us. Our minds? Yeah, but control. Just control everything. They're probably
*  impossible to even isolate. It could probably just take off and be gone. Like if you pointed a gun
*  at them, they'd probably just disappear and be on the other side of the earth in a matter of seconds.
*  I mean, we're talking about technology that's indistinguishable from magic.
*  Right. How do you sound like Thor, man? That's what they said in Thor.
*  Did they? Yeah, yeah. Like Thor and they were like,
*  science and magic, what's the difference? Well, that is something that they've always said.
*  I'm not saying anything unique. That's one of the things they've said about a certain level
*  of technology. Like when you achieve a certain level of technology. I think it's a famous quote.
*  Azimuth. But it has nothing to do with Thor. It has something to do with scientists.
*  No. That's just said. They borrowed it.
*  That certain level of technology is indistinguishable from magic.
*  Yeah, I think that's an Azimuth or Azimuth. I don't even know.
*  Yeah, someone like that. But if you hit a certain level of technology that's
*  beyond your comprehension. I mean, look, man, if you could just go to the 1800s with an iPhone,
*  you'd be a fucking sorcerer, right? True.
*  Arthur C. Clarke, there you go. Any sufficiently advanced technology is
*  indistinguishable from magic. Clarke's first law. There it is. That's it.
*  That's the dude that wrote 2001.
*  Yes.
*  Was that it? He wrote that, right? Didn't he write? Well, Kubrick made the movie.
*  He made the movie, but I think Arthur-
*  Did he write it?
*  Clarke wrote it. But then again, I was like, Azimuth.
*  Yep. 2001, Space Odyssey.
*  Ooh, I got one.
*  What a great fucking movie that was. He wrote the screenplay.
*  What do you think happens then? All right, so if we're in a simulation and we die,
*  then we just cease to exist as a program. If we're not in a simulation, if we're organic,
*  little meat puppets and stuff, what's your take on the afterlife? Does it just end?
*  I think any speculation about that, any speculation is just that. It's just speculation.
*  You could just jerk yourself off all day trying to figure out what happens when you die.
*  That's kind of the idea.
*  You know, Richard Dawkins, I had him in here last week and he was like,
*  I think the lights go out and that's it. Do you think the lights go out?
*  He's almost like challenging you. I'm like, I don't know. I don't think you know either.
*  It's not romantic enough. You know what I'm saying? But at the same time, it might just be me
*  being arrogant going like, no, no, I can't just, the lights can't just go out.
*  Well, no one knows. No one knows. You have not experienced it. So even his reductionist
*  view of it is pure speculation. He just decided to make it simple and logical.
*  I got close. When I had my heart attack, I was, the doctor said, you got a 80,
*  you got to have an a widow maker. He goes, that means an 80% of the cases of 100% occlusion,
*  the patient always dies. He's like, but you're going to be the 20% because I'm good at my job.
*  And that's when he disappeared in my crotch, punched a hole, made it, made magic. So Dr. Mark
*  Leidenheim, if you're going to have a heart attack, find this guy. I went to get a physical for Jane
*  Sombab, reboot before you can make a movie. If you're the director, they make you and if
*  you're the actors too, they make you get a physical and make sure you're not going to die
*  during production. So I saw this doctor, Dr. Paula, who like I've seen for years, whenever I
*  make a movie, she's the movie physical doctor. And when I came in, she was like, oh my God,
*  you don't know how lucky you are. And I was like, I know everyone's been telling me I'm lucky. And
*  she was like, no, no, no, let me tell you a story. She's like me, two other heart surgeons, working
*  on a heart patient in a hospital in the emergency room, suddenly heart attack. And I was like, guy
*  had another heart attack. She goes, no, the other doctor drops to the floor, has a massive heart
*  attack, widow maker like yours. And I was like, well, I guess if you're going to have a heart
*  attack, I have one in the hospital surrounded by doctors, man. They couldn't save them. That's she
*  goes, my, I said, you save them. She goes, that's the point. We couldn't save them. Holy shit.
*  She's going, we had all the equipment, we had all the expertise and you know, all of us were trained,
*  but like, but the widow maker, it's not like if I'm good at my job, I can save this motherfucker.
*  It's not even 50 50. There's just like, there's no logic to it. It'll just go.
*  So she was like, so bad. I can't continue this conversation. Talk to Jamie for one minute.
*  Done. Done. Part of, part of the pride in, in doing Rogan's show, like is not having to pee.
*  I must have had too earlier, but I'm, did you really, you're holding it for me? Yeah. And I'm
*  all good. Um, I, while I got a chance, the weed, ladies and gentlemen, which camera's mine? I can
*  share that with you. Fucking A. I'm not in sober October. You're not doing, you're not taking part?
*  Definitely not. You're going to smoke some of this son. It's called Snugans. It's called a
*  Berserker. This is the hybrid. Let's do a Sativa since I still have work to do. The Sativa? Oh my
*  God. You're going to love it, man. It's going to fucking give you the wake up. Awesome. Um,
*  and there's a little comic strip. It's inside each one, like a bazooka Joe. Awesome. Um, that came
*  from a man, Mike at Caviar. Um, this is definitely, you could find it at a Barium. You can find it in
*  a bunch of weed legal States, Snugans, Snoochie, Boochies and Berserker. Uh, also more importantly,
*  Jane, Sam, Bob reboot. I'm going to use this opportunity while he's taking a piss cause I
*  just get lost. I'll let him roam and I'm supposed to be selling shit, but I'm like, tell me about
*  the aliens joke. This is why I come here to be entertained one-on-one. Um, but Jane, Sam, Bob
*  reboot man is, uh, if you want to go see me, the movie with me and Jay, we're traveling for the
*  next 55 weeks, 55 dates. Sorry, not weeks with the movie, uh, up until February. You watch it with
*  us. We do Q and a it's a good time, man. Reboot road show.com. That's the address for tickets and
*  stuff. It's also opening in all the areas that we've went. So we went to Jersey, Chicago, um, uh,
*  Detroit grand Rapids last week, and then it opened in Chicago, New Jersey. Yeah. Uh, and, uh, in
*  Illinois, New Jersey and Michigan play in theater. So this week, November 1st, it's opening on a
*  bunch of screens, um, following the places that we've actually went to. So let me see, um,
*  opening November 1st, uh, Minneapolis at AMC Arbor lakes, Houston at the AMC Willowbrook and
*  the AMC golf point 30 in Columbus, Ohio at the gateway film center in Des Moines at the century
*  W Des Moines Jordan Creek in St. Louis at the AMC West all of San Antonio at the regal
*  Cielo Vista. So every place we go with the movie, me and Jay, then the movie opens up in our wake.
*  So if you don't, if you don't want to see it with us at reboot road show.com, you can go to
*  fan dango.com. Just enter James on Bob reboot and see if it's playing near you. It's a good time.
*  It's a heartwarming film. Every night for me going to watch this movie is like being in
*  church where I'm the priest and also the person they're celebrating.
*  Have you made a deal with, uh, iTunes or Amazon or
*  Saban films has the movie domestically and they've got an output deal with somebody,
*  I think Amazon and then, uh, universal has the movie abroad. We're opening in the UK,
*  November 29th or something like that. I'm going over there at Thanksgiving. Yeah. No, I got some
*  man. You saw you, um, to tour there as well for a week in England. So, um, so it's got homes and
*  stuff, but we, the reason we go out on tour was cause you know, like you, I got an audience man,
*  I can count on the audience and I live off that audience. Like normally me and Jay are just out
*  there. I'm doing Q and a or, or stand up or whatever. So like going out with the movie,
*  like the budget of the movie was like, we, you know, we shot it in new Orleans. So it's like
*  10 million, but you get money back. So it's like 8 million and we needed 8 million bucks.
*  So we got some money from Saban for the domestic rights. We got some money from universal for the
*  overseas rights, but then there was equity financing. We had to pull together like a missing
*  two, 3 million bucks to make up the budget and stuff. And that's where you get money from real
*  people. People who are like, I'm going to invest in a movie and hope I get my money back or if not
*  make it and stuff. And those people always get fucked in this business, never make their money
*  back ever. But the tour, like I was able to assure those people I'm like within one year of the date
*  we start the movie, you're going to get your money back. Um, because I knew I could take the movie out
*  on tour and as long as I was willing to live with it, we can get all that equity financing back. So
*  one year from the date of my heart attack, we started shooting Jane, Silent Bob reboot as a big
*  fuck you to the heart attack. One year from the date we started shooting Jane, Silent Bob reboot,
*  I'm going to be able to pay off my equity investors. That's fucking unheard of in this
*  business, but I only get to do that because of the audience that we built up because the audience
*  will come out and support us. And like I was told a long time ago, like if you work for the audience,
*  you'll never work a day in your life. And it's absolutely fucking true. I've had not a boss.
*  And then I meet the bosses every night at the show and they're beautiful. Like they're fantastic.
*  They are my boss. They give me money, just like a boss gives you money and shit. And they'll let
*  you know if you're fucking up, you know, the audience will fucking tell you your boss will
*  let you know. But it's this tour with this movie, like we banged out a tiny record because we don't
*  have marketing money. It's one thing to get money to make the movie. Then it usually costs double
*  what you spent to make the movie to market the movie, to tell people it's coming, to put it up
*  on screens and shit. So we were lucky enough to get the 8 million to make the movie. We're going
*  to get fucking 15 to market the movie. That's crazy. And that's generally what happens. So
*  we just had to be smarter about it. And since I tour anyway with the podcast, I'm like, oh,
*  let's use this fucking model and expand it. So we hit a little record with our opening weeks.
*  We did the opening day of the tour was in New Jersey at Asbury Park at the Paramount. And we
*  did like 93,000 on one screen. So we got the record that week for like a limited opening or
*  something like that. And you know, every headline was like, you know, Jameson, Bob Reboot beat
*  Avengers Endgame in this one record. And you know, it's one of those things you send your mom and
*  you're like, just read the headline. Don't read the rest of the article and feel like really smart
*  business wise and stuff. And so me and Jordan Monsanto is Jason's wife. She's the kind of
*  the brains of our operation. We thought like we could count on the audience. We'll take the
*  movie out on tour and stuff like that. And it's really been working out. And it's nice that like
*  some business people are being like, Hey, good job. Like people are going like, oh, they figured
*  out their niche and they've been doing, we've been doing this for years. We did it with the red state
*  years ago. Remember we toured that as well. So it's great if you got like most filmmakers wouldn't
*  bother because they're like, I'm just gonna put in a bunch of theaters and shit and let the studio
*  pay for it. And I don't have a studio. So I got to take my movie to the people and for wallet. But
*  I'll be honest with you, like I started as an indie filmmaker. So that's in my blood. And there's
*  something insanely gratifying about sitting there with the audience. I never had that early in my
*  career. They just put the movie on a bunch of screens. You hear number wise how you did being
*  in the room. It seems like you just, you miss out on all the stress of all the other aspects of
*  moviemaking. The worst, the thing I used to hate the most man is you spend your time trying to make
*  a movie. You dream like, Oh, I see it up on the silver screen. You have these movie dreams and
*  shit. And then you have to make it a reality. If you're lucky, you get to make the movie a reality.
*  If you're lucky, it gets a release. If you're lucky, you spend opening weekend, not celebrating
*  like we fucking did it. We, we did a thing that not everybody ever fucking does. And who are we?
*  We're chimps and we figured it out, but instead we'd spend every fucking waking moment of opening
*  weekend going, how much does it make? Who's going? Are people going? Like it's not making enough.
*  Fuck. We got to drive more business. And suddenly the joy of what you were seeking is fucking gone
*  because you're mired in the business. And if you're the, if you're lucky, if you're the Avengers,
*  you get a month at the box office. That's about it. Before everyone moves on to something else.
*  If you're a Kevin Smith movie, you don't even get a weekend. You get a day if you're fucking lucky.
*  And so suddenly all that dreaming took me five years to make this movie and living through a
*  fucking heart attack comes down to one day at the box office. Fuck that man. Like tilt the table
*  in your favor. So I said, I'm going to take myself out of that box office race and instead do this.
*  Like what I'm losing in, in, well, I don't have marketing and stuff, but when I'm losing in a mass
*  release of the movie, I make up for it by being able to accompany the movie myself. And that makes
*  it a premium event. It eventizes it. It's an idea that I stole from Eddie is there. I remember when
*  I fell in love with that, he is, it's stuff. I was like, Eddie is there's literally just doing
*  fucking standup in a big theater with a costume on, like he's just doing standup that you would do
*  with the fucking improv and stuff. But like he eventized it. He turned it into something. It's
*  a one man show as opposed to like, he's doing 90 minutes of standup. So for us, we were like,
*  let's take the movie on the road and eventize it. If you're next to the movie, people like,
*  oh shit, the director's there. If I bring Jed, like, oh shit, Jane, Silent Bob are there as well.
*  So it's been like a blast, but you just have to be willing to put the time in. And, and you know,
*  some people are like, yeah, you could do this, but I'm like, yeah, we could do it because we've been
*  doing it for like a quarter, man, 25 years since clerks happened. And from day one, I've been
*  engaged with the audience long before it was like fashionable or profitable just because
*  why else wouldn't I want to like in the early beginnings, I was like my friend Ming Chen,
*  the guy from comic book men, he built a website and I was like, can you put up like a thing where
*  I could do Q and a all the time with the video? Is that possible? He goes, no, because it was like
*  1990, 95. And he goes back and put up a message board. And it was like a whiteboard, like Reddit.
*  He's like, people could put up as long before Reddit existed, people could put up messages,
*  and then you could look at them anytime you want three in the morning, you can respond to them.
*  And I realized I'm never going to fucking be alone again in this life, man. I'll always be
*  able to reach out to somebody who's like, Hey, man, I saw your movie, I got a question for you.
*  And boom, there's a connection and shit like that. So since 95, I've been in it like online with the
*  audience. Like, and I remember when I started, it was me and Peter Jackson were the only two
*  filmmakers on the web. And then Peter Jackson got smart. And it's like, if I'm on the web,
*  I win an Oscars and he went off and had a great career. I'm still on the fucking web because I
*  love connecting with the people that, that you're trying to reach. Like, you know, I don't do it in
*  a vacuum going like, like good filmmakers, like David Fincher, they make a thing and they put a
*  movie out there and they don't fucking go follow it. They let the movie speak for itself. I'm the
*  other guy who's like, when the movie's done, I run out. I'm like, hold on, let me tell you the story
*  of how it all fucking happened and shit. But people love it. It's, it's, it's a little niche.
*  Yeah, it's a different vibe. And it works incredibly well for us. So the tour
*  every night last week was like fucking sold out and it just felt like amazing. And as the tour
*  unrolled unrolls, we were going to fly from place to place. And then I was like, let's just fucking
*  drive. Let's do a punk style. So we've been driving around. Yeah, we got a little SUV and
*  we've been trucking around and it's fucking glorious, man. I'm 49. You don't get this at
*  49. This is the shit you're supposed to do in your twenties, but like post heart attack. Now I'm like,
*  well, like post heart attack, I didn't go crazy where I'm like, give me all the pussy in the world
*  and shit. Like nothing really changed for me, but I did become very cognizant of like, you know,
*  my wife hates when I say it, but I'm like, I'm living on borrowed time. I know for a fact,
*  my old man fucking died after the second heart attack. We're all living on borrowed time act
*  accordingly. I'm just acutely aware of it because I was so fucking close to the moment. So it's not
*  so much like I'm having a midlife crisis, not by any stretch of the imagination, but like anything
*  that allows you to feel like young vital makes you feel like, oh yeah, this is why I started
*  shit like this or is fun. Like we're making a living and I'm, it's crazy. Like we're on the road
*  all the time and I've been saying all week, like this is the best vacation I've had in years,
*  even though we're working sometimes three times, three shows in a day,
*  because it never feels like work. I'm just driving around. My whole job is to like go to a theater
*  and fucking show the movie to people and stuff. It's really fucking dope. That's awesome, man.
*  I'm happy for you. Thank you. You always are, man. I am, I am always, um, how was the piss?
*  It was great. I needed it. I know you always get there as long as I could. Um, it's trying to get
*  weird pains. That's like, you don't want it. Not at our age. I couldn't concentrate. You want,
*  you want good steady flow. What I'm walking away from this session with you is, um, that, that I,
*  no bullshit. I think when I'm done with the tour, I'm going to start working out. Yeah. But not
*  like, you know, get your big and shit. Yeah. Don't get crazy. Just some muscles. I think I need to
*  do, let me see. I'm 49. I turned 50 in August. I gotta be able to do a fucking pull up before.
*  You can do that. That's totally achievable. Strength training. Where were you in high school?
*  Like I could have used that kind of like, you can do that, Kev instead of everyone's like fucking
*  fatty, get off the bar and shit. Some people have a different approach. They were. I know you've got
*  that Zen Yoda, Yoda Rogan approach. Uh, where's your, where's your show tonight? A comedy store.
*  Two shows. You got, you know, you're going to do. Yeah. You're working it. Do you do the same show
*  both times? No, no. I have some new stuff that I have to work in. So I'll try to figure out how to
*  do it. These shows in town. It's a lot of fucking around. What percentage will repeat? Depends.
*  I do have a killer bit where you're like, I'm going to open with this and then I'll try the new stuff.
*  You always try to open with something that's proven. That works. But sometimes not. Sometimes
*  there's a thought that gets in my head, like right before I go up, I'm like, let's see what this works.
*  So wait a second. How many stores a gym basically to work out? Yeah. I mean you get paid, but really
*  it's a gym. You're probably at a point in your career now where you don't even have to like come
*  up with shit to do on like late nights because you don't even have to do. When was the last time you
*  did like a late night thing? Yeah. I don't do those too often. I was going to say like you've got your
*  own fucking audience. Those people can love you. Do you figure you cracked the code? You like you,
*  you built a thing and you were like, I'm going to build my own thing. You're like the Cohen brothers
*  of this bitch. Cohen brothers. Like we're like, we're going to do our own thing and it's fucking
*  weird and it doesn't work like your thing at all, but we're going to stand over here and we're going
*  to keep doing it. And slowly the whole industry gravitated toward them. They stood outside of it
*  and then everybody started doing their sensibility, their sense of humor, their type of casting.
*  You're the same fucking thing you, you built. And I watched it in fucking real time. You built a thing
*  and you were content to be like, I'm happy with this. Like I don't need to fucking chase this or
*  that I'm building a thing. And now you're, you've been rewarded by being at a place where you don't
*  have to like go anywhere to promote whatever it is you want to do. You literally do it fucking here,
*  feeding your own machine. Think about it. Instead of jumping on some tonight show or something like
*  that and giving them ratings, you feed your own beast by being like, Oh, I'm going to be here.
*  Come see the show. You know, it's really crazy. I don't even do that. What do you mean? I don't
*  talk about my gigs. I just do it through social media. You never, you never on this very rarely.
*  Bill Maher does it at the end of every episode. He's always like, Hey man, I'm going to a gig
*  tonight. He doesn't have social media. I don't think he does. He's not on it very strongly.
*  I just post stuff up on Instagram. That's what I do too, man. I would assume with this. It's like,
*  you know, you could just, yeah, I mean, I talk about it casually. Like, uh, I'm in Houston
*  and then, uh, no Dallas on November 15th and Houston on the 16th. There we go. I just did it.
*  I didn't want to force you into it, man, but.
*  Oh, listen, man, I'm, I'm, I'm, I love what you do. I love the fact that you're living in this vibe.
*  You know, you've got this thing that you're doing where you make your films, you promote your films,
*  you go on tour with them. And I like that you switch it up too. Like red state is one of my
*  favorite movies, man. I fucking loved that movie because it was so crazy. I didn't have any idea
*  what to expect when I sat down to see that, but I love that you've got that sort of artistic
*  freedom. You do what seems like a thing to do. And you know, it's masturbatory, I guess on some
*  level. It's creative is what it is. As long as people enjoy watching me masturbate. I'm
*  I think people like watching you beat off, you know, tip my jar. Yeah. You know, I'm a cam,
*  cam kid. Thank you, brother. Thank you for having me. Kevin Smith, ladies and gentlemen. Goodbye.
