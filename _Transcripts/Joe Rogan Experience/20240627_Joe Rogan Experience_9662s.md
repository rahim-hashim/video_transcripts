*  Yeah. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=19.6s)]
*  Where'd you go? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=20.6s)]
*  The Jets versus the Cowboys. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=21.6s)]
*  Oh. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=22.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=23.6s)]
*  Wait. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=24.6s)]
*  In Dallas. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=25.6s)]
*  Yeah, Cowboys. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=26.6s)]
*  That would just happen, right? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=27.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=28.6s)]
*  And it was Sunday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=29.6s)]
*  Yeah, a week ago. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=30.6s)]
*  A week ago. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=31.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=32.6s)]
*  It was fucking awesome. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=33.6s)]
*  How many people does that place seat? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=34.6s)]
*  That one's probably close to 100. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=35.6s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=37.8s)]
*  80 plus for sure. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=38.800000000000004s)]
*  80 plus. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  That place is fucking amazing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=41.800000000000004s)]
*  I've never seen an NFL game live. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  I'm so into football, man. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=43.800000000000004s)]
*  I get it now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=45.28s)]
*  I'm so into it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=46.28s)]
*  Bro, I get it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=47.28s)]
*  I'm friends with Aaron Rodgers and I don't even watch football. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=48.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=50.88s)]
*  And Aaron was supposed to play, but then Aaron blew out his Achilles tendon. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=51.88s)]
*  Real bad. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=55.64s)]
*  Yeah, first drive of the first game. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=56.64s)]
*  All this hype, like the craziest shit, all this hype about Aaron Rodgers going to the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=59.28s)]
*  Jets. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=63.28s)]
*  And the crazy thing is they had drafted like a year or two before that Zach Wilson, who [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=64.44s)]
*  was like a number one draft pick. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=69.08s)]
*  He was supposed to be the new quarterback that was going to take the Jets to the Super [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=70.8s)]
*  Bowl, but he's had a miserable last couple of years. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=75.0s)]
*  And so instead of giving up on him, the Jets said, okay, let's bring in Aaron Rodgers because [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=79.92s)]
*  Green Bay was moving on from Aaron Rodgers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=86.48s)]
*  They got this guy love, eventually, like all the legends, eventually their last couple [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=89.16s)]
*  years they play on another team like Tom Brady, Peyton Manning. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=93.6s)]
*  The last couple of years they go to a different team and sometimes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  You gotta be a Peyton. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=102.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=103.44s)]
*  That's a lot of money. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=104.44s)]
*  I get it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=105.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=106.92s)]
*  And then the first drive, after all that hype with Aaron Rodgers and New York City, it was [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=107.92s)]
*  huge and then boom, he's gone for the season. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=113.2s)]
*  Yeah, he thinks he'll be back in six months. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=116.16s)]
*  He said it's usually six to 12 months, but he said that's for vaccinated people. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=119.48s)]
*  But then my Browns, you know, I'm following the Browns every day in the offseason, undrafted [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=126.72s)]
*  free agents, the fucking draft, everything. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=134.52s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=137.12s)]
*  Practice. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=138.12s)]
*  You're all in, huh? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=139.12s)]
*  I'm all in. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=140.12s)]
*  I love it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=141.12s)]
*  I love it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=142.12s)]
*  Every player has their own mission, you know, and the quarterback needs to know as many [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=143.6s)]
*  of those missions as possible. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=147.96s)]
*  He needs to know what's going on. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=149.4s)]
*  But everyone else, they just need one mission. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=151.28s)]
*  They got one mission. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=153.16s)]
*  Every player, everybody's doing something different. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=154.52s)]
*  Is incredible to watch. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=156.72s)]
*  And then there's all these coaches. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=157.72s)]
*  I'm actually friends with, do you remember, do you remember there was a Sports Illustrated [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  article on a football coach that was an offensive line coach that was teaching jiu jitsu to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=164.72s)]
*  NFL players to help them in the offensive line? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=172.96s)]
*  That's Scott Peters from the Cleveland Browns. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=175.36s)]
*  Yeah, there's an article on it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=178.0s)]
*  And I remember reading it a couple of years ago. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=179.56s)]
*  What would help with jiu jitsu? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=181.44s)]
*  Just being able to clinch, understanding how to throw bodies around? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=183.28s)]
*  I think, I think so. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=186.64s)]
*  Wrestling. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=188.64s)]
*  Wrestling seems like it would help a lot. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=189.64s)]
*  Touch, feel, you know, balance. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=191.2s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=194.4s)]
*  I need to talk to him about that because I just met him via text through a friend. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=195.4s)]
*  I had a guy on a podcast. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  He knows him. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=200.84s)]
*  And apparently he played football too. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=201.84s)]
*  His name is Scott Peters. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=204.04s)]
*  And he, you know, when he retired, he started doing MMA and started doing jiu jitsu and fell [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  in love with it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=211.28s)]
*  Then he got a job as he's an assistant offensive line coach for the Browns. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=212.28s)]
*  And he's all about teaching them jiu jitsu. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  That's pretty badass. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=218.72s)]
*  Well, I'd imagine those guys are all bad asses. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=219.72s)]
*  They want to learn jiu jitsu. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=222.48s)]
*  Who doesn't want to learn jiu jitsu? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=223.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=224.72s)]
*  Who's going, nah, I don't want to learn that shit. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=225.72s)]
*  A lot of people actually. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=227.72s)]
*  They just don't want to get strangled. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=228.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=230.72s)]
*  They don't want to start out as beginners. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=231.72s)]
*  The same thing happened to the Browns though. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=232.72s)]
*  Second week, on paper, the Browns look like a playoff contender for sure on paper. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=234.4s)]
*  But everyone, you know, it's all about how you execute and how it all gels. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=241.2s)]
*  But the one constant that we have, we have the best running back in the game, Nick Chubb. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=246.32s)]
*  Best running, so he rarely ever gets hurt. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=250.04s)]
*  You know, we needed some wide receivers. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  We needed some defensive linemen. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  We got all new defensive linemen except for Miles Garrett and new defensive coordinator. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=255.92s)]
*  But we always knew Nick Chubb. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=261.96s)]
*  We got the best running back in the game, probably ever. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  His average is 5.4. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=266.32s)]
*  A carry that's huge. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=268.32s)]
*  That's like top three in NFL history. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=269.32s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=271.28s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=272.28s)]
*  Second week, Monday Night Football, his leg fucking breaks. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=273.56s)]
*  It was so gruesome. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  Is that the one when it broke at the knee? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=277.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=279.36s)]
*  Oh, I saw that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=280.36s)]
*  Oh. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=281.36s)]
*  They didn't show the replays. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  Oh, I saw it online. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  They showed it online. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  Oh my God, it was horrible. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  That was devastating. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  I got sad. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  Like it was like for two or three days, I was like, oh my God, I spent all this fucking [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  time and now we just lost our best player. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=293.48s)]
*  Fuck! [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=298.0s)]
*  But they came back the next week, which was yesterday, and dominated the Titans. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=299.72s)]
*  So they adjusted. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=303.88s)]

*  At any time. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=489.36s)]
*  I think about that all the time when I'm on the highway. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=490.36s)]
*  You know, when I come home from the mothership at nighttime in Texas, that's when all the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=492.8s)]
*  truck drivers are on the road. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=498.0s)]
*  And so when I come home, sometimes, like, we're the only car on the road. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=500.12s)]
*  It's like all trucks. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=505.52s)]
*  It's all semis. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=506.72s)]
*  And one time there was some sort of a traffic thing. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=508.64s)]
*  So the opposite side of the road, all the traffic was shut down and it was hundreds [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=512.04s)]
*  of semis, hundreds. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=518.16s)]
*  I'm like, I guess they just drive at night. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=521.04s)]
*  Like when there's going to be no traffic, that's when they can make the most time. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=523.92s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=527.12s)]
*  It makes sense. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=528.12s)]
*  But it's like one of those fucking dudes is not paying attention or their fucking Adderall [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=529.12s)]
*  runs out or whatever. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=533.76s)]
*  They fall asleep at the wheel and you're done, man. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=535.74s)]
*  You know a video I just saw was a couple, male and female, like off to the side of the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=538.0999999999999s)]
*  road on the freeway. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=544.6199999999999s)]
*  And they're like, I don't know, they broke down. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=545.9s)]
*  And this tire got loose and was coming and rolling down and fucking went right into the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=548.5s)]
*  chick. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=554.42s)]

*  Tires take people out, man. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=560.9399999999999s)]
*  They take people out. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=562.54s)]
*  Because they pop off sometimes. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=563.54s)]
*  People don't check their fucking lug nuts. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=565.6999999999999s)]
*  Do you see that one lady who was driving on the highway, she was on pills, and the cops [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=568.3399999999999s)]
*  pulled her over and she had no wheel? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=573.9399999999999s)]
*  Her right passenger side front wheel was gone and she's driving on the brake? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=576.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=581.9s)]
*  So she's got her rotors and it's just sparking. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=582.9s)]
*  She's just like this. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=584.3s)]
*  She doesn't even know anything's wrong. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=586.3s)]
*  And the cops pull her over and they're like, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=588.3s)]
*  It's like, what? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=590.62s)]

*  She's like, no, I'm not on pills. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=593.62s)]
*  Like she's clearly on pills. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=595.38s)]
*  And you got to think, like, how many people out meet, you know how many people are on [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=598.14s)]
*  Oxy's, right? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=600.34s)]

*  Meanwhile mushrooms aren't. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=611.82s)]
*  Yeah, they're trying to get, I keep seeing that they're still trying to get weed on off [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=612.82s)]
*  schedule one. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=618.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=619.14s)]
*  I mean, it seems like it's close, right? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=620.14s)]
*  You would think that they would just like just make that happen already because state [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=622.54s)]
*  after state after state is legalizing it, right? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=628.06s)]
*  What's the state of weed in Texas? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=630.3s)]
*  Texas, it's decriminalized in Austin. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=632.8199999999999s)]
*  It is illegal in Texas. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=636.6999999999999s)]
*  Bro, they arrested Willie Nelson. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=637.98s)]
*  That should be against the law. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=640.98s)]
*  And Tommy Chong. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=641.98s)]
*  Yeah, but Willie Nelson, Tommy Chong was a different one. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=642.98s)]
*  Tommy Chong was a bad one because what they, and I talked to Tommy after it happened, he [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=646.18s)]
*  did my podcast. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=651.8199999999999s)]
*  This was a long time ago. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=652.8199999999999s)]
*  They got him in Florida and all he was doing was selling bongs. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=653.8199999999999s)]
*  He was selling bongs. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=658.3s)]
*  But if you sell bongs in Florida, it was drug parnofinalia. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=659.3s)]
*  And so they threatened his family because it was a family business. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=664.62s)]
*  So Tommy's like, I'll go to jail. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=668.48s)]
*  So Tommy went to jail for them. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=670.5s)]
*  And then afterwards, I think they drug tested him for a long time. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=672.56s)]
*  I think part of the conditions of his parole was that they had to randomly drug test him [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=677.3s)]
*  so he couldn't smoke any weed for a long fucking time. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=682.66s)]
*  Now he's selling weed. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=687.18s)]
*  And how much time did he do? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=688.68s)]
*  Did he do time? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=689.68s)]
*  He went to jail, right? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=690.68s)]
*  He did time. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=692.38s)]
*  I think Tommy Chong, I want to say he did two years. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=693.38s)]
*  Damn. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=697.06s)]
*  Let's find out. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=698.06s)]
*  Find out how much time did Tommy Chong do. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=699.06s)]
*  Not even for weed, Eddie. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=700.98s)]
*  For fucking bongs. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=702.86s)]
*  That was just half baked. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=705.3s)]
*  For weed. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=706.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty wild that in 2023, it's still illegal. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=709.78s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=715.5799999999999s)]
*  It's pretty damn legal in California. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=716.88s)]
*  It should be. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=718.6999999999999s)]
*  It seems like you could just smoke weed anywhere. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=719.78s)]
*  Yeah, Vegas too. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=721.62s)]
*  That's what's wild. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=723.62s)]
*  Vegas? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=724.62s)]
*  Bro, there's people in jail for life in Vegas. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=725.62s)]
*  Still. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=728.66s)]
*  In the 1970s, if they caught you smoking weed, they put you in jail forever. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=729.66s)]
*  What does it say here? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=733.8199999999999s)]
*  Nine months. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=735.62s)]
*  Nine months in federal prison, a fine of $20,000, forfeiture of $103,514, and the loss of all [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=736.62s)]
*  merchandise seized during the raid on his business. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=743.74s)]
*  Scary. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=746.74s)]
*  Nine months for bongs. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=747.74s)]
*  And what year was that? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=751.98s)]
*  2004. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=752.98s)]
*  Three and four, yeah. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=753.98s)]
*  Damn. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=754.98s)]
*  20 years ago. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=755.98s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=756.98s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=757.98s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=758.98s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=759.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=760.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=761.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's not right. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=763.5s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=766.94s)]
*  And they got to know it now. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=768.58s)]
*  So it gets a slow trickle before things become legal. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=770.5s)]
*  But I thought the Biden administration was, that was a part of their thing that they ran [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=774.38s)]
*  on that they were going to decriminalize marijuana. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=778.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's one democratic issue that I'm with. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=781.46s)]
*  100%. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=786.38s)]
*  100%. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=787.38s)]
*  I'm with it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=788.38s)]
*  I'm with it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=789.38s)]
*  In other states, like I believe in Oregon, they've decriminalized mushrooms. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=790.38s)]
*  What have they done with Oregon with mushrooms? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=796.02s)]
*  I think Oregon might have decriminalized everything. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=798.42s)]
*  I think Oregon is a wild state. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=802.42s)]
*  I think they might have decriminalized literally everything. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=804.36s)]
*  I think they decriminalized steroids. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=806.78s)]
*  I think they decriminalized mushrooms. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=808.34s)]
*  I think they decriminalized fucking everything. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=809.98s)]
*  Do you know in Vancouver, you can buy, they have a place called the Drugs Store, and you [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=813.38s)]
*  can go in there and buy tested drugs. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=820.22s)]
*  So you can go in there and buy tested cocaine. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=823.5s)]
*  It's a brick and mortar store. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=826.34s)]
*  And this guy is apparently testing the boundaries of the law. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=829.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean, what the fuck? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=833.86s)]
*  I would think that's a trap. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=834.86s)]
*  If I was walking into that drug store, I was like, you got cocaine? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=835.86s)]
*  You have pure cocaine for sale? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=839.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=842.1s)]
*  Are you wearing a wire, bitch? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=843.1s)]
*  Like what the fuck is going on? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=844.86s)]
*  How are you, what are you doing? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=846.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to buy cocaine from you in a store? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=849.1s)]
*  Can I use my credit card? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=851.5799999999999s)]
*  I can? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=852.74s)]
*  Like, what is, see if you can find that, the Drugs Store. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=853.74s)]
*  I think it might have been shut down because the owner died from a suspected fentanyl overdose. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=857.9s)]
*  Ah, whoops. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=862.8199999999999s)]
*  It wasn't taking his own product. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=864.42s)]
*  It's a short shutdown 24 hours later. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=866.14s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=869.22s)]
*  Yeah, they might have killed him. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=870.22s)]
*  I bet like some rival drug dealers are like, hey man, fuck you. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=872.74s)]
*  If he died from fentanyl, I don't think the government would have poisoned him with fentanyl. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=876.98s)]
*  Yeah, the fentanyl thing is crazy. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=881.26s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=883.22s)]
*  How could anybody want to do coke knowing that shit's out there? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=884.22s)]
*  I think they have tests. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=889.86s)]
*  But if you're one of those dudes who's partying and you're doing coke, you're not going, hey, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=892.4200000000001s)]
*  you guys have a test? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=896.6600000000001s)]
*  This also isn't like a real store. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=898.1800000000001s)]
*  It's a pop-up shop. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=899.98s)]
*  Oh. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=901.3000000000001s)]
*  Like mobile, like almost a bus or something. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=902.0200000000001s)]
*  I thought it was at a brick and mortar store. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=905.54s)]
*  It says after parking his 24-foot camper on Main Street between Hastings and Cordova, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=907.54s)]
*  he made his first decision. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=912.18s)]
*  I think he was doing it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=913.18s)]
*  I mean, it does show people walking in and out of a building, but it might have just been vacant. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=914.18s)]
*  They just kind of walked in. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=917.38s)]
*  You know, it's crazy. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=918.38s)]
*  I was just in Japan, and you don't ever have to worry about any kind of crime in Japan. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=919.38s)]
*  Isn't it wild? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=925.38s)]
*  Japan's amazing. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=926.38s)]
*  There's no crime. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=927.38s)]
*  But you know, it is, that is definitely, and it's so clean. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=928.38s)]
*  They clean everything. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=932.38s)]
*  Everybody's super nice, you know, everybody, but you can't have a gun. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=933.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=938.38s)]
*  Yeah, they got everybody under control. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=939.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=942.38s)]
*  But I was there for Quintet, and Quintet is a team jujitsu tournament. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=943.38s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=950.38s)]
*  Sakuraba, the pride legend, that's his show. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=951.38s)]
*  But this time... [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=955.38s)]
*  Does he still grapple? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=956.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=957.38s)]
*  He's on the team. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=958.38s)]
*  He's got a team. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=959.38s)]
*  How's his knees? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=960.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=961.38s)]
*  He's got them up like mommies. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=962.38s)]
*  He doesn't really speak English, so we have a hard time... [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=963.38s)]
*  He's awesome. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=967.38s)]
*  I fucking love him. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=968.38s)]
*  We just do like jokey stuff whenever I see him, because he's like a clown. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=970.38s)]
*  Yeah, he's so funny. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=973.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=975.38s)]
*  But so Quintet decided to co-promote with K-1. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=976.38s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=980.38s)]
*  You didn't know this? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=981.38s)]
*  No. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=982.38s)]
*  Dude, you're a kickboxing fanatic, and you didn't know K-1 brought back the heavyweight [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=983.38s)]
*  absolute tournament? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=988.38s)]
*  I heard they were doing that, but I didn't know they did it. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=989.38s)]
*  They brought it back. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=993.38s)]
*  And guess who they wanted to commentate? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=994.38s)]
*  You? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=996.38s)]
*  I'm like, why would I commentate a kickbox? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=997.38s)]
*  That's like me commentating on football. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1000.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1002.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1003.38s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1004.38s)]
*  And they asked me, because they co-promoted, and it was like in this arena where they had [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1006.38s)]
*  two stages, the K-1 stage and the Quintet stage, and they kind of merged together. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1012.38s)]
*  And K-1 was during the day. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1016.38s)]
*  It started at noon. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1018.38s)]
*  And then after K-1 was done, then it all shifted over here on the side and to the Quintet side. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1019.38s)]
*  That started at like six or something. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1024.38s)]
*  But they wanted me, they asked me if I wanted to commentate the heavyweight tournament. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1027.38s)]
*  I'm like, I know nothing about. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1031.38s)]
*  The only thing I know about kickboxing is the old school K-1, like Peter Aerts. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1033.38s)]
*  I met him. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1037.38s)]
*  He was there. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1038.38s)]
*  Peter Aerts. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1039.38s)]
*  The Roller Banner. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1040.38s)]
*  Ernesto Hust. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1041.38s)]
*  Yeah, Ray Sifu and all those guys. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1042.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1043.38s)]
*  And Sammy Schilt. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1044.38s)]
*  The old school K-1, the classic ones where dudes were getting shut off left and right. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1045.38s)]
*  Left and right. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1049.38s)]
*  And this one was, because apparently they hadn't done the absolute heavyweight tournament [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1050.38s)]
*  that the eight man won in a while. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1056.38s)]
*  They've been sticking to K-1 max, like lightweights and middleweights, and they're some bad motherfuckers. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1058.38s)]
*  So I don't pay attention to kickboxing. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1063.38s)]
*  I wouldn't even know what K-1 max was. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1067.38s)]
*  I learned all the shit while I was there. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1069.38s)]
*  And so they had an eight man absolute tournament, all new guys. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1071.38s)]
*  And dude, there was this fucking six foot eight Chinese dude straight coming out with the CCP flag and everything, looking like Chinese Ivan Drago. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1077.38s)]
*  What does he look like? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1087.38s)]
*  I mean, what's his name? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1088.38s)]

*  Dude, his name is like Say Loo, something like that. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1093.38s)]
*  We'll find out. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1099.38s)]
*  Scary. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1100.38s)]

*  Wow. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1107.38s)]
*  He fucked everybody up. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1108.38s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1109.38s)]
*  Look at the size of that guy. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1110.38s)]
*  With leg kicks. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1111.38s)]
*  He got incredible footwork. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1112.38s)]
*  Look at the size of his fucking legs. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1114.38s)]
*  Look at his quads. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1116.38s)]
*  Dude, he claims, he claims wushu. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1117.38s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1120.38s)]
*  But it's kickboxing. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1121.38s)]
*  Of course. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1123.38s)]
*  He's doing kickboxing. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1124.38s)]
*  But that's a good move. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1125.38s)]
*  If you're from China, claim wushu. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1126.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1128.38s)]
*  And he didn't show up to the press conference. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1129.38s)]
*  It was a big mystery. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1131.38s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1133.38s)]
*  And there was a guy from Italy, this guy. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1134.38s)]
*  They call him the Grizzly Bear. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1136.38s)]
*  He ended up fighting him in the finals. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1138.38s)]
*  That guy, the Grizzly Bear, had like insane power. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1140.38s)]
*  Dude, he was fucking people up. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1144.38s)]

*  The Grizzly Bear's got the beard. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1148.38s)]
*  See if you can find a video of the actual fight, Jamie. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1149.38s)]
*  I love it. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1152.38s)]
*  You know, I put a post up on Instagram the other day after the rod tank fight on 1FC. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1153.38s)]
*  Because Matt Brown posted it, like, how is Muay Thai not the biggest sport in the world? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1158.38s)]
*  And you watch this insane fight they had on 1FC. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1163.38s)]
*  And I was like, I think that has the most untapped potential of all the combat sports. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1166.38s)]
*  Because obviously, boxing is huge. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1172.38s)]
*  MMA is huge. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1175.38s)]
*  How the fuck is Muay Thai not huge? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1176.38s)]

*  With MMA gloves, too. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1184.38s)]
*  With four ounce gloves. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1185.38s)]
*  Jamie, see if you could find that fight first. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1187.38s)]

*  It's all right. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1194.38s)]
*  It's on my Instagram. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1195.38s)]
*  It's like two, three posts ago. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1196.38s)]
*  And it's this war that these guys had in Thailand. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1202.38s)]
*  So they did a 1FC in Thailand. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1207.38s)]

*  And they're fighting with these little tiny MMA gloves on. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1234.38s)]
*  Which is a wild move that 1FC is doing. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1238.38s)]

*  I brought it up with Dana. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1288.38s)]
*  And I said, dude, I know you guys are into the slap fight thing. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1289.38s)]
*  But I think the thing that's untapped is kickboxing. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1292.38s)]
*  And he was like, ah, but nobody liked that, that PK karate. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1296.38s)]
*  I'm like, bro, that was in the 1980s. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1299.38s)]
*  That was literally, they used to call it the kick of the 80s. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1301.38s)]
*  Remember? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1304.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1305.38s)]
*  But bad Brad Heptan. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1306.38s)]
*  It just needs to be marketed different because there's always been kickboxing. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1307.38s)]
*  We've always had kickboxing. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1311.38s)]
*  We had glory. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1312.38s)]
*  We had K-1 forever. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1313.38s)]
*  But it didn't ever reach the heights that it was capable of reaching. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1314.38s)]
*  It could have with glory. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1318.38s)]
*  Glory was very, very high level. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1319.38s)]
*  And they tried it for a while. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1321.38s)]
*  How could they do it to take it to the next level? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1323.38s)]
*  The UFC machine. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1325.38s)]
*  Put the UFC machine behind it. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1326.38s)]
*  If they put the UFC promotion machine behind high level kickboxing and got just fucking, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1327.38s)]
*  hey, we're going to sign the biggest fighters in the world. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1333.38s)]
*  We're going to have UFC kickboxing. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1336.38s)]
*  So here's this gigantic Chinese guy. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1338.38s)]
*  This is the final against the Grizzly Bear. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1341.38s)]
*  Look at the size of that Grizz. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1343.38s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1344.38s)]
*  He's fucking his legs up. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1345.38s)]
*  And this guy is six foot eight. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1346.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1348.38s)]
*  Oh, he's good, man. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1349.38s)]
*  Oh, chopping those legs down. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1350.38s)]
*  I think he beat all three opponents with leg kicks. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1352.38s)]
*  They couldn't take it. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1354.38s)]
*  So they're trying to reboot it and start a whole new absolute K-1. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1355.38s)]
*  How do you say his name? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1361.38s)]
*  I forget. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1363.38s)]
*  L-I-U-C-E. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1364.38s)]
*  Luce. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1366.38s)]
*  Luce? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1367.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1368.38s)]
*  Luce. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1369.38s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1370.38s)]
*  But what really, dude, I was so entertained. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1371.38s)]
*  I was so into it. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1375.38s)]
*  And I didn't know any of these guys. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1376.38s)]
*  You know what did it for me was the tournament. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1377.38s)]
*  It's the tournament. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1381.38s)]
*  First round, I didn't know any of these guys. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1382.38s)]
*  That second round, though, I was like, I know these guys. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1383.38s)]
*  Shit, that guy's going to fight that guy. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1386.38s)]
*  And then the final, boom, like, oh, shit, Grizzly Bear. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1387.38s)]
*  I was so into it. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1390.38s)]
*  I was commentating with Michael Chevello. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1392.38s)]
*  That guy's insane. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1394.38s)]
*  I love him. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1395.38s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1396.38s)]
*  And when I say insane, I mean, he's insane good. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1397.38s)]
*  The big kabosh. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1399.38s)]
*  Dude, he's so good. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1400.38s)]
*  He is an encyclopedia of boxing. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1401.38s)]
*  Of Muay Thai. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1404.38s)]
*  And MMA. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1405.38s)]
*  He knows fucking everything. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1406.38s)]
*  He knows fucking everything. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1407.38s)]
*  He knows fucking everything. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1408.38s)]
*  Dude, I was so impressed with him. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1409.38s)]
*  He used to be the guy for 1FC. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1410.38s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1411.38s)]
*  It fell apart. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1412.38s)]
*  He left 1FC. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1413.38s)]
*  Sometimes things happen. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1414.38s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes things happen. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1415.38s)]
*  But he's a fucking man. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1416.38s)]
*  Yeah, he's so good, man. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1417.38s)]
*  And that tournament. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1418.38s)]
*  He's a good dude, too. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1419.38s)]
*  Man, it got me into it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1420.38s)]
*  Like, I watch the next one. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1421.38s)]
*  As long as it's in tournament form, that's the key, man. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1422.38s)]
*  That's what got everybody into the UFC is the tournaments. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1423.38s)]
*  The UFC should hire Michael Chevello and do a fucking, a Muay Thai tournament. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1424.38s)]
*  And then they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to be the guy for the tournament. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1425.38s)]
*  And then they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to be the guy for the tournament. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1426.38s)]
*  And then they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to be the guy for the tournament. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1427.38s)]
*  And then they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to be the guy for the tournament. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1428.38s)]
*  And then they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to be the guy for the tournament. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1429.38s)]
*  And then they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to be the guy for the tournament. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1430.38s)]
*  And then they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to be the guy for the tournament. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1431.38s)]
*  And then they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to be the guy for the tournament. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1432.38s)]
*  And then they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to be the guy for the tournament. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1433.38s)]
*  And then they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to be the guy for the tournament. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1434.38s)]
*  And then they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to be the guy for the tournament. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1435.38s)]
*  I'm going to hire Michael Shavello and do a fucking a Muay Thai card. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1436.38s)]
*  Dana, I'll commentate. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1441.38s)]
*  You heard me. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1443.38s)]
*  I'll fucking commentate it. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1444.38s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1445.38s)]
*  Is Dana a fan of kickboxing though? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1446.38s)]
*  Does he follow it? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1448.38s)]
*  Dana's a fan of whatever works. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1449.38s)]
*  He's a fan of fights. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1451.38s)]
*  He just thinks that for whatever reason, that kickboxing never caught on in America. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1452.38s)]
*  And I think it's because of that PKA karate shit they have in the 1980s. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1456.38s)]
*  But dudes were wearing fucking long pants. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1461.38s)]
*  They couldn't kick the legs. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1463.38s)]
*  It's a different sport, man. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1464.38s)]
*  And there were some great fighters that came out of that, guys like Rick Rufus. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1465.38s)]
*  But it's just a different sport. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1468.38s)]
*  If you look at the fights on 1FC and you look at the fights and the classic K-1 fights, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1471.38s)]
*  my God, how is that not exciting? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1477.38s)]
*  It's so exciting. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1479.38s)]
*  And if they have a fight with the little gloves on like K-1 does or like 1FC does, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1480.38s)]
*  if Dana decided to get behind that, God, it would be huge. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1487.38s)]
*  Muay Thai. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1491.38s)]
*  UFC Muay Thai. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1492.38s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1494.38s)]
*  Dana, I'll commentate. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1497.38s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1499.38s)]
*  I'll promote it. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1500.38s)]
*  Do you think tournaments are still possible? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1501.38s)]
*  I mean, tournaments, because tournaments aren't possible at MMA because they say it's too brutal. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1504.38s)]
*  But kickboxing is way more brutal. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1508.38s)]
*  Well, you remember when we went to see Joe Schilling fight in LA? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1510.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1513.38s)]
*  Last Man Standing, that glory fight. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1514.38s)]
*  I think Joe fought three times that night, which is crazy for a kickboxing fight. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1515.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1521.38s)]
*  He fought Artem Levin. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1522.38s)]
*  Who else did he fight? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1523.38s)]
*  He fought, God, I don't remember who he fought. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1524.38s)]
*  I don't remember everybody he fought that night. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1525.38s)]
*  But God damn, that was a war. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1526.38s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1527.38s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1528.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1529.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1530.38s)]
*  I remember meeting Gene Simmons there. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1531.38s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1532.38s)]
*  And the first time I met him, I embarrassed myself. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1533.38s)]
*  You told the story. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1534.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1535.38s)]
*  So I was like, I'm going to be cool this time. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1536.38s)]
*  He probably didn't remember. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1537.38s)]

*  I remember, luckily, that guy's met a billion people. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1551.38s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1553.8200000000002s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1554.8200000000002s)]
*  You want a little cigar? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1555.8200000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1556.8200000000002s)]
*  Ron White gives me these. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1557.8200000000002s)]
*  They're little baby cigars. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1558.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm not a big cigar guy, but let's ... [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1560.8200000000002s)]
*  They're basically like a cigarette. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1562.8200000000002s)]
*  It's just like pure tobacco. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1564.8200000000002s)]
*  No, you just pop on it. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1566.8200000000002s)]
*  Just take a little puff. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1569.96s)]
*  What do you think of ... [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1572.72s)]
*  What do you think of a bare knuckle? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1573.72s)]
*  I love it. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1576.5s)]
*  I love what Jorge Masvidal's doing. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1577.5s)]
*  Bare knuckle MMA fights? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1579.98s)]
*  I love it. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1581.98s)]
*  Because that's what I think MMA should have been all along. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1582.98s)]
*  Why can you have bare elbows? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1586.38s)]
*  Why can you have bare knees, bare shins? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1589.34s)]
*  A shin to the face is okay, but you have to protect your knuckles. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1592.14s)]
*  The only thing that does is prevent cuts. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1596.22s)]
*  One thing it also does is protect your hands, because you can't really go off like you can [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1599.98s)]
*  with bare ... [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1605.58s)]
*  Bare knuckle guys are more ... [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1606.6599999999999s)]
*  They're more cautious about where they hit. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1608.78s)]
*  They're more precise. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1611.3799999999999s)]
*  They have to be more precise. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1612.3799999999999s)]
*  They break their hands. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1613.9399999999998s)]
*  I think on paper, bare knuckle is way better than traditional boxing. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1614.9399999999998s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1620.3s)]
*  If you did a poll and you asked, what would you rather watch? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1622.22s)]
*  Floyd Mayweather versus Pacquiao 4 or whatever it is, bare knuckle or regular boxing? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1629.1799999999998s)]
*  I bet most people would say bare knuckle. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1634.86s)]
*  Well, a lot of people that go over to bare knuckle are surprised at how little protection [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1636.5s)]
*  you have and how much it hurts. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1642.3s)]
*  That's where Mike Perry fucking shines. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1644.9399999999998s)]
*  How's he doing right now? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1647.8999999999999s)]
*  Killing it. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1648.8999999999999s)]
*  He's killing it? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1649.8999999999999s)]
*  Killing it. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1650.8999999999999s)]
*  Fucked up Luke Rockhold in his last fight, made him quit, knocked his teeth out. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1651.8999999999999s)]
*  Luke's like, enough. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1654.58s)]
*  He's fucking everybody up because he's such an animal. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1656.62s)]
*  If you're tough, and there's not a tougher human being alive than Mike Perry, he's like [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1659.54s)]
*  uniquely suited for bare knuckle fighting because he's just such a fucking savage. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1664.74s)]
*  He's willing to kill or be killed, like legitimately. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1669.9399999999998s)]
*  No fear. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1672.6999999999998s)]
*  He goes in there, kill or be killed, and he's good, man. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1673.74s)]
*  He knows how to fight bare knuckle. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1676.34s)]
*  He's clever. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1677.78s)]
*  Who do you think that's currently in the UFC is probably going to end up doing great in [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1678.78s)]
*  bare knuckle? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1685.3799999999999s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1686.3799999999999s)]
*  Chris Camozzi just fought. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1688.18s)]
*  He just fought that dude, the juggernaut, who's the, I believe the middleweight champion [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1690.38s)]
*  in bare knuckle UFC, and the juggernaut beat him. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1694.3000000000002s)]
*  The thing about it is, man, it's different. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1701.1000000000001s)]
*  It's just different. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1703.7800000000002s)]
*  When you're just getting knuckles in your eyeballs and knuckles in your face, it fucking [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1704.7800000000002s)]
*  hurts more. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1708.3400000000001s)]
*  It's more dangerous. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1709.66s)]
*  Yeah, it cuts you up way more. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1710.66s)]
*  You're losing teeth. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1712.3000000000002s)]
*  You get hit with a knuckle right here. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1713.3000000000002s)]
*  That tooth's gone, son. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1714.5800000000002s)]
*  What's going with the highest level mouth guards? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1716.1s)]
*  It helps a little, but really you'd probably need a crazy thick mouth guard. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1718.18s)]
*  You'd probably need something different. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1721.62s)]
*  But even then, it's knuckles. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1723.26s)]
*  You're getting that bone of a bony ass knuckle, and it's going right here. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1725.46s)]
*  It's going to fuck your teeth up, man. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1730.7s)]
*  Now, K-1, they don't allow you to do the plum clench and hold their head and throw multiple [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1732.3799999999999s)]
*  knees. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1738.42s)]
*  You could only hold it real quick. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1739.42s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1740.42s)]
*  I don't think that's the way to go. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1741.42s)]
*  I think elbows. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1743.06s)]
*  One, they allow them to hold the clench longer? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1744.82s)]
*  Yeah, one is Muay Thai. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1747.02s)]
*  That fight, that was Muay Thai. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1749.1799999999998s)]
*  They can clench, they can elbow. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1750.4199999999998s)]
*  I want them to be able to use everything. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1752.22s)]
*  All the tools, all the weapons. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1754.46s)]
*  And let them do it with those little gloves, too. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1756.7s)]
*  Because the big gloves, the thing about the big gloves is you can offer a shield. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1759.74s)]
*  If you ever watch Badr Hari fight, he fights like this. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1763.1s)]
*  So it's a shield. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1766.62s)]
*  You have this big 10-ounce glove. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1767.62s)]
*  It covers, it's cushioned, and you're fighting like this. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1769.46s)]
*  And Alistair, when Alistair was fighting in K-1, they all fought like this. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1773.46s)]
*  But you can't do that with those little gloves, because the little gloves sneak around. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1776.78s)]
*  And you can't do that even more so with Bare Knuckle, because Bare Knuckle really sneaks [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1780.7s)]
*  around. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1785.3799999999999s)]
*  There's no protection. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1786.3799999999999s)]
*  It'll just slide off the fist right into your face. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1787.3799999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1789.42s)]
*  And Mike Perry has developed a style where he holds his hands real rigid like this. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1790.42s)]
*  It's different. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1795.42s)]
*  He's adapted to Bare Knuckle, and he also has had several fights. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1797.66s)]
*  So he knows what to expect. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1802.14s)]
*  So if you're Luke Rockhold, and you're fighting Mike Perry, this is your first Bare Knuckle [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1803.74s)]
*  fight, you never fought Bare Knuckle, because you certainly aren't fucking training Bare [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1807.7s)]
*  Knuckle. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1810.98s)]
*  Like, you can train MMA with MMA gloves on, right? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1811.98s)]
*  You can't really train Bare Knuckle, right? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1815.38s)]
*  You got to wear gloves. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1818.42s)]
*  So that first experience of getting a knuckle in your eyeball and a knuckle on your nose [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1819.42s)]
*  where your nose gets just fucking splattered all over your face, it's a different experience. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1823.38s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1828.0200000000002s)]
*  There's so many different sports now, fighting sports. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1829.22s)]
*  There's so many. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1835.58s)]
*  There's Bare Knuckle, regular boxing, even regular collegiate wrestling is getting bigger. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1836.58s)]
*  That's getting bigger. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1843.46s)]
*  People are starting to watch. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1844.46s)]
*  I'm watching. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1845.46s)]
*  I never really watched wrestling, but now I'm watching. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1846.46s)]
*  I didn't realize, and I wrestled a couple years, and I didn't realize how fucking, how [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1848.78s)]
*  much it evolved. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1855.78s)]
*  There's so much shit in wrestling, dude. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1856.78s)]
*  There's so much shit. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1859.78s)]
*  It's like everything else. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1861.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=1862.3s)]

*  He was so nice. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2185.3399999999997s)]
*  Super nice guy. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2187.8599999999997s)]
*  And they twisted his arm and he was going to do a UFC and then he backed out. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2189.2999999999997s)]
*  He said, dude, it's just too frightening. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2193.7s)]
*  So then he got offered to do an eight-man tournament in Brazil in the middle of nowhere [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2195.7799999999997s)]
*  before the internet or anything. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2200.62s)]
*  So he said, you know what? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2202.82s)]
*  I'm going to go try this thing in Brazil. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2203.82s)]
*  And if I get fucked up, nobody's going to know about it and I'll just dip out. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2206.06s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2210.02s)]
*  And so he went down there and fucking destroyed. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2211.2200000000003s)]
*  He ended up in the finals. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2215.7000000000003s)]
*  It was bare knuckle, bare knuckle, Valle Tudo, MMA, old school, in a ring, no cage. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2216.94s)]
*  And in the finals, he fought Fabio Jurgel. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2224.38s)]
*  Was it Fabio Jurgel? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2228.5s)]
*  It was Fabio Jurgel. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2231.1000000000004s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it was him. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2233.14s)]
*  And dude, he was just in his guard the whole time. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2235.22s)]
*  Never tried to pass. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2237.98s)]
*  He was just in his guard in the corner and just headbutting and throwing fucking bare [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2238.98s)]
*  knuckles and he won. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2243.5s)]
*  And the Brazilians just thought he was a monster. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2246.42s)]
*  They called him like the smashing machine in Portuguese, which is like máquina destroyer [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2248.2999999999997s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2254.58s)]
*  I don't know what it was. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2255.58s)]
*  Anyways, so he said, he goes, after the fight, my hands are all caught up. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2257.74s)]
*  They're all fucked up. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2262.66s)]
*  They got infected. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2264.02s)]
*  I went to the, I was in the, he said he was in the hospital. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2265.02s)]
*  He got those. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2267.62s)]
*  Yeah, you get teeth in your hands. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2268.62s)]
*  Yeah, he got all fucked up. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2270.22s)]
*  He was in the hospital with like some kind of fucking sickness and shit. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2271.54s)]
*  And then the promoter taxed him way more than he thought. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2275.54s)]
*  He was like, I'll never do this again. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2280.54s)]
*  This was the worst fucking experience of my life. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2282.06s)]
*  Even though he won. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2284.94s)]
*  It was the worst experience of his life. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2286.98s)]
*  He don't ever want to do it. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2289.5s)]
*  It was, he was in the hospital. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2290.5s)]
*  They fucked him on cash and all that shit. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2291.94s)]
*  But then when he got back and on the internet was just, you'd have like little fucking news [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2294.06s)]
*  pages and he would then he saw the magazine of, of him and the cover of a magazine. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2298.02s)]
*  He's looking like a destroyer. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2302.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2304.22s)]
*  Brazilian magazine. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2305.22s)]
*  And then that's what's it. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2306.22s)]
*  That's what got him to jump in a hundred percent. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2307.58s)]
*  Do you remember when he tapped Dan Bobish with a chin to the eye socket? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2310.38s)]
*  That was at the UFC? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2315.1400000000003s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2316.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2317.42s)]
*  He got a hold of him. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2318.42s)]
*  He got inside control. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2319.42s)]
*  We played it the other day. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2320.42s)]
*  He stuck his chin and Dan, you know, he had that big ass chin. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2321.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2323.54s)]
*  He stuck his chin and Dan Bobish's eye socket and just fucking yanked his back of his head [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2324.54s)]
*  into his fucking eye socket. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2328.58s)]
*  He tapped him with that. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2330.38s)]
*  I'm like, how come no one's done that since? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2332.1800000000003s)]
*  That's a pretty wild move. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2333.98s)]
*  And I was telling him, I, and this is what I tell all high level wrestlers, even like [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2336.1400000000003s)]
*  low level wrestlers. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2341.86s)]
*  If you're a wrestler, you need to approach grappling not, not in the sense where you [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2343.38s)]
*  want to beat jujitsu. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2350.2200000000003s)]
*  Like these guys can't take me down. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2351.6200000000003s)]
*  You know, jujitsu guys can't take me down. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2353.98s)]
*  I'll box them. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2355.54s)]
*  They can't box. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2356.54s)]
*  I'm like, okay, okay. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2357.54s)]
*  But what about the guys that can box like kickboxers? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2358.54s)]
*  You're going to have to take them down, right? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2360.6600000000003s)]
*  Like when you fight a kickboxer, you're going to take him down. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2362.42s)]
*  You're going to have to learn how to pass the guard and get, and I would tell him, I [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2365.02s)]
*  really good at passing the guard, holding side control, submissions from side control, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2368.54s)]
*  mound, can have a death mound. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2373.8599999999997s)]
*  You need a death mound, arm bars, rear naked chokes. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2375.5s)]
*  Just you got to get good at passing the guard, Mark. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2379.2599999999998s)]
*  And he said, dude, it just takes too much energy, man. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2381.8999999999996s)]
*  It takes too, I'd rather just sit in the garden and just fucking pound. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2384.98s)]
*  I'm like, there's going to be guys that are going to tie you up and you're not going to [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2388.1s)]
*  be able to ground and you can't ground and pound everybody. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2390.8599999999997s)]
*  Some people you can, but some guys have a good defensive guard. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2393.62s)]
*  And a lot of wrestlers would say that too. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2398.14s)]
*  It wasn't just Mark Kerr. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2399.42s)]
*  They didn't want to pass the guard. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2400.42s)]
*  They wanted to beat Jiu-Jitsu. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2401.66s)]
*  I'll just stay in the garden. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2402.66s)]
*  Sir Coleman always did. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2404.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2405.14s)]
*  He headbutted dudes, punched them in the head in the guard. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2406.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2408.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2409.58s)]
*  So, and then he fights Igor Vovchanchin. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2410.58s)]
*  He takes Igor Vovchanchin a couple of times, two, three, maybe four times during that fight, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2413.86s)]
*  but he can't pass his guard. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2419.7400000000002s)]
*  And Igor Vovchanchin has a great chin. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2421.7s)]
*  He's a kickboxer. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2423.54s)]
*  So little ground and pound strikes aren't going to affect him that much. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2424.54s)]
*  He's not going to freak out. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2427.82s)]
*  And he had a really good close guard and he would hold and he would tie up and then they [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2428.82s)]
*  would stand him up. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2432.42s)]
*  And now we got to take him down again. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2433.7799999999997s)]
*  This is in Brazil. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2435.82s)]
*  This is Mark Kerr in Brazil right there. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2436.82s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2439.7799999999997s)]
*  This is the final. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2440.7799999999997s)]
*  Is that Fabio Jurgel, who was Marcelo Garcia's instructor? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2443.7s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2448.18s)]
*  I'll show you. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2449.18s)]
*  Just stay like this for the whole time. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2450.18s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2454.8599999999997s)]
*  That's the back when Pedro Hizot. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2456.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's Fabio. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2458.14s)]
*  That's when Pedro Hizot was fighting too. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2460.2999999999997s)]
*  And remember the Pedro too? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2462.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2464.2999999999997s)]
*  Do you remember when Gary Goodrich reached into the Pedro shorts and grabbed his balls [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2465.2999999999997s)]
*  and crushed him? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2469.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2470.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2471.7799999999997s)]
*  You can grab balls. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2472.7799999999997s)]
*  Can you find Igor Vovchanchin, Mark Kerr from Pride? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2473.7799999999997s)]
*  And you'll see that he was able to take down Igor Vovchanchin relatively easy, but he couldn't [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2476.5s)]
*  pass his guard and he couldn't finish him. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2483.38s)]
*  And he had to stand up with him. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2485.14s)]
*  And then eventually after a couple stand ups, he was tired and he couldn't take him down [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2486.14s)]
*  no more. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2490.46s)]
*  And then, you know, strikers light up, they smell blood, you know what I mean? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2491.46s)]
*  And then he, I think it was TKO. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2494.82s)]
*  I'm not too sure what kind of strike it was that ended the fight, but it was a flurry. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2497.26s)]
*  And that right there just shows like, man, all the best grapplers, not all of them, but [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2504.34s)]
*  a large percentage of the best jiu-jitsu guys in the US are wrestlers that fell in love [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2509.94s)]
*  with jiu-jitsu and got really good at guard passing, taking backs, mounting. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2516.7000000000003s)]
*  Igor had fucking hammers for a fist. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2523.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, there was no way he wanted to stand with Igor. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2525.42s)]
*  No. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2527.94s)]
*  He did throw down a little bit. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2528.94s)]
*  With that little short right hand. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2533.06s)]
*  And then boom, he knocks him down here. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2539.66s)]
*  Damn. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2541.46s)]
*  Yeah, I remember he hit him with like a big overhand right and knocked him down. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2542.46s)]
*  He keeps taking him down, but he can't finish him. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2547.18s)]
*  He can't, he's not even. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2550.58s)]
*  Right, Igor's just tying him up. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2551.58s)]
*  Yeah, he's not attempting to pass his guard. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2552.58s)]
*  He basically didn't like passing guard. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2554.76s)]
*  He didn't want to develop any guard passing skills. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2556.54s)]
*  He liked just staying in guard and throwing down. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2559.3s)]
*  But look at how Igor just wraps him up. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2561.18s)]
*  And not only does he have a good guard and he's wrapping him up, but like I said, he's [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2563.86s)]
*  a kickboxer. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2567.78s)]
*  He's used to taking punishment. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2568.78s)]
*  Like if he had like a wrestler like this or a jiu-jitsu guy, they're not, I mean he did [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2570.5s)]
*  cut him up, but they're not gonna. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2575.06s)]
*  But he's also tired. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2577.54s)]
*  This was also, this was during the smashing machine. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2579.1s)]
*  And so this was when Mark was already going through his addictions too, man. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2582.7400000000002s)]
*  Damn, battle right here. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2587.78s)]
*  Big right hand. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2590.06s)]
*  Big right hand. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2591.06s)]
*  This is such a brutal fight. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2592.06s)]
*  Look at his traps, dude. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2595.06s)]
*  It was so huge. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2598.06s)]
*  I talked to Ensign about fighting Igor and he said it was like getting hit by a car. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2600.1s)]
*  He goes like, he's like getting hit by a car over and over and over again. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2604.66s)]
*  He goes, it was just boom, boom. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2609.06s)]
*  This was back in the 10 minute round days, which I loved. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2613.62s)]
*  I loved the 10 minute first round. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2617.38s)]
*  I think the 10 minute first round was a genius idea because how many guys like, you know, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2619.7s)]
*  they just fucking, look at Mark trying some sort of an ankle lock. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2624.98s)]
*  Dude, that's under, he almost had an Aoki right there. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2627.7799999999997s)]
*  But it's like how many guys would take a guy down at four minutes and 20 seconds and then [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2631.5s)]
*  the round was over. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2637.5s)]
*  Can we see how it ended? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2638.5s)]
*  The last flurry. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2640.5s)]
*  So so many guys would, in the UFC, you'd take a guy down in the first round and you [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2642.92s)]
*  have no time to work and you work so hard to get him to the ground and then the next [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2652.2000000000003s)]
*  round starts and you're standing up. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2655.52s)]
*  Yep. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2656.96s)]
*  That happens a lot too. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2657.96s)]
*  What do you think about the idea of having, oh, he hit him with the knee to the head on [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2658.96s)]
*  the ground. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2665.08s)]
*  Look at that knee, look at the sprawl on that knee. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2666.08s)]
*  Boom. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2667.88s)]
*  That's a serious fucking knee right there. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2668.88s)]
*  What do you think about the idea of starting every round in the same position where you [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2671.56s)]
*  ended the last round? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2677.52s)]
*  I'm not opposed to that. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2678.84s)]
*  I'm not opposed to that at all. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2679.92s)]
*  Like I feel like you should earn your ability to stand up. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2681.48s)]
*  That was it. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2683.9s)]
*  Oh, that was it right there. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2684.9s)]
*  Can you rewind that one real quick? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2685.9s)]
*  Let's see the final shots. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2686.9s)]
*  His knees to the ground, knees on the ground. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2687.9s)]
*  That's another thing that I believe in. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2690.08s)]
*  I don't think you should be able to turtle. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2692.32s)]
*  I don't think you should be able to turtle and not get knee'd in the head because that's [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2693.88s)]
*  a legitimate technique. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2697.88s)]
*  If you can knee a guy standing up, why can't you knee a guy to the head on the ground? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2699.32s)]
*  Totally. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2702.84s)]
*  Especially if he's in the turtle. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2703.84s)]
*  If he's just hanging on to something, you're hanging on to one knee, you've got a knee [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2704.84s)]
*  free and his head's right there, but that guy can take you down and beat the fuck out [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2707.88s)]
*  of you. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2712.1200000000003s)]
*  Why can't you knee him in the head? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2713.1200000000003s)]
*  Can you do that in game bread? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2714.1200000000003s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2715.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2716.1200000000003s)]
*  I think it's unified rules. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2717.1200000000003s)]
*  It's just bare knuckle. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2718.6000000000004s)]
*  That's not unified rules though. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2720.6400000000003s)]
*  That sounds like they would just... [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2721.98s)]
*  Bare knuckle. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2722.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2723.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's like... [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2724.98s)]
*  It seems like there is a controversy of some kind after because he was complaining in the [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2725.98s)]
*  hallway and then they're showing some... [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2728.48s)]
*  I don't know what they're saying in the video obviously, but... [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2731.48s)]
*  Yeah, he got hit in the back of the head or something. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2733.48s)]
*  The top of the head? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2736.48s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2737.48s)]
*  Is that not legal? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2738.48s)]
*  Did they have like... [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2739.48s)]
*  What is the controversy? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2740.48s)]
*  I had a hearing about it, it looks like. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2741.48s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2742.48s)]
*  I could go close caption and read it, but this is other parts of the thing I think. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2743.48s)]
*  And then how about Mark Coleman in the heavyweight Grand Prix? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2749.2s)]
*  I think he fought Igor Vovchanchin in the final. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2755.68s)]
*  Did he? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2758.64s)]
*  And I think he... [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2759.64s)]
*  He fucked him up with knees. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2760.64s)]
*  From north-south. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2762.8799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2763.8799999999997s)]
*  I think Mark Coleman, Igor Vovchanchin, that was in the finals of the Grand Prix. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2764.8799999999997s)]
*  Now I remember. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2769.72s)]
*  He won the Grand Prix, right? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2770.72s)]
*  Mark Coleman did. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2771.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2772.72s)]
*  He was a champ. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2773.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2774.72s)]
*  I think the knees to the ground, it's a no-brainer. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2775.72s)]
*  That's a no-brainer. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2778.08s)]
*  If you can knee a guy standing up, if you can punch a guy in the face and kick a guy [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2779.08s)]
*  in the face, why can't you knee to the head? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2782.72s)]
*  You can knee to the body, but you can't knee to the head? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2785.08s)]
*  It would end so many more fights. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2788.12s)]
*  So many more fights. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2790.5s)]
*  How many times have a guy sprawls and the guy's in a turtle and it's a perfect position [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2791.5s)]
*  to throw the knee to the head, but you can't do it? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2795.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2798.88s)]
*  I think that should be legal. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2800.2s)]
*  You know what they're going to bring back? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2801.8s)]
*  12 to 6 elbows. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2802.8s)]
*  From where? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2804.84s)]
*  From standing in the guard, anywhere. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2805.84s)]
*  12 to 6 elbows is illegal still, which is the dumbest thing in the world. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2807.4s)]
*  Are illegal. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2812.2799999999997s)]
*  Did I say legal? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2813.2799999999997s)]
*  Illegal. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2814.52s)]
*  In the mount. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2815.52s)]
*  If I'm mounted, you can't go like this. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2816.52s)]
*  You can't go 12 to 6, which doesn't make any sense. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2818.2000000000003s)]
*  But from full guard, you can. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2820.2400000000002s)]
*  If I was on my back in full guard, you can. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2821.6400000000003s)]
*  Because it's going 6 to 12, which is the dumbest shit of all time. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2823.8s)]
*  But standing, you can't do it. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2827.8s)]
*  So if you and I are standing and you rush at me and do that and hit me with a 12 to [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2830.0s)]
*  6 elbow, that's illegal. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2835.0400000000004s)]
*  And they're going to change that? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2836.0400000000004s)]
*  They're going to change that. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2837.0400000000004s)]
*  Who's behind that? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2838.0400000000004s)]
*  Nowitzki talked to me about it. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2839.0400000000004s)]
*  He said, I know that this is something that you complain about all the time. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2841.72s)]
*  We think we're going to be able to get rid of that. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2844.36s)]
*  I'm like, oh, thank God. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2846.36s)]
*  It's the dumbest one. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2847.68s)]
*  Because it's not even a more powerful elbow. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2849.12s)]
*  It's just they saw it all came from Big John McCarthy told me this. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2851.84s)]
*  That in the early days of MMA, they would bring this to the athletic commissions. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2855.84s)]
*  And they said, you can't do this because we've seen those karate tournaments where the guys [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2859.56s)]
*  break bricks like that. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2863.96s)]
*  And ice. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2865.28s)]
*  And ice. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2866.28s)]
*  They're like, you can't break bricks. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2867.28s)]
*  You could kill somebody if you do that. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2869.16s)]
*  No elbow like that. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2871.4399999999996s)]
*  Elbow has to come at an angle. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2873.08s)]
*  So it can come from 12 to 6, but it can go 1 to 7, which is the dumbest shit of all [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2875.04s)]
*  time. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2882.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, the hardest elbow is not that. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2883.6s)]
*  The hardest elbow is this one. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2885.3599999999997s)]
*  This is the hardest elbow, in my opinion, I believe. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2887.7599999999998s)]
*  As far as I can throw it. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2891.64s)]
*  Because you're throwing it like a punch. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2893.48s)]
*  And I'm getting my weight into it. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2896.3599999999997s)]
*  If I'm in a ground and pound position, like I've done ground and pound work when you get [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2897.86s)]
*  a heavy weight down, a heavy bag down rather, and I'm trying to see what I can hit the hardest [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2902.26s)]
*  with. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2906.6200000000003s)]
*  You can hit hard like that, but I can hit really hard like that. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2907.6200000000003s)]
*  Boom! [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2911.5s)]
*  You can just gen. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2912.7400000000002s)]
*  It's so much more torque. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2913.7400000000002s)]
*  You got all this snap. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2915.1200000000003s)]
*  And it's also a natural movement where your body has developed that sort of explosiveness [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2916.9s)]
*  doing that. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2923.3s)]
*  It does it all the time. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2924.3s)]
*  This is unnatural, I think. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2925.3s)]
*  You could develop it. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2927.3s)]
*  But it's just a better option to have. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2928.98s)]
*  You want to be able to have that option to throw that. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2932.46s)]
*  If guys are doing this and you can go straight down the middle with an elbow, fucking you [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2935.2200000000003s)]
*  should be able to do it. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2938.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2940.38s)]
*  I mean, I like what Shotry is doing with one. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2941.38s)]
*  Allowing, you know, knees on the ground. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2945.86s)]
*  Allow that. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2949.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2950.82s)]
*  They allow soccer kicks. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2951.82s)]
*  I think there was, I'm not sure. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2953.0600000000004s)]
*  I think maybe they, like you can't stomp on their head anymore. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2955.2599999999998s)]
*  I think like, I think like if you have, if you're in a cage and the back of your head [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2961.4599999999996s)]
*  is. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2966.8599999999997s)]
*  This is from 2021 when they made rules. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2967.8599999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2970.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2971.5s)]
*  Grounded. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2972.5s)]
*  Athletes are considered grounded where they have any weight bearing part of their body [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2973.5s)]
*  other than the sole. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2976.8199999999997s)]
*  What is this from? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2977.8599999999997s)]
*  What rules? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2978.8599999999997s)]
*  This is from Colorado approving the rules for the championship. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2979.8599999999997s)]
*  Colorado. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2982.8599999999997s)]
*  For one. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2983.8599999999997s)]
*  This is for Colorado though. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2985.5s)]
*  All hand strikes, including punches, forearms and elbows to the head, body and all elbows. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2986.78s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2992.26s)]
*  So that means Colorado said 12 to six elbows legal? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2993.26s)]
*  So that's where I got this from. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2996.6600000000003s)]
*  There was an article from this year that said when they were doing the data review for finding [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=2998.02s)]
*  out if they were going to allow knees to the head of a grounded opponent, the 12 to six [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3001.9s)]
*  elbow data was in there. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3005.34s)]
*  Look, it says kneeing to the head of a grounded opponent is legal. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3006.6600000000003s)]
*  This is Colorado? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3010.1800000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3011.6600000000003s)]
*  Why can't the UFC do that? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3013.46s)]
*  Go back to that please. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3015.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3016.7s)]
*  I want to see what else it says. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3017.7s)]
*  Up kicks to the body and legs to a grounded opponent are legal. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3021.8199999999997s)]
*  Huh? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3026.5s)]
*  How could you? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3027.5s)]
*  You can't up kick to the head. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3028.5s)]
*  Up kick the head, body and legs of a non grounded opponent are legal. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3029.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3034.06s)]
*  So you can't, you still can't up kick to a grounded opponent, which means. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3035.06s)]
*  But that second to the last one, it says up kicks to the body and legs to a ground. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3039.02s)]
*  How are you going to up kick a grounded opponent? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3043.66s)]
*  To the body and the head. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3045.66s)]
*  But up kicks to the body and legs to a grounded opponent are legal. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3047.66s)]
*  How do you up kick a grounded opponent? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3053.2599999999998s)]
*  If you're on your back and the guy's on top of you and he's got his knees on the ground, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3055.06s)]
*  he's grounded, you can up kick him in the chest. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3059.42s)]
*  You can up kick him in the chest, so the body and the legs. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3062.1s)]
*  But up kicks to the head, body and legs of a non grounded opponent are legal. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3064.84s)]
*  If they're standing. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3069.1200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3070.1200000000003s)]
*  So if they're standing. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3071.1200000000003s)]
*  So if he's not grounded, he's standing, you can up kick him in the face. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3072.1200000000003s)]
*  I feel like you should be able to up kick a guy to the face if he's on the ground too. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3073.96s)]
*  Remember that up kick, Oleg Taktarov. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3077.96s)]
*  Enzo Gracie. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3080.96s)]

*  Whoa. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3083.96s)]
*  That one, that was probably the first one. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3084.96s)]
*  Probably. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3087.48s)]
*  That we saw. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3088.48s)]
*  Probably, yeah. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3089.48s)]
*  In a big fight. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3090.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3091.48s)]
*  And there was people thinking like, oh, lucky, lucky kick. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3092.48s)]
*  But then Enzo was saying, no, dude, we practice this shit dog. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3095.3199999999997s)]
*  We practice this. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3097.64s)]
*  And then you saw, was it Fabio Giorgio up kick Jerry Bolander? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3098.86s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3105.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3106.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3107.5s)]
*  Bro, guys who are really good kickers, if you get them on their back, they can fuck [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3108.5s)]
*  you up off their back. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3112.94s)]
*  This is weird. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3114.42s)]
*  Pouring water is illegal. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3115.7799999999997s)]

*  It's everywhere. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3130.0s)]

*  You don't need Vaseline. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3133.0s)]
*  That's some old boxing shit that needs to be cut out. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3134.0s)]
*  I believe you're right. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3135.0s)]

*  I believe you're right. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3137.0s)]
*  That's just some boxing bullshit that it's probably good for boxing, I guess, but for [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3138.0s)]
*  MMA, that Vaseline gets everywhere. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3141.3199999999997s)]
*  It gets everywhere. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3144.6s)]

*  As a promoter or producer or someone who owns a fight show, you want as many finishes as [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3147.12s)]
*  possible, whether they're knockouts or submissions. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3156.16s)]
*  So you'd want to ... That's why in Combat Jiu-Jitsu, we make rash guards mandatory. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3159.36s)]
*  You got to wear rash guards. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3167.0s)]
*  We don't want too greasy bodies all over the place. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3168.0s)]
*  I like that. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3170.2s)]
*  Wear rash guards. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3171.2s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3172.2s)]
*  We should make you wear ... [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3173.2s)]
*  That cuts out greasing, like the complaint that Gordon Ryan had against Nikki Rod. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3174.2s)]
*  And then Felipe Peña said the same thing. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3179.24s)]
*  He's like, he's greased. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3181.72s)]
*  It's like, feel him. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3182.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's mandatory. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3184.72s)]
*  You got to wear rash guards. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3185.72s)]
*  Ultimately, we haven't done it yet, but ultimately, if there's a problem with greasing legs and [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3187.72s)]
*  stuff like that, we'll probably make it ... You have to wear spats. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3194.24s)]
*  I think spats and rash guards. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3198.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3200.7999999999997s)]
*  Eliminate the greasing. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3201.7999999999997s)]
*  Eliminate it. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3202.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3203.8s)]
*  And isn't that ... If you tested for greasing, that would be so expensive. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3204.8s)]
*  You'd have to ... [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3208.7200000000003s)]
*  And how could you? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3209.7200000000003s)]
*  The only way you could do it is you have ... As you walk in, they swab your back. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3210.7200000000003s)]
*  But the problem is that's not even going to work, because you know what guys do? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3216.88s)]
*  They take a bath in mineral oil. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3220.04s)]
*  So they lay ... That's what Vanderlees do, apparently. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3222.48s)]
*  Old school shit. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3224.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3225.44s)]
*  They take a bath in mineral oil, and then they dry off. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3226.44s)]
*  So if you touch them, they're dry. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3228.7400000000002s)]
*  But then once they start sweating, that oil comes out of the pores, and then they're like, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3230.96s)]
*  whoop. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3234.44s)]
*  It's like trying to grab all of a sand. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3235.44s)]
*  So that could only do so much. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3236.44s)]
*  But when they walk in the cage, they should be warmed up. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3237.84s)]
*  So they should be sweating, so you might be able to ... Maybe take a big glove that is [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3242.84s)]
*  made out of swab material and just go down the back like that, and then test it. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3250.16s)]
*  But that would be expensive as shit. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3255.8s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3257.96s)]
*  You know how that ... I don't even know if this is real. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3259.48s)]
*  But you know how when people pee in the pool, and they have something that shows the pee, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3262.44s)]
*  and you can see it all blue? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3265.12s)]
*  Is that real? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3266.4s)]
*  Oh, that's way real. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3267.4s)]
*  Is it? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3268.48s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3269.48s)]
*  That's old shit. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3270.48s)]
*  I thought that was just some stuff from movies. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3271.48s)]
*  I just read about it too. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3272.48s)]
*  I thought it was a rumor to fuck with kids. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3273.48s)]
*  I don't know if it's real. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3274.48s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3275.48s)]
*  If I know if it's real. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3276.48s)]
*  What would it be called? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3277.48s)]
*  What do you think it would be called? [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3278.48s)]
*  There's some chemical in the ... Is there a chemical you could put to show when you're [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3279.48s)]
*  peeing in a pool? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3282.68s)]
*  Because there was a video that I saw that looked really fake. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3284.92s)]
*  It was a bunch of girls that were in a pool together, and then one girl. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3288.08s)]
*  You see all this pee coming out, this blue. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3291.9199999999996s)]
*  Everyone's like, oh my god, you dirty bitch. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3293.9199999999996s)]
*  They run away from her because she's peeing in the pool. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3296.8799999999997s)]
*  That's for views. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3298.7999999999997s)]
*  No, that's real. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3299.7999999999997s)]

*  I've heard about that. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3304.7999999999997s)]
*  You put a chemical in the pool, and when you pee, it turns blue. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3305.7999999999997s)]
*  Urine indicator dye is a mythical substance that is supposed to be able to react with [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3309.2s)]

*  Oh my god. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3317.72s)]
*  I thought it was real. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3318.72s)]
*  I did too. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3320.24s)]
*  I've been told that a couple weeks ago. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3321.24s)]
*  It doesn't seem like that crazy of a product. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3324.04s)]
*  It might be super toxic. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3327.56s)]
*  Imagine how much of that stuff you'd have to put in the water, and then that stuff's [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3329.72s)]
*  in your eyes. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3334.1s)]
*  Think about how toxic just a regular swimming pool is. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3335.1s)]
*  All the chlorine that's in there. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3338.16s)]
*  Good point. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3339.56s)]
*  That's got to be horrible for you, right? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3340.56s)]
*  You know we played the other day on Protect Our Parks? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3342.08s)]
*  We were trying to figure out why is there fluoride in water? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3347.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's the oldest. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3350.7200000000003s)]
*  There's no reason for fluoride to be in drinking water. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3351.7200000000003s)]
*  That's such an old conspiracy theory. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3355.32s)]
*  It's a real one. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3356.92s)]
*  It's so old. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3357.92s)]
*  And they literally open up bags of fluoride and dump it into the local drinking water. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3358.92s)]
*  It's like something you do. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3366.2400000000002s)]
*  Not only that, we played it on Protect Our Parks. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3367.8s)]
*  We were trying to figure this out. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3369.84s)]
*  There's a direct correlation between high levels of fluoride in drinking water and low [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3371.6s)]
*  IQs. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3375.7200000000003s)]
*  100%. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3377.48s)]
*  Why would they open up sacks of fluoride and put it in the water? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3378.48s)]
*  You know why? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3384.68s)]
*  Because you got fluoride and you're trying to sell that shit. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3385.68s)]
*  Imagine if you're in the fluoride business and you're hearing us talking like, shut the [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3387.9599999999996s)]

*  I don't think I've got much time left. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3719.08s)]
*  When was the last time they had an election? [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3720.08s)]
*  Well, you know that guy, Prokofiev, who tried to make a coup against Putin and he just died [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3721.48s)]
*  in a plane crash. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3727.56s)]
*  Is that that coup that lasted like six hours? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3728.96s)]
*  The guy who like, they were literally headed towards Moscow. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3731.08s)]
*  He was the head of the Wagner group headed towards Moscow. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3734.2s)]
*  And then they pulled back at the last minute and Putin's like, yeah, bro, I'll see you [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3737.48s)]
*  in a little bit. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3741.7999999999997s)]
*  And then his plane blew up in the sky. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3742.7999999999997s)]
*  There's a video of his plane in the sky and it's like on fire in the sky. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3744.72s)]
*  Nothing suspicious about that. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3749.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3751.84s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of crazy. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3752.84s)]
*  But like Soviet Union was communist and then the Soviet Union fell. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3755.96s)]
*  Like the history of the Soviet Union and today's Russia is really confusing to me. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3759.88s)]
*  Like I don't know what to believe. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3765.28s)]
*  I don't know what to believe with anything like when it regards the history, like man, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3766.92s)]
*  it's just like what is real and what's not? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3771.36s)]
*  I'm just like, fuck. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3773.56s)]
*  I just like, OK, let's just see how everything plays out. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3774.56s)]
*  But Soviet Union fell. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3777.2s)]
*  So I thought like Russia is claiming like democratic socialism or something. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3779.32s)]
*  Sort of democratic. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3784.48s)]
*  But Putin is basically running it because Putin was the president of Russia or whatever, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3786.96s)]
*  you know, whatever they call it over there. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3792.44s)]
*  And then he stepped down and then his main guy took over. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3794.4s)]
*  And then Putin's like, fuck this, I'm taking over again. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3799.82s)]
*  Now he's running it and he's been running Russia. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3802.6s)]
*  Was it when did he start running? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3808.68s)]
*  When was his second term as president of Russia? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3810.84s)]
*  I have no, you know, who also has a fucking Soviet passport or Russian passport? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3815.88s)]
*  Roy Jones. Really? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3821.7999999999997s)]
*  Roy Jones, Jr. is tight with Putin. Interesting. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3823.6s)]
*  Yeah. Well, he's a star over there, man. Really? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3826.52s)]
*  Yeah, man. He had a bunch of boxing fights over there. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3829.2s)]
*  They love him over there. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3831.68s)]
*  They love, like, you know, elite combat sports athletes. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3832.7999999999997s)]
*  And Roy Jones, Jr. in his prime was the fucking man. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3835.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. When you talk about the all time greats, you can in his prime. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3840.8799999999997s)]
*  He may. I would say he's the best technician ever. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3847.0s)]
*  One of the best athletes that's ever competed in boxing. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3851.8399999999997s)]
*  He was so fast. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3854.48s)]
*  Think about that one round he had with Vinny Pazienza, where only round [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3855.6s)]
*  CompuBox history. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3861.04s)]
*  Yeah, and CompuBox history where Vinny Pazienza couldn't land a punch. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3862.2400000000002s)]
*  Incredible. Incredible. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3866.84s)]
*  And then Roy tried to stop the fight. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3868.28s)]
*  He was teeing off on him. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3870.7200000000003s)]
*  He said the referee, come on, man, it's over. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3871.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And the referee is like, continue. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3873.96s)]
*  He's like, all righty. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3875.48s)]
*  OK, Putin has been Russia's most powerful politician [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3878.56s)]
*  since he assumed the presidency in 2000. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3881.32s)]
*  After resignation of his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3885.36s)]
*  but he stepped down for a while and then came back again, though. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3888.3999999999996s)]
*  But he was like still kind of in power. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3892.68s)]
*  If he still remains in power until 2036, his tenure will surpass [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3895.56s)]
*  even that of Joseph Stalin, who ruled the Soviet Union for 29 years. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3899.68s)]
*  We're supposed to have six year terms, but he created a new law [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3904.0s)]
*  that can allow that term limit to reset. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3906.4799999999996s)]
*  It's a good move. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3909.2s)]
*  It's a good move if you want to run things. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3911.4399999999996s)]
*  That's what Chris Rock was saying about Trump. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3913.12s)]
*  What did he say? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3916.84s)]
*  When Trump made it into office, like, he's never getting out of there. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3917.48s)]
*  It'll change the fucking laws. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3921.1200000000003s)]
*  He's not going to stop being president. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3922.6400000000003s)]
*  Remember, Chris Rock was saying that on stage. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3925.1600000000003s)]
*  It was hilarious. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3926.84s)]
*  You know that guy, Yuri Besmanov, that you bring up every now and then, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3928.04s)]
*  and he explains ideological subversion, right? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3931.48s)]
*  If that shit's real and it seems like it's real, then does that mean [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3936.96s)]
*  Russia is responsible for all our shit? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3940.08s)]
*  If it's not real, what a prediction. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3942.6400000000003s)]
*  What a crazy prediction that we would lose all faith in our democratic process [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3946.6800000000003s)]

*  Yeah. So are we are we in the middle of a fucking [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3962.2400000000002s)]
*  of a Russian infiltration or is it Chinese? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3966.84s)]
*  Well, I think both of those countries are very clever. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3970.56s)]
*  You know, they do some very clever things. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3974.4s)]
*  One of the things that China does is they buy up corporations. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3977.04s)]
*  Do you know any? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=3979.96s)]

*  And if Yuri Besmanov, if he's right, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4013.4s)]
*  he's basically saying that Russia has has put [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4017.28s)]
*  we're under some kind of like 20 year Russian infiltration, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4023.2000000000003s)]
*  ideological subversion plan. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4026.64s)]
*  Yeah. What he's basically saying was that they have this very [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4028.88s)]
*  long game approach, whereas the United States, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4034.4s)]
*  we try to do things quickly and we think about short term, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4038.6800000000003s)]
*  whereas in Russia, they think about things very long, very long. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4042.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. They're also they're not they don't they're not afraid of people dying over there [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4048.04s)]
*  because they lost so many people in so many wars. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4053.1600000000003s)]

*  And you look at the losses that Russia faced. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4069.72s)]
*  What was that? [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4073.12s)]
*  The one battle that Shane Gillis brought up during the podcast, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4074.68s)]
*  like Shane Gillis is a gigantic history buff, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4077.72s)]

*  fucking insane amount of people [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4085.28s)]

*  That was one of the things that people always said about Russia. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4096.88s)]
*  Like the girls are so hot and there's like they so outnumber men [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4099.68s)]
*  because so many men died. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4104.72s)]
*  Yeah. So many men died over there. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4107.0s)]

*  There's a there's a great awakening and there's a great reset, you know, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4130.52s)]
*  Klaus Schwab talking about the great reset. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4133.8s)]
*  And then there's a great awakening. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4137.6s)]
*  A lot of people are waking up. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4138.84s)]
*  It's like sometimes I feel like the great awakening is winning. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4141.04s)]
*  And then sometimes I feel like the great reset is winning. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4144.12s)]
*  Like when you start like all these fighting that we're doing, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4146.32s)]
*  we're fighting over like dumb shit all the time. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4148.88s)]

*  maybe they just want to just destroy America. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4180.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, how do we destroy America? How do we make it? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4183.92s)]
*  I think what they want is control. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4186.44s)]
*  And they want control the way that China has control, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4188.56s)]
*  the way that Russia has control. Yeah. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4191.76s)]
*  And there's so much freedom in America in terms of freedom of speech [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4193.56s)]
*  and freedom to do whatever you want. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4197.32s)]
*  It's like it's like like on the surface, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4199.36s)]
*  we see the left fighting with the right. Right. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4201.96s)]
*  The surface. Right. But what if the overall goal [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4204.28s)]
*  is to get us like the only way we're going to have [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4209.44s)]
*  like a military regime, like the controllers, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4212.88s)]
*  they want as much of a military regime as possible, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4215.08s)]
*  maybe disguise it so we don't think we're under. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4218.48s)]
*  But the best way to do that, the most [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4220.48s)]

*  I heard about that. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4590.879999999999s)]
*  I don't know too much about that. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4591.599999999999s)]
*  Put it up. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4592.799999999999s)]
*  Pull it up. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4593.36s)]
*  Whitney Comics was complaining about it. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4594.4s)]
*  If you have a house and it's worth a certain amount of money, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4597.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know who pays it, whether it's the buyer or the seller. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4601.759999999999s)]
*  But there's a tax that gets slapped onto it. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4605.36s)]
*  Like if it's worth X amount of money. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4608.639999999999s)]
*  Dude, I got to piss so bad. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4610.5599999999995s)]

*  When Jamie comments on Shane Gillis's Instagram, [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4623.84s)]
*  Shane deletes it. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4627.68s)]
*  It's over football, though. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4628.72s)]
*  Yeah, it was just a gift. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4630.4800000000005s)]
*  It was just like a response. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4631.28s)]
*  You know, Ohio State fun gift. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4632.24s)]
*  And it's gone. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4634.32s)]
*  I was like, well, what happened? [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4634.96s)]
*  Who took it down? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4636.4800000000005s)]
*  Did Instagram? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4637.12s)]
*  I thought Instagram took it down. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4637.6s)]
*  Notre Dame lost? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4638.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I thought Instagram was thinking I was bullying him. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4639.68s)]
*  But that's not the case. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4642.8s)]
*  And who's they? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4644.0s)]
*  I'm thinking about. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4644.8s)]
*  What was it? Ohio State? [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4645.28s)]
*  It is scoring the last play of the game. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4646.400000000001s)]
*  Fourth down. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4647.92s)]
*  Oh, it's run. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4649.04s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4650.16s)]
*  Right down the wire. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4650.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4652.08s)]
*  Football is emotional, man. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4654.64s)]
*  You spend a lot of time. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4657.52s)]
*  Shane believes in censorship. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4658.88s)]
*  That's what I've understood about this whole thing. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4660.08s)]
*  Shane believes in censorship. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4662.72s)]
*  It gets you spend all week thinking about this game Sunday [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4663.92s)]
*  and then you play like shit and you waste three, four hours watching this motherfucker. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4667.76s)]
*  It leaves a bad taste in your mouth. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4672.4800000000005s)]
*  I get it. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4673.92s)]
*  I get it now after I went to that game and I saw how hyped people get in Dallas. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4674.64s)]
*  Seeing the Cowboys play in doubt, Cowboys smoked them, smoking Jets. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4679.76s)]
*  But it was wild watching it, man. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4683.28s)]
*  I was like, this is fun. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4684.88s)]
*  They lost last night and the Cowboys fans are so pissed about it. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4686.0s)]
*  It goes back and forth. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4688.639999999999s)]
*  Dude. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4689.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4690.16s)]
*  Back and forth. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4690.639999999999s)]
*  If you lose, everybody shits on you. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4691.5199999999995s)]
*  If you win, oh, my God, we have a chance to make it to the playoffs. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4693.599999999999s)]
*  It's very emotional. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4696.8s)]
*  There's a lot of shit talking going on in football. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4697.92s)]
*  I can get into it a little bit, but I don't have the time to really get into it. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4700.4s)]
*  I like I'm into it because I've always been into it. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4704.0s)]
*  But it's also I know that sports are a distraction. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4706.08s)]
*  They want like, you know, like empires. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4709.76s)]
*  They like the circus and the distraction. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4711.6s)]
*  I know it's a distraction. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4713.4400000000005s)]
*  It's meant to distract you from what's really going on. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4715.04s)]
*  And it gets you to not pay attention like to, you know, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4718.56s)]
*  what the government's doing to you and all that shit. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4722.88s)]
*  But that might have been why it was initially created. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4725.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4727.6s)]
*  But right now it exists as a beautiful form of entertainment that makes people's lives. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4727.92s)]
*  But I use it for distraction because I'm like, you can't be kept in conspiracy all day. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4732.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4736.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4736.88s)]
*  I need I like watching music documentaries and football. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4737.4400000000005s)]
*  That's what I do to get away from fucking. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4740.88s)]
*  You know what I get? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4742.96s)]
*  I get away from I watch professional pool. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4743.52s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4746.32s)]
*  That's crazier than football. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4747.36s)]
*  Because it's completely apolitical. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4749.84s)]
*  Are there team pool sports? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4752.400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4754.400000000001s)]
*  There's a thing called the Moscone Cup. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4754.64s)]
*  And it's a team. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4757.04s)]
*  It's like Quintet. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4758.16s)]
*  It's like Team USA versus Team Europe. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4759.04s)]
*  It's a big event that happens every year. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4760.96s)]
*  And one year it'll happen in the United States. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4763.12s)]
*  Like last year was in Vegas. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4764.88s)]
*  This year it's in London and that people cheer and scream. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4766.56s)]
*  How many people per team? [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4769.92s)]
*  Wild. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4770.96s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4772.16s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4773.2s)]
*  But they play two at a time. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4773.92s)]
*  So two people play against two people. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4775.6s)]
*  So if you and I were playing. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4777.28s)]
*  So if you're playing nine ball, nine balls rotation pool. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4778.72s)]
*  It means you have to make the one, then you have to make the two. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4781.52s)]
*  And then when you make the nine, you win. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4783.84s)]
*  So if you and I were on a team, you would make the one ball. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4786.16s)]
*  You'd play position for me to make the two ball. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4788.88s)]
*  Then I would make the two ball and then you would make the three ball. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4791.36s)]
*  That's how that's how the game's played. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4795.12s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4798.16s)]
*  I don't like that. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4798.88s)]
*  I like one on one. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4799.92s)]
*  One on one is my favorite. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4801.2s)]
*  Who's the Hicks and Gracie a pool right now? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4802.16s)]
*  Shane Van Boning is a dude from South Dakota who's deaf. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4805.12s)]
*  He turns his hearing aid off when he plays. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4809.04s)]
*  He doesn't hear shit. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4811.92s)]
*  He just goes into his own. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4812.96s)]
*  You could talk shit about him all day. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4814.56s)]
*  You could say crazy things. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4816.0s)]
*  He doesn't even hear it. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4816.96s)]
*  He's just in the zone and he's just dedicated. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4818.24s)]
*  Dude practices eight hours a day. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4821.2s)]
*  He beat this dude in this tournament he played last week. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4823.04s)]
*  He beat this dude 10 to nothing and he ran nine racks. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4826.96s)]
*  So for nine racks, he broke and ran out. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4831.68s)]
*  What's running nine racks? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4834.56s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4836.16s)]
*  It means the other guy doesn't even shoot. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4836.72s)]
*  Because he just made every shot. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4838.08s)]
*  It's crazy that people could do that. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4840.08s)]
*  So good. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4841.68s)]
*  He's so good. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4842.4s)]
*  If you watch him play, he's a machine. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4843.76s)]
*  He makes shots. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4847.36s)]
*  And also getting a shot on the one after the break. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4848.0s)]
*  What are the odds you're going to get a shot on the one? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4851.84s)]
*  He ran seven racks in a row. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4853.68s)]
*  Is there a skill to that? [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4855.68s)]
*  The break? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4856.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4857.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4857.52s)]
*  He's got to hit it as hard as possible. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4858.64s)]
*  It's not as hard as possible. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4860.08s)]
*  It's as accurate as possible. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4861.360000000001s)]
*  And sometimes it's the right speed. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4862.72s)]
*  Sometimes if you hit it too hard, the balls scatter too much and you don't have control. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4864.88s)]
*  But if you hit it just the right speed, you will make the one ball on the side and the two ball [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4869.76s)]
*  likely will bounce out and get a shot. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4875.52s)]
*  And this motherfucker ran seven racks in a row in a big tournament against the best players in the world. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4877.6s)]
*  And then he ran two more racks and then he fucking won the game. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4883.68s)]
*  And he's an American? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4886.88s)]
*  He's an American. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4887.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4888.64s)]
*  He's maybe the best of all. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4889.360000000001s)]
*  Are there countries that produce, is it random or is there certain countries that produce good footballs? [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4890.320000000001s)]
*  I'm a big fan of the guys from China. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4894.96s)]
*  Huge. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4897.68s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4897.92s)]
*  I'm a huge fan of the guys from China and the guys from the Philippines. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4898.56s)]
*  Those are some of my favorite players. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4902.72s)]
*  And Taiwan. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4904.240000000001s)]
*  There's just two brothers out of Taiwan, the Ko brothers. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4905.12s)]
*  Ko Pin Yee and Ko Ping Chung. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4907.92s)]
*  They're my favorite players to watch. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4909.6s)]
*  I love watching those guys play. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4910.88s)]
*  Do they ever play against each other? [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4912.4s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4913.92s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4914.5599999999995s)]
*  It's funny watching them play because they have the same kind of style. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4915.28s)]
*  It's like the Rotolo brothers. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4917.5199999999995s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4918.799999999999s)]
*  They had to fight in the finals of, I think it was the Brown Belt, Gee Worlds or was it Black Belt? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4920.08s)]
*  But yeah, they don't fake shit, dude. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4927.36s)]
*  No. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4929.759999999999s)]
*  The Rotolo brothers are fucking animals. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4930.32s)]
*  Animals. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4932.5599999999995s)]
*  Those guys are animals. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4933.12s)]
*  All natural too. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4933.679999999999s)]
*  And they're like 20 years old. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4934.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4936.32s)]
*  And they're amongst the best in the world. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4936.639999999999s)]
*  And they're just getting started. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4939.04s)]
*  And they have a deal with 1FC too. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4940.16s)]
*  They do the 1FC grappling over there. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4941.76s)]
*  That's another thing I love about 1FC. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4943.68s)]
*  They got Mike Musometti over there. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4945.2s)]
*  And I love it. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4946.96s)]
*  They mix it up. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4948.08s)]
*  I love that they do that. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4948.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4949.280000000001s)]
*  You go to, they, Shatri invited me to that Denver show, the first US show. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4949.76s)]
*  That was insane, man. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4955.12s)]
*  That was insane. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4956.56s)]
*  It was just a mix of kickboxing, MMA, grappling. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4957.2s)]
*  And the grapplers came out with like, you know, they look like superstars. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4961.4400000000005s)]
*  Like the Rotolo brothers, Mike Musometti, they're superstars. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4965.2s)]
*  What I love about Shatri and what he's doing with 1FC is [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4968.8s)]
*  they're embracing all the aspects of martial arts. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4971.36s)]
*  They have Muay Thai with little gloves. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4974.08s)]
*  They have Jiu Jitsu. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4976.88s)]
*  They have real fucking elite level MMA. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4978.32s)]
*  It's fucking great. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4982.799999999999s)]
*  They even have kickboxing. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4983.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4984.96s)]
*  So they have kickboxing, which is no elbows, you know, no, no clinch. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4985.36s)]
*  Oh, they have regular kickboxing. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4990.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4991.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4992.32s)]
*  What style is that called? [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4992.5599999999995s)]
*  Kickboxing, like Glory. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4994.0s)]
*  Glory is regular kickboxing. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4994.96s)]
*  No elbows. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4996.5599999999995s)]
*  No elbows. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4997.28s)]
*  No knees. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4997.839999999999s)]
*  No knees. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4998.48s)]
*  You can go knees. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4999.12s)]
*  You can go knees. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=4999.839999999999s)]
*  But you can't clinch and throw knees the way everybody else does. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5000.48s)]
*  It's like K-1. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5004.32s)]
*  K-1 was kickboxing. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5005.28s)]
*  It's not. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5006.719999999999s)]
*  K-1 is not MMA. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5007.2s)]
*  Excuse me. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5008.639999999999s)]
*  It's not Muay Thai. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5009.12s)]
*  So K-1 does not allow elbows. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5010.0s)]
*  K-1 does not allow elbows, but they do allow a brief clinch. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5012.4s)]
*  Yep. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5016.719999999999s)]
*  A brief clinch, one knee, one knee from the clinch. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5017.04s)]
*  You can't hold on like Anderson Silva did with Rich Franklin. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5020.639999999999s)]
*  Hold on and just batter him with knees. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5023.5199999999995s)]
*  Remember when Anderson Silva got that plum on Rich Franklin and just destroyed him. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5025.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5030.96s)]
*  That was... [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5031.28s)]
*  Bro, Anderson in his prime. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5032.08s)]
*  The interesting thing about, or one of the interesting things about [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5035.04s)]
*  Anderson Silva, there's so many, but he was like middle of the road for a while. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5038.48s)]
*  He was just one of those dudes from Shootbox coming up. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5042.88s)]
*  He was winning. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5046.32s)]
*  He was losing. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5047.04s)]
*  He fought Ryu. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5047.92s)]
*  What was that guy's name? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5049.44s)]
*  The Japanese guy that did the flying... [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5050.16s)]
*  Flying heel hook on him. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5052.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5053.2s)]
*  It was one of those... [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5054.24s)]
*  He was Mayhem's training partner. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5055.5199999999995s)]
*  What was that dude's name? [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5057.759999999999s)]
*  Ryu. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5058.719999999999s)]
*  God damn it. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5059.44s)]
*  Anderson Silva versus... [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5061.2s)]
*  I'm embarrassed that I forgot his name. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5063.44s)]
*  I'm embarrassed too. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5064.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5065.679999999999s)]
*  It starts with an R though. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5065.919999999999s)]
*  I know that. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5067.04s)]
*  That guy was good. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5067.5199999999995s)]
*  He threw that crazy flying scissor take down to a heel hook, which is like... [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5069.04s)]
*  That's pro wrestling. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5074.4s)]
*  Well, it's actually... [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5076.4s)]
*  It's legit, but... [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5078.0s)]
*  That's it right there. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5081.04s)]
*  Rio Chonan. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5082.32s)]
*  There we go. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5083.2s)]
*  I was right with the R. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5084.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5085.5199999999995s)]
*  Check out this fight. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5086.5599999999995s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5087.68s)]
*  It was a good fight too. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5089.52s)]
*  So this was Anderson before he went to cage rage. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5091.52s)]
*  Remember he went to cage rage? [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5095.360000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5096.72s)]
*  And when he went to cage rage, that's when he became the fucking man. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5097.12s)]
*  When he went to cage rage... [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5102.400000000001s)]
*  Bro, so Rio Chonan, he threw this flying... [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5104.56s)]
*  Is it going to show it in here? [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5107.68s)]
*  Like they're discussing it. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5108.8s)]

*  Boom. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5115.200000000001s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5116.08s)]
*  That is crazy. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5116.88s)]
*  Yeah, that was like Marvin Castell. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5118.24s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5119.6s)]
*  The way he did it, crazy. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5120.4800000000005s)]
*  That move, by the way, is illegal in my tournament. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5123.36s)]
*  Really? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5127.4400000000005s)]
*  Because it's too many knees get destroyed. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5128.32s)]
*  You can just break a leg right there. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5130.56s)]
*  I witnessed right in front of my face a leg getting destroyed. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5132.56s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, that is banned. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5136.0s)]
*  We are banning that one. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5138.16s)]
*  What happened? [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5139.76s)]
*  You know, one of my students just did that move that you just saw. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5141.76s)]
*  And he landed on the shin and it fucking snapped, man. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5145.04s)]
*  And it was not good. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5150.32s)]
*  What happened to Richie? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5151.84s)]
*  Did Richie get his leg snapped recently? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5153.92s)]
*  With Craig Jones? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5156.64s)]
*  He tweaked it. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5158.72s)]
*  He heard it. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5159.44s)]
*  Craig Jones did some crazy behind the back toe hole thing. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5160.0s)]
*  It was fucking crazy. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5164.72s)]
*  But yeah, Craig Jones is doing some wild shit, man. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5166.48s)]
*  Craig Jones, one of the best in the world. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5169.44s)]
*  One of the best to do it. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5171.12s)]
*  And they won the quintet team tournament. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5172.5599999999995s)]
*  It was fucking badass, man. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5176.8s)]
*  We got to the finals against B Team and Craig Jones just too much. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5178.24s)]
*  We did great. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5184.8s)]
*  My guys did great. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5185.36s)]
*  Everybody did great, man. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5186.48s)]
*  It looked like a break. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5187.68s)]
*  That's why I was scared. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5188.8s)]
*  It looked like he broke his ankle. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5190.0s)]
*  Maybe something got cracked, but he didn't tell me. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5192.48s)]
*  We were walking right afterwards. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5195.12s)]
*  It wasn't limping or anything. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5196.4s)]
*  Okay, so it just popped. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5198.08s)]
*  Yeah, a little pop on the outside. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5199.36s)]
*  If it pops on the outside, there's really nothing you can really do. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5201.68s)]
*  I mean, there's no surgery for it. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5205.68s)]
*  You just wait it out. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5207.360000000001s)]
*  You just wait it out. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5209.360000000001s)]
*  I've had my ankle pop many times, and then it's sore and tender for a long time. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5210.64s)]
*  I had my ankle popped once, and it swole up, and then the whole thing was black. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5215.84s)]
*  My whole ankle is black. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5221.280000000001s)]
*  I was like, oh my god, I'm never going to throw a kick again. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5222.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5225.92s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5226.56s)]
*  Yeah, here it is. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5227.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, that was after. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5228.240000000001s)]
*  It's hard to see what happened. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5229.200000000001s)]
*  I could show you, but... [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5230.08s)]
*  Yeah, you show it right before this. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5230.8s)]
*  So here it is. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5232.64s)]
*  Before that? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5233.28s)]
*  Okay, so look at him. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5234.8s)]
*  He reaches with his left hand. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5236.56s)]
*  He reaches behind his back like right there. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5237.68s)]
*  Look at left hand, right there, and then he puts a toe hold. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5239.52s)]
*  So he's got his left hand on one side of Richie's leg and his right hand in between the legs [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5242.320000000001s)]
*  with a toe hold. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5248.08s)]
*  You couldn't really see it in that angle, but I never really seen that before. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5248.96s)]
*  It was... [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5253.4400000000005s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5253.92s)]
*  Boom. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5254.400000000001s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5254.88s)]
*  Do you remember when Craig Jones had that match with Vinnie [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5256.88s)]
*  and he broke his ankle? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5261.280000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5262.72s)]
*  He broke his shit. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5263.4400000000005s)]
*  He broke his shin bone, right? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5264.8s)]
*  I don't know the... [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5266.96s)]
*  I think it was his shin bone. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5268.08s)]
*  The exact damage he did. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5269.76s)]
*  Because Craig tried to tell him, hey, it's broke. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5271.12s)]
*  He's like, it's okay. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5273.04s)]
*  It's like, yeah, but it's broken. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5274.56s)]
*  That was gruesome. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5276.0s)]
*  It's like moving around. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5276.64s)]
*  Yeah, that was gruesome. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5277.92s)]
*  I talked to Vinnie when Vinnie was at Abu Dhabi. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5278.96s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I'm still kind of fucked up. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5281.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5283.12s)]
*  I think he had to get a plate now. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5283.52s)]
*  Vinnie was one of the first leg lock pioneers in ADCC. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5284.72s)]
*  People forget about that. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5289.52s)]
*  He won the whole thing, I think, in 2007 or 2009 or something. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5291.200000000001s)]
*  And he was heel hooking the shit out of people. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5296.64s)]
*  Him and Dean Lester. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5298.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5300.0s)]
*  They came out and... [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5300.400000000001s)]
*  I think Vinnie's the last guy to beat Gordon. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5301.200000000001s)]
*  Is he the last one? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5304.56s)]
*  I believe so. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5305.4400000000005s)]
*  I think so. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5306.160000000001s)]
*  Do you remember when Vinnie did a flying arm bar on Pei DiPano? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5307.120000000001s)]
*  I don't remember that. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5312.080000000001s)]
*  And the Jiu Jitsu match? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5313.68s)]
*  No Gi. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5315.200000000001s)]
*  I don't remember that. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5316.320000000001s)]
*  On Pei DiPano? [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5317.280000000001s)]
*  Beautiful. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5318.320000000001s)]
*  Let's see if we can find that. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5318.96s)]
*  Beautiful. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5319.84s)]

*  Vinnie Magalhães. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5322.56s)]
*  Pei DiPano's a fucking animal. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5323.76s)]
*  Yeah, I don't remember that one at all. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5325.6s)]
*  He hit him on a flying arm bar. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5326.64s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5328.8s)]
*  Vinnie Magalhães, Pei DiPano, flying arm bar. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5330.0s)]
*  Oh, it's fucking gorgeous. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5333.4400000000005s)]
*  And to see a guy do that on a world champion at that high a level and to catch it... [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5335.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5340.56s)]
*  It was picture perfect. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5340.8s)]
*  Yeah, and what I was saying about Anderson Silva was [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5344.4800000000005s)]
*  he didn't come out as the baddest motherfucker on the planet right away. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5346.8s)]
*  It took a while. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5351.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5352.88s)]
*  And then he went to cage rage. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5353.360000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5355.6s)]
*  And he started fucking people up. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5356.0s)]
*  That's when it came apart. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5356.96s)]
*  What was his biggest win in cage rage? [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5358.240000000001s)]
*  Lee Murray. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5359.68s)]
*  Oh, remember that? [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5361.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5362.96s)]
*  Murray was a fucking killer. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5363.280000000001s)]
*  There's a documentary about him. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5364.72s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5365.92s)]
*  Yeah, I was talking to Guy Ritchie about it. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5367.200000000001s)]
*  Lee Murray was a real gangster who could fight. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5369.84s)]
*  He wound up being part of the crew that committed the biggest armed robbery in the history of the UK. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5374.64s)]
*  Insane. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5382.72s)]
*  They had like a movie, like Heat, full face masks on and goggles and fucking tactical equipment, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5383.04s)]
*  bulletproof vests. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5390.4800000000005s)]
*  And they robbed everything. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5392.0s)]
*  I think they stole like $50 million. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5393.28s)]
*  Something crazy. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5396.0s)]
*  And they got away with it for a while. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5397.28s)]
*  Sort of. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5400.24s)]
*  Everybody kind of knew. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5400.64s)]

*  If you're doing something like that, you got friends and you're telling your friends [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5411.04s)]
*  and those friends are probably going to get arrested and then they're going to be fucking, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5414.0s)]

*  He fought in MMA too, but it didn't really pan out for him. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5440.72s)]
*  I believe in the geek. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5445.92s)]

*  No. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5531.76s)]
*  When are you going to upgrade? [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5532.0s)]
*  I did. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5533.2s)]
*  I just got a new one. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5533.679999999999s)]
*  You get a 15? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5534.48s)]
*  Dude, coffee and beer just make me want to piss all the time. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5535.28s)]

*  Goes right through you. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5538.96s)]
*  Dude, sorry about that. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5539.92s)]
*  No worries, man. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5541.2s)]
*  That's the whole reason why we could pause. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5542.32s)]
*  We're not going to find that video. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5544.5599999999995s)]
*  But what was another video that we were trying to find? [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5545.759999999999s)]
*  Another great ADCC classic moment was when Davi Ramos. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5550.48s)]
*  Davi Ramos got a flying arm bar. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5556.32s)]
*  That was 2015 in Sao Paulo. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5558.48s)]
*  Davi Ramos, so fucking hell. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5560.48s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5562.08s)]
*  He found the UFC a little bit, right? [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5562.719999999999s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5564.24s)]
*  I was surprised that he didn't go further. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5564.799999999999s)]
*  I had a feeling he was going to smoke everybody [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5567.759999999999s)]
*  once it got to the ground. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5569.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5570.719999999999s)]
*  I just felt like, how are you going to stop that guy? [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5571.44s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5574.24s)]
*  His arm bar was fucking insane. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5575.04s)]
*  It is so hard to make the transition to the UFC. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5577.28s)]
*  It's so hard. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5580.48s)]
*  Dude, you've got to have your striking on point. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5581.92s)]
*  You've got to have everything on point. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5584.96s)]
*  It's almost like striking in wrestling, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5586.639999999999s)]
*  because every fight, every round starts on your feet. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5589.599999999999s)]
*  That's the most important thing. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5592.72s)]
*  You're striking and you're wrestling. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5594.16s)]
*  In the early days, you can get away with just being really good [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5595.599999999999s)]
*  at jiu-jitsu and getting a clinch and dragging the fight to the ground. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5599.68s)]
*  Not anymore. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5604.16s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5604.8s)]
*  Everybody's hard to take down now. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5605.4400000000005s)]
*  There's no more easy takedowns. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5606.88s)]
*  You know who's crazy who's still in the mix? [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5608.400000000001s)]
*  Well, it was until recently, Hanayaya. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5611.04s)]
*  That guy was around forever. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5614.400000000001s)]
*  He got to the finals of the Abu Dhabi I was in, 2003. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5617.84s)]
*  He was 17 and got to the finals against Leo Vieira. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5622.320000000001s)]
*  And he was fighting in the UFC recently. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5626.72s)]
*  Yeah, he's really good. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5629.44s)]
*  He's really good. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5630.56s)]
*  That guy understands the clinch game. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5631.68s)]
*  If he would have been on just a little more striking, [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5633.28s)]
*  if he would have been a better striker, just a little... [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5640.64s)]
*  He is his jiu-jitsu man. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5644.16s)]
*  He had good MMA jiu-jitsu. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5646.32s)]
*  He was all about squeezing and clinching and smashing. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5648.8s)]
*  And he got a lot of that from Hickson. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5652.56s)]
*  Hickson took him under his wing for a little bit. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5654.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5656.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Hickson was in his corner for a while. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5657.36s)]
*  He's a squeezer. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5659.2s)]
*  A squeezer, not... [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5660.24s)]
*  Team constrictor. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5661.44s)]
*  That was his team. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5662.48s)]
*  Yeah, not all jiu-jitsu champions coming from the Gi. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5663.36s)]
*  Not all of them are squeeze machines. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5667.759999999999s)]
*  Some of them are really good at collar chokes. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5670.879999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5673.679999999999s)]
*  And they're just death with those things. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5674.32s)]
*  They get a hand in your collar, man. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5677.04s)]
*  You're going to sleep. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5678.96s)]
*  Remember when Murillo Bustamante had to tap Matt Lindland twice? [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5680.08s)]
*  Murillo Bustamante was the one who upkicked Jerry Bolander. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5685.6s)]
*  Buzzy? [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5689.360000000001s)]
*  I think so. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5690.64s)]
*  I think it was Murillo Bustamante up... [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5691.280000000001s)]
*  Because I said before it was Fabio Giorgio. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5693.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5695.200000000001s)]
*  I think it... [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5696.4800000000005s)]
*  I get the names mixed up, but I'm pretty sure it was Bustamante. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5697.280000000001s)]
*  How about when he tapped out Matt Lindland twice? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5700.240000000001s)]
*  You're talking about that? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5702.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5703.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5703.6s)]
*  He did one fight. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5703.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5705.12s)]
*  The craziest fight ever. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5705.68s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5706.88s)]
*  Big John McCarthy separated them. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5707.92s)]
*  Said the fight was over. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5710.72s)]
*  Matt Lindland's like, I didn't tap. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5712.240000000001s)]
*  Be definitely tapped. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5714.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5715.68s)]
*  And then they didn't have instant replay back then. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5716.4800000000005s)]
*  So Big John's like, okay, fight again. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5719.6s)]
*  Keep fighting. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5723.68s)]
*  And Murillo was like, what the fuck? [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5724.72s)]
*  I think they went a whole round after that. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5726.96s)]
*  And then the next round, Murillo caught him in a guillotine. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5729.200000000001s)]
*  Crazy shit. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5732.56s)]
*  That happened... [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5733.12s)]
*  That kind of happened when... [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5734.160000000001s)]
*  Soccerraba. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5736.64s)]
*  When I was in... [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5737.52s)]
*  I commentated for a show called Too Hot to Handle in Amsterdam. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5738.240000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5741.84s)]
*  In Amsterdam. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5742.72s)]
*  I remember that. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5743.360000000001s)]
*  And Gilbert Ivo. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5744.0s)]
*  Remember him? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5747.6s)]
*  Sure. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5748.24s)]
*  Man, what a scary dude that was. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5749.12s)]
*  That guy, he was the one in Pride 10 that threw one strike against Gary Goodrich. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5751.04s)]
*  One strike, one head kick, and he went down. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5758.4s)]
*  Let's see what this is. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5761.76s)]
*  What's this? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5762.64s)]
*  Oh, this is it. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5763.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5764.56s)]
*  We found it. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5765.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5765.68s)]
*  This is deep, deep searching. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5766.16s)]
*  But we found it. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5767.52s)]
*  Damn, let it go. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5768.0s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5768.88s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5769.92s)]
*  It's so beautiful, dude. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5770.4s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5773.36s)]
*  Wow. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5775.2s)]
*  How beautiful is that? [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5776.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5777.36s)]
*  Look, he's wearing tights. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5777.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5778.96s)]
*  Beautiful. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5779.599999999999s)]
*  No greasing on him. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5780.5599999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5782.08s)]
*  Not at all. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5782.799999999999s)]
*  Did he tap that quick? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5783.599999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5784.32s)]
*  Yeah, he knew it was over. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5784.88s)]
*  Dude, let's see that whole thing again. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5786.08s)]
*  Right as he was going down, he was already extending the arm. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5788.5599999999995s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5793.04s)]
*  He's got the collar tie, off the collar tie. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5793.679999999999s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5795.28s)]
*  Boom. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5795.839999999999s)]
*  He went on the left arm. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5796.48s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5797.919999999999s)]
*  That was quick. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5798.5599999999995s)]
*  That's huge. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5799.679999999999s)]
*  He probably verbal tapped. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5800.24s)]
*  Yeah, I see. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5801.2s)]
*  Yeah, amazing. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5802.4s)]
*  That was when Vinny was training with you. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5804.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5805.839999999999s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5807.36s)]
*  Damn. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5808.799999999999s)]
*  To do that to a guy that high level, I mean, that's fucking incredible. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5810.32s)]
*  See if you could find Davi Ramos, ADCC 2015, flying armbar. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5814.32s)]
*  It's, I don't know. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5819.919999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's so beautiful. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5822.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5825.04s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's different than this one, but it's equally impressive, I think. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5825.6s)]
*  Really, we should give props to our guy. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5831.360000000001s)]
*  Who's our guy? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5833.84s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5835.280000000001s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5835.76s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5836.08s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5836.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he jumped on him. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5837.04s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5838.240000000001s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5838.8s)]
*  Done. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5841.200000000001s)]
*  Over. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5842.0s)]
*  That was so quick. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5842.400000000001s)]
*  Davi Ramos is a fucking animal. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5843.360000000001s)]
*  Damn. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5844.8s)]
*  He just caught him reaching. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5849.280000000001s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5850.400000000001s)]
*  Woo. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5850.88s)]
*  And Davi Ramos, he's really, he's one of those Brazilians, one of the first Brazilians [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5851.76s)]
*  that came out with high level leg locks. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5857.200000000001s)]
*  He's a leg locker. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5860.88s)]
*  He's a Brazilian leg locker. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5861.68s)]
*  There's a couple out there that came up that people forgot about. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5862.96s)]
*  And when, do you remember when Alan Belcher fought Rusamar Paharas? [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5866.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5871.280000000001s)]
*  Rusamar Paharas was probably the most feared Brazilian leg locker ever. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5871.84s)]
*  The guy's huge as jack. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5876.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5878.320000000001s)]
*  He looked like Ken Shamrock in his prime, you know? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5878.56s)]
*  And he's a leg locker. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5881.04s)]
*  He just rips people's legs apart. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5884.08s)]
*  Alan trained to avoid the leg locks. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5885.28s)]
*  Alan brought in Davi Ramos, Davi Ramos, and Dean Lister for his training camp. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5887.84s)]
*  And he had him out there for a month. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5894.96s)]
*  And Alan Belcher told me, he goes, those dudes are fucking me up. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5898.08s)]
*  Dean Lister and Davi Ramos with leg locks. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5902.8s)]
*  It's over and over. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5904.56s)]
*  But after a while, I started slowing him down, started countering, started defending, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5905.44s)]
*  started pulling out. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5910.32s)]
*  And by the time that UFC match against Rusamar Paharas came around, [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5911.5199999999995s)]
*  that was one of the greatest UFC fights of all time. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5916.24s)]
*  It was amazing because he engaged. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5918.16s)]
*  Dude, he had Alan Belcher. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5920.08s)]
*  But first, Alan Belcher pulls him into a fucking twister, dude. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5923.36s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5926.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5927.44s)]
*  He comes in, he comes in, Rusamar Paharas comes in with a single. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5928.16s)]
*  Alan Belcher doesn't even fight the single. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5932.48s)]
*  He just transitions that into the truck and he almost twisters him. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5934.32s)]
*  Dude gets out and then he's all over Alan Belcher's legs. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5939.28s)]
*  He's all over those legs and Alan's just defending, defending, pulling out, defending. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5943.12s)]
*  He had really good looks on his legs. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5948.5599999999995s)]
*  And then he finally got out and fucking grounded and pounded his way to the stoppage. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5950.48s)]
*  Alan Belcher is a heavyweight bare knuckle fighter now. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5955.04s)]
*  He's fighting bare knuckle now? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5959.28s)]
*  Did you not know? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5960.4s)]
*  I did not know. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5961.2s)]
*  He was a champion. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5961.28s)]
*  I did not know. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5962.24s)]
*  He relinquished his title so he could fight for Jorge Masvidal. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5962.88s)]
*  So he's fighting Jorge Masvidal's MMA fight. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5966.56s)]
*  He's fighting against Roy Big Country Nelson. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5970.8s)]
*  And the winner of that is now going to fight Junior dos Santos. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5974.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5977.84s)]

*  I had no idea. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5979.68s)]
*  You want to go? [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5980.56s)]
*  Let's do it. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5981.120000000001s)]
*  Let's go to Miami. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5981.76s)]
*  I think it's in Florida in April. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5983.52s)]
*  I think that's when the big match is. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5986.400000000001s)]
*  I think Alan Belcher is fighting. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5988.4800000000005s)]
*  November 10th. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5992.080000000001s)]

*  And then the winner of that is going to fight Junior dos Santos. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=5995.04s)]
*  Bro, Alan Belcher can fucking box. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6000.24s)]
*  And he's a heavyweight now, man. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6003.6s)]
*  Let's see Alan Belcher, Russomar Paharis. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6005.6s)]
*  That's got to be up for free. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6007.84s)]
*  Dude, that one is 100% just violence the whole way through. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6009.12s)]
*  There's no stopping that one, dude. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6013.6s)]
*  That's a great fight. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6015.12s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6015.84s)]
*  Alan Belcher just... [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6016.72s)]
*  And I remember after that, I'm like, dude, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6018.48s)]
*  you got to put out a fucking leg lock defense. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6020.32s)]
*  They go right here. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6024.24s)]

*  Alan's so smart. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6033.12s)]
*  He's such a smart dude. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6034.799999999999s)]
*  He looks so different now because now he doesn't cut any weight. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6036.24s)]
*  He got jacked, shaved his head. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6039.36s)]

*  He's going for the twister. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6063.76s)]
*  Would that have been the first twister in MMA or had the Korean Zomedy? [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6065.280000000001s)]
*  That would have been the first one, I think. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6068.8s)]
*  Wow. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6070.0s)]

*  Alan uses that left leg. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6136.240000000001s)]
*  They bust free. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6137.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6138.400000000001s)]

*  I mean, the size. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6309.84s)]

*  It's over. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6318.08s)]
*  So he's about to fight big country. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6318.96s)]
*  They're going to fight in Jorge Masvidal's... [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6321.84s)]
*  Which I fucking loved. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6324.16s)]
*  I really loved Masvidal's premiere event. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6325.6s)]
*  Or not premiere event. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6328.88s)]
*  He's had a couple of them. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6330.0s)]
*  But the last one he did with Junior Dos Santos and Fabesio were doing. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6330.88s)]
*  Bro, bare-knuckle changes everything. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6335.04s)]
*  Changes everything. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6336.88s)]
*  You can't take those shots. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6337.84s)]
*  And the crazy thing is he's a business guru. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6338.72s)]
*  Masvidal? [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6342.16s)]
*  No. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6342.88s)]
*  Alan Belcher. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6343.52s)]
*  Alan is, yeah. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6343.92s)]
*  Alan Belcher, dude. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6344.72s)]
*  He has like a... [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6345.76s)]
*  So this is Junior. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6348.56s)]
*  This is Junior and Fabricio. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6349.4400000000005s)]
*  But this is like not the best fight. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6350.88s)]
*  It was mostly Fabricio Verdoom just getting punched in the face. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6353.36s)]
*  He just like... [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6357.84s)]
*  Junior with that boxing, that style that he has, he slices you with those punches. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6358.56s)]
*  You can only take so much of those. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6363.6s)]
*  And Fabricio got a really nasty cut over one of his eyes. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6365.28s)]
*  At the end of it, he's like really jacked up. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6369.36s)]
*  So that's... [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6372.16s)]
*  I'm in full support of Masvidal's organization. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6373.599999999999s)]
*  I love that he's doing that. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6376.639999999999s)]
*  I think that's how MMA should be done. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6378.32s)]
*  Bare-knuckle. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6380.24s)]
*  So they're going to have that Roy big country Nelson fight. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6381.36s)]
*  And then the other one, we should go. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6383.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6385.04s)]
*  We should go to the big one. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6385.54s)]
*  I'll check my schedule. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6387.12s)]
*  Thumb free that weekend. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6388.0s)]
*  Let's do it. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6388.88s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6389.36s)]
*  It's in Miami? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6389.679999999999s)]
*  Go. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6390.4s)]
*  I think it's in Florida. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6390.639999999999s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's in Florida. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6391.599999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure it's in Miami, but it's somewhere in Florida. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6392.639999999999s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6395.36s)]
*  Let's do it. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6395.76s)]
*  Masvidal reached out and I said, fuck yeah, dude. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6396.32s)]
*  I'll go with that. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6398.48s)]
*  I want to see that. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6399.2s)]
*  I want to support it. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6401.2s)]
*  Crazy shit. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6401.84s)]
*  And Fabrice Verdun was in there. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6402.48s)]
*  That guy's a legend. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6405.5199999999995s)]
*  A Jiu-Jitsu legend, MMA legend. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6407.599999999999s)]
*  And he, like Anderson Silva in the beginning, he was like middle of the road. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6410.08s)]
*  He was a Jiu-Jitsu champion, didn't really have that good striking. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6415.92s)]
*  I think he fought in Dream maybe, maybe Pride. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6420.08s)]
*  And he was up and coming, big Brazilian, amazing Jiu-Jitsu, [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6422.5599999999995s)]
*  but his striking hadn't come together. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6426.5599999999995s)]
*  And then a lot of Jiu-Jitsu black belts and a lot of Jiu-Jitsu champions, [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6428.8s)]
*  they'll dip into MMA a little bit. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6434.56s)]
*  Then they realize, you know what? [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6436.08s)]
*  My striking ain't there. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6437.52s)]
*  I'll just have a school and just make money with my school and that's fine. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6438.8s)]
*  But some stay and they just fucking, they just tough it out and they just keep going [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6442.8s)]
*  and they keep going like Anderson Silva. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6447.2s)]
*  His Jiu-Jitsu wasn't that good, but he kept going. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6448.96s)]
*  And then his Jiu-Jitsu got good. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6450.88s)]
*  He triangle Chao Sun. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6452.16s)]
*  And same thing with Fabrice Verdun. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6453.2s)]
*  He kept going and then he turned into like a legit striker knocking out people with headkicks. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6455.28s)]
*  He just kept going forward. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6462.4s)]
*  How about let's look at Anderson Silva versus Dan Henderson. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6463.2s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6467.679999999999s)]
*  Remember that one? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6468.4s)]
*  That's Anderson in his prime. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6469.5199999999995s)]
*  That's Anderson top of the food chain, apex predator, [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6472.96s)]
*  perhaps the greatest 185 pound that's ever lived. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6478.08s)]
*  When he was on, man, you know, and Dan Henderson just is an animal. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6481.76s)]
*  Dude. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6487.52s)]
*  Throwing fucking vicious, vicious bombs. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6488.16s)]
*  But this was Anderson Silva when he was in the matrix. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6491.04s)]
*  When he would just stand out and bow to everybody. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6494.320000000001s)]
*  This is a great fucking fight, man. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6496.56s)]
*  Because Dan Henderson was so fucking dangerous. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6498.56s)]
*  This is Dan in his prime. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6501.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6502.56s)]
*  And he had that fucking ridiculous power. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6503.52s)]
*  Dan Henderson, like if you touch him, he's like made out of wood. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6507.2s)]
*  He feels like this table. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6510.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6512.0s)]
*  Now, right hand is ridiculous. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6513.04s)]
*  And he's just such an elite fucking wrestler, too. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6515.44s)]
*  And so Anderson just kind of timed him up a little bit. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6521.68s)]
*  This is what Anderson would do. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6524.88s)]
*  He would spend the beginning of the round just kind of moving around, [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6526.56s)]
*  looking to see how you move, putting it all on that computer. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6529.6s)]
*  And then towards the end of the round, Anderson would start opening up. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6533.6s)]
*  And once he started opening up, man, he was fucking lethal. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6540.08s)]
*  Because you had to close the distance on him because Anderson was a counterstriker. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6542.8s)]
*  So he would stand there and make you lead. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6546.08s)]
*  And when you lead, you're running into fucking [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6548.56s)]
*  the biggest buzzsaw that ever exists in this division. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6552.32s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6556.88s)]
*  I forget Dan got him down. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6557.44s)]
*  How did he get him down? [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6558.64s)]
*  Let's see how he got him down. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6559.6s)]
*  Does it just cut right to it? [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6562.48s)]
*  This video is slightly edited. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6564.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6565.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6566.4s)]
*  It just shows him taking him down. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6566.64s)]
*  He looked like he almost had he has like a leg drag position. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6568.16s)]
*  Yeah, he's almost in half guard or it's almost in side control. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6571.44s)]
*  Anybody Dan Henderson touches with that right hand, nobody survived that shit. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6574.32s)]
*  I know. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6578.5599999999995s)]
*  He's a wrestler with the fucking Mike Tyson right hand. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6580.639999999999s)]
*  Do you remember his knockout of Van Der Lee in the rematch? [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6584.4s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6586.88s)]
*  The bizbing one. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6589.28s)]
*  The bizbing one was insane. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6591.28s)]
*  Now, this is Anderson when he's got his groove, right? [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6593.76s)]
*  This is Anderson loose. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6596.16s)]
*  Boom, head kick. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6598.16s)]
*  Boom. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6600.0s)]
*  Oh, this is all edited up. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6601.68s)]
*  So he stands up. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6605.599999999999s)]
*  Henderson's got the clinch. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6608.5599999999995s)]
*  It was a good fight. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6612.48s)]
*  I forgot how good this fight was. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6613.2s)]
*  Scooch a little. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6620.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6624.5599999999995s)]
*  So how did he get him down though? [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6625.2s)]
*  Back it up. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6628.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6628.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6629.76s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6631.76s)]
*  That's where it happened. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6632.4s)]
*  It started from stand up. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6633.28s)]
*  Man, it's weird how they're cutting out the takedowns. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6635.84s)]
*  Yeah, I don't understand that. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6638.08s)]
*  It's very important how it's like got to there. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6639.04s)]
*  But the fact that he's on top right here, that's fucking like what? [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6640.4s)]
*  I know. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6643.5199999999995s)]
*  He's on top of a world class wrestler. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6644.16s)]
*  His fucking grappling was elite, man. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6646.639999999999s)]
*  At a certain point in time in his career, he really became an elite grappler. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6649.12s)]
*  I mean, who did the Minotaur brothers gave him his black belt, right? [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6652.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6657.12s)]
*  Didn't they give it to him after he submitted jail? [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6658.5599999999995s)]
*  Or was it before that? [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6660.96s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6661.92s)]
*  I think it was before that. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6662.5599999999995s)]
*  So here he got his back. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6663.68s)]
*  And I think he went to the Dan Severn, right? [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6669.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6673.12s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6673.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6674.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6674.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6675.44s)]
*  Boom. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6676.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6676.639999999999s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6676.96s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6677.5199999999995s)]
*  Right there. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6678.4s)]
*  Boom. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6679.04s)]
*  Boom. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6679.68s)]
*  That's it. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6680.08s)]
*  Brutal. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6680.58s)]
*  Big submission. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6683.84s)]
*  Was he already the champion at this point? [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6684.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6686.8s)]
*  He was defending his title. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6687.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6688.58s)]
*  Shit. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6690.820000000001s)]
*  Dude. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6691.9400000000005s)]
*  So much has happened. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6692.74s)]
*  Do you remember the early days where you and I would go to these events or we'd watch and go, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6693.9400000000005s)]
*  you know what they need? [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6698.66s)]
*  They need some billionaires with some crazy deep pockets to buy the UFC [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6699.860000000001s)]
*  and throw a ton of money at it. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6705.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6706.42s)]
*  And they fucking did it. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6706.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6707.54s)]
*  It actually happened. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6707.78s)]
*  They fucking did it. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6708.9800000000005s)]
*  They really did it. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6709.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6711.22s)]
*  Generally, that's what it takes. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6713.38s)]
*  It takes someone with money to burn that has vision to go, OK, we're going to burn some [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6714.42s)]
*  money right now, but eventually it's going to come back to us a thousandfold. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6720.1s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6724.26s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6725.3s)]
*  Especially when they knew that the product was so good. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6726.58s)]
*  I mean, there was no denying that the UFC was exciting. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6729.46s)]
*  People that are just getting into MMA now, you've got to go back and go through the timeline. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6732.74s)]
*  It was, man, the 90s. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6737.22s)]
*  It blew up. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6739.46s)]
*  UFC 2 blew up. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6740.58s)]
*  No one really knew what UFC 1 was about because there was no B-roll. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6741.86s)]
*  And they're like, I remember thinking, oh, that's some pro wrestling. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6745.46s)]
*  We just didn't know what it was. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6748.099999999999s)]
*  And then you find out it was real. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6749.38s)]
*  And you're like, oh, shit. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6751.299999999999s)]
*  And then the UFC 2 comes along and go, OK, let me watch this shit. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6752.259999999999s)]
*  And it's a 16-man tournament. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6756.42s)]
*  And I was doing karate at the time. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6758.339999999999s)]
*  And I remember watching Hoyce beat Minoki Ichihara. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6760.74s)]
*  And it fucking crushed me. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6763.78s)]
*  I'm like, fuck. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6765.54s)]
*  Who is this Brazilian guy? [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6767.62s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6769.299999999999s)]
*  But by the time he got to the finals, man, I was a big fan. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6769.94s)]
*  I'm like, oh, shit. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6772.42s)]
*  You could take people. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6774.179999999999s)]
*  You could fight on the ground and you're not considered a pussy. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6775.219999999999s)]
*  Because I would fight on the ground because I wrestled in high school. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6777.299999999999s)]
*  And I'm just take a dude down. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6781.0599999999995s)]
*  I remember when I first met you, you would wear the fucking scuba gear on your head [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6782.74s)]
*  because you had long ass hair. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6788.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6789.54s)]
*  She'd wear like scuba gear. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6790.0199999999995s)]
*  And you would close it off with ear guards. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6791.62s)]
*  And you would toe hold everybody. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6793.86s)]
*  I would wear a Jacusto head gear to put all my hair in. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6795.7s)]
*  And then I would put the wrestling ear guards over it just to disguise it. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6802.179999999999s)]
*  Just so it doesn't look like I'm a fucking Jacusto. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6808.26s)]
*  I remember when I first met you, you were leg locking. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6812.58s)]
*  You were toe holding everybody. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6815.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6816.82s)]
*  That was your move. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6817.139999999999s)]
*  From Ken Shamrock. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6818.099999999999s)]
*  I learned it from some instructional video of him in jeans. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6819.22s)]
*  He has no shirt, looking like a Chippendales dancer, jeans on. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6822.66s)]
*  And he's doing a toe hold with some Japanese guy because he was all pan-crazed out. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6826.9s)]
*  And I'm like, whoa. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6832.0199999999995s)]
*  He was doing it from the top. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6833.7s)]
*  And I was always on the bottom playing half guard. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6835.86s)]
*  I'm like, I wonder if I could do it from half guard. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6837.62s)]
*  So I started doing toe holds from half guard a lot. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6838.98s)]
*  Toes are still super powerful in the game. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6841.38s)]
*  Oh yeah, man. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6844.5s)]
*  In today's game, there's some guys that just got that toe hold down. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6845.62s)]
*  They'll break your fucking foot off. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6848.66s)]
*  When Nicky Rod got Gordon in it and popped his ankle, that was nasty. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6849.86s)]
*  Yeah, those things are nasty, man. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6853.94s)]
*  You just got to get really good at it. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6855.62s)]
*  You just got to know how to use your whole body to twist that foot off. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6856.9s)]
*  Also, that'll fuck your ankle up for a long time. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6860.0199999999995s)]
*  I wonder how Gordon's ankle is. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6862.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6864.74s)]
*  That looks nasty. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6865.219999999999s)]
*  He's probably fine. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6865.78s)]
*  I'm sure he's fine. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6866.9s)]
*  Because it just tears that, like, if it pops, it's like the outside of your foot, [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6867.62s)]
*  right under that little ankle ball thing. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6872.74s)]
*  There's this meat under there that's going to be- [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6874.98s)]
*  It's ripped? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6877.62s)]
*  Yeah, and it stays sore for a couple months. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6878.66s)]
*  Is it a- [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6882.26s)]
*  You can get surgery on it. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6883.14s)]
*  You can't? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6884.26s)]
*  Ankle surgery only happens when you break bones, like the ankle bones, [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6888.5s)]
*  all the little ligaments. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6893.3s)]
*  There's so many little ones that you just kind of just leave it alone and just- [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6894.42s)]
*  You know who Laird Hamilton is? [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6897.78s)]
*  No. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6899.38s)]
*  Laird Hamilton's a world champion surfer. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6899.94s)]
*  He's a wild man. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6902.42s)]
*  And he broke his ankle and didn't do shit about it. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6903.78s)]
*  Just sit, fuck it. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6907.0599999999995s)]
*  Just walk around in a broken ankle. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6907.86s)]
*  And his one of his ankles is like twice the size of a regular ankle. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6909.7s)]
*  It just became this like- [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6914.099999999999s)]
*  Calcium deposit- [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6915.94s)]
*  Not a bone. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6916.98s)]
*  That's all. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6918.82s)]
*  Look at his ankle. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6919.459999999999s)]
*  He showed it to me. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6920.099999999999s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6921.299999999999s)]
*  What? [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6921.86s)]
*  That's his ankle. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6922.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6923.379999999999s)]
*  I don't even get what that is, dude. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6925.219999999999s)]
*  I don't even see what that is. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6926.9s)]
*  That's his broken bone. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6927.62s)]
*  That's healed up. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6928.74s)]
*  White shit on the top. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6929.379999999999s)]
*  That's the bottom of his foot. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6930.419999999999s)]
*  So he's got it. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6931.86s)]
*  He's doing this. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6932.5s)]
*  He's like showing me like this. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6933.219999999999s)]

*  It's freaky. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6937.38s)]
*  You look at it and you go, what the fuck? [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6938.58s)]
*  You didn't go to a doctor? [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6940.099999999999s)]
*  He's like, nah, I just walked around. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6941.86s)]
*  He's an animal, dude. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6943.7s)]
*  That guy, he gets in the sauna at 200 degrees, 200 plus, [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6945.219999999999s)]

*  I can't believe people survive those waves. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6968.5s)]
*  They don't always. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6971.38s)]
*  They don't always. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6972.98s)]
*  How often does a surfer die? [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6973.94s)]

*  Yeah, man. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6977.38s)]
*  When those things come crashing down on you, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6977.78s)]
*  you fucking plummet to the bottom with a million pounds of water on top of you, [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6979.62s)]
*  and you get knocked unconscious. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6984.66s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6986.58s)]
*  Guys get driven by the weight of the water right into the rocks. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6988.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6991.54s)]
*  I'm not into that at all. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6991.94s)]
*  I'm not into sharks. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=6994.1s)]

*  My sister sent it to me because it's down near where she lives. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7006.9s)]
*  They fucking found some alligator just dragging a lady. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7010.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7014.66s)]
*  How about that shark in Egypt that attacked that man? [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7015.22s)]
*  Oh, that one's horrible. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7018.02s)]
*  It seems like we're seeing more shark attacks. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7019.06s)]

*  People have better phones. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7022.58s)]
*  That's probably what it is, huh? [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7023.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7024.82s)]
*  That one, we haven't confirmed whether or not this is true, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7025.78s)]
*  but what I had heard was that off the coast of this resort, [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7030.18s)]
*  these people were dumping sheep carcasses. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7034.58s)]
*  They had these sheep carcasses and they wanted to get rid of them, [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7038.26s)]
*  so they dumped them off the coast. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7040.9800000000005s)]
*  That's what they would do with them. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7043.14s)]
*  A high concentration of sharks would happen in that area. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7045.38s)]
*  There's a fucking resort there. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7048.26s)]
*  There's this really nice resort. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7050.82s)]
*  People are like, oh, fucking, let's go for a swim. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7052.1s)]
*  You're going for a swim in monster soup. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7054.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7056.5s)]
*  And they've been feeding those monsters. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7056.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7058.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7059.22s)]
*  I just fucked that dude up. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7059.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7062.18s)]
*  I'm not... [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7062.74s)]
*  There's definitely stories of that happening. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7063.7s)]
*  I don't know if it's the exact same area, but it might be. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7065.46s)]
*  Sheep exports linked to Egypt shark attacks from 2010. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7067.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7071.94s)]
*  So I bet that's... [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7073.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7076.82s)]
*  Why are dead sheep washing up on Egypt shores? [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7077.22s)]
*  That's from 2017. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7079.7s)]
*  So 2010, and then again in 2017. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7080.98s)]
*  Probably. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7085.06s)]
*  Yeah, so similar to what happened in Sharmal. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7085.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7089.54s)]
*  And so it's down there, 2022, [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7089.7s)]
*  animal carcasses dropped to the sea near that place. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7091.7s)]
*  Wow. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7094.9800000000005s)]
*  Travel agent noted that. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7096.34s)]
*  The travel agent. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7098.66s)]
*  How about they give you a heads up? [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7100.18s)]
*  Hey, by the way, they dump a lot of bloody carcasses in that water. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7101.46s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7106.1s)]
*  Sharks. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7106.900000000001s)]
*  Like all you need to do is see jaws. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7107.38s)]
*  And that right there just scares you out the goddamn ocean. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7109.860000000001s)]
*  Did you see the Meg? [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7113.54s)]
*  It might be the dumbest movie of all time. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7115.94s)]
*  And the Meg too is like, hold my beer. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7118.9s)]
*  I watched the Meg too with my daughter. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7121.94s)]
*  They were howling, just howling, laughing. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7124.0199999999995s)]
*  It's so goofy. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7126.0199999999995s)]
*  This shark like tries to find people. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7127.06s)]
*  It works though. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7131.46s)]
*  It works because I will never go deep sea diving ever. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7132.26s)]
*  That's never gonna fucking happen. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7136.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I'm so not into that. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7138.1s)]
*  I ain't going into jungles and I ain't going deep sea diving. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7139.3s)]
*  I ain't doing. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7142.9s)]
*  So not into it. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7143.46s)]
*  No anacondas for me, no crocodiles. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7144.099999999999s)]
*  I'll go to Aspen and go snowboarding. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7147.54s)]
*  That's what I'm gonna do. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7149.54s)]
*  I had Paul Rosalie on my podcast and he's a dude that [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7150.34s)]
*  he spends a large amount of time saving the rainforest. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7153.86s)]
*  Really fucking cool guy. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7157.86s)]
*  He goes down to the Amazon and he's like saving the rainforest [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7159.3s)]
*  from people that are cutting it down. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7162.9s)]
*  And what he does is these loggers are just poor, man. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7165.139999999999s)]
*  You know, they're not trying to destroy the world. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7167.78s)]
*  They don't have options, man. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7169.46s)]
*  You know, they're poor. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7170.98s)]
*  And so what he does is he gets them hired to protect the [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7172.26s)]
*  rainforest. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7175.9400000000005s)]
*  So he gets the same people say, hey, man, this job, what's this job paying you? [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7176.820000000001s)]
*  How about we give you more money and you protect the rainforest? [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7181.22s)]
*  And like, oh, thank you. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7183.9400000000005s)]
*  So he hires these guys to do the opposite of what they were doing. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7186.34s)]
*  And they've protected millions of acres of rainforest just doing this. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7189.62s)]
*  But this dude, he told me he jumped on an anaconda because he was trying to like, [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7193.22s)]
*  they were trying to figure out how big it is. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7199.14s)]
*  He couldn't get his arms around it. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7201.14s)]
*  He's my size. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7203.700000000001s)]
*  He couldn't get his arms around it. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7204.820000000001s)]
*  So he's my size. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7205.780000000001s)]
*  So imagine this. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7206.740000000001s)]
*  Imagine this, a snake that wide. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7208.1s)]
*  He said it was at least 25 feet long and it was slithering through the water. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7211.780000000001s)]
*  And he felt it slither and it's dark out and he tried to hold on to it. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7215.3s)]
*  So he tried to grab a hold of it like this. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7219.3s)]
*  I wish I had that kind of courage. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7221.54s)]
*  I don't know if that's courage. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7223.62s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7224.740000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7225.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7226.5s)]
*  Jungle scared the shit out of me, man. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7227.54s)]
*  I like watching him on TV. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7229.06s)]
*  I like watching Amazon River documentaries and Congo documentaries, [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7230.5s)]
*  but I will never go into another jungle in my life. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7235.22s)]
*  You know what my favorite thing is? [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7238.02s)]
*  When jaguars kill crocodiles. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7240.1s)]
*  That's pretty badass. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7242.66s)]
*  Crocodiles, they deserve it. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7243.62s)]
*  Yeah, they deserve it. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7245.06s)]
*  They think they're the shit. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7245.86s)]
*  They're always sneaking up on antelope, you know, I mean, every now and then [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7246.74s)]
*  when a leopard fucking takes them out, it feels good. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7250.34s)]
*  Cats are number one. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7252.66s)]
*  Cats are number one. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7254.18s)]
*  They're my favorite. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7255.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7256.34s)]
*  Because they're so ruthless. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7256.9s)]
*  This fucking cat swimming through the water, eating crocodiles, [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7258.740000000001s)]
*  and he's got a cro- there's many videos of this happening, [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7261.780000000001s)]
*  people caught them hunting crocodiles. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7264.58s)]
*  But this one, this fucking, this jaguar is carrying a crocodile bigger than him. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7267.14s)]
*  He's got it by the back of its neck and he's waddling out of the water [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7273.9400000000005s)]
*  with this fucking crocodile in his teeth. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7278.5s)]
*  Who would have imagined that something would hunt crocodiles? [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7281.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7284.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you think they'd have no predators. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7285.54s)]
*  The fucking cats in the Amazon, man, they're so big. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7287.7s)]
*  Those jaguars are big, bro. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7290.5s)]
*  They're big and they're so ruthless. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7292.5s)]
*  He said he was sleeping in a hammock and a jaguar came right up to his hammock [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7294.98s)]
*  and was like breathing in the hammock. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7300.099999999999s)]
*  Dude, that's so good. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7305.46s)]
*  Right there. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7307.22s)]
*  Right outside the hammock. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7308.34s)]
*  Dude, you got a good ass fucking lion or tiger. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7308.74s)]
*  Yeah, I'm fascinated by cats. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7314.58s)]
*  I think that's the scariest way to die. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7316.34s)]
*  Tigers are the scariest way. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7318.1s)]
*  You've seen that one where the tiger leaps up and tries to get that guy [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7320.5s)]
*  where he's on top of the elephant. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7323.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7324.26s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7325.860000000001s)]
*  It's a classic. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7326.34s)]
*  Tigers, fuck out of here. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7326.900000000001s)]
*  The fuck out of here, man. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7329.3s)]
*  Unless you have a fucking machine gun. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7331.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7333.3s)]
*  And he's like, you can't have a stick. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7333.7s)]
*  He's trying to get it off with a stick. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7337.22s)]

*  to kill these crocodiles because these people in this village were getting [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7407.46s)]
*  fucked up by crocodiles so much. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7410.58s)]
*  And what these people would do is they would set up these areas [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7412.9s)]
*  where it was okay for them to wash and to gather water. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7416.259999999999s)]

*  like sticks in the water in the ground so that the crocodiles couldn't get through, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7424.74s)]
*  but they'd still figure out a way to get through. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7428.5s)]
*  They knew it. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7430.1s)]

*  That makes sense because it's probably a recessive gene, right? [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7573.86s)]
*  Could you breed them or is it just like something that just pops up every now and then? [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=7576.98s)]

*  Remember Johnny Cash? [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8247.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8248.66s)]
*  Wait wait wait Johnny Cash which was... [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8249.140000000001s)]
*  The giant mastiff? [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8250.74s)]
*  The mastiff. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8252.18s)]
*  Oh yes. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8252.66s)]
*  Yes. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8253.060000000001s)]
*  So we had chickens right and chickens they brood and what a brood is it's like sometimes chickens [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8253.78s)]
*  when there's no rooster they're convinced like chickens lay eggs every day pretty much [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8259.94s)]
*  and they don't turn into chicks because there's no rooster to fertilize the egg right. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8265.060000000001s)]
*  Rooster fucks the hen the hen lays an egg that egg's viable becomes a chick. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8271.06s)]
*  But chicks the chickens don't know that so sometimes they get it in their head that this [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8275.380000000001s)]
*  this egg is going to be a baby and so they pluck their own feathers out and they sit on this egg [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8280.26s)]
*  if you come near them they peck at you and they're brooding and they won't lay an egg for a long time [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8285.78s)]
*  and to get them out of the brooding what you have to do is you have to take them from their big [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8290.58s)]
*  chicken coop and then you have to put them in a small chicken coop where they have to hold onto [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8294.02s)]
*  a railing so they they can't sit down on the ground and brood and there's no egg in there [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8299.3s)]
*  so they have to sit on this railing hold if you keep them there for a few days they snap out of it [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8303.939999999999s)]
*  then you put them back in the chicken coop. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8307.699999999999s)]
*  Well this fucking coyote was so smart that it became friends with Johnny and Johnny was like [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8309.939999999999s)]

*  the small chicken coop that you would put the brooders in and so somehow or another this coyote [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8329.94s)]
*  became friends with Johnny and the pool guy fucked up and he left the gate open so the gate was open [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8336.9s)]
*  to where the chicken coop was and the coyote convinced Johnny to destroy this little chicken [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8344.26s)]
*  coop and so like he couldn't do it he was too little the coyote is like 30 pounds but Johnny's [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8351.38s)]

*  this coyote was his friend and so I'm sitting there we're playing some kind of game I forget [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=8362.019999999999s)]

*  his um whole system is my back the pain i'm getting is my lower back muscles are locked [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=9243.14s)]

*  get in there and start throwing elbows and fucking yanking and stretching because that does nothing [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=9282.9s)]
*  that just makes it worse you got to do a slow stretch you do and it's it's you can't there can't [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=9287.54s)]

*  you should look into this first it's it's that sounds amazing and the crazy thing is the the [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=9436.5s)]
*  stretching there's there's not supposed to be any pain so there is no pain everything has to be as [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=9441.3s)]

*  you don't just nuke it right it's you got to do it slowly you so the the basic um philosophy behind [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=9456.9s)]
*  it is you stretch the muscle it stretches just a little bit and then you rest for a minute don't [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=9464.42s)]
*  do nothing you don't move and you lay on your back it's called the dead zone and then it just it feels [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=9468.66s)]

*  stretch it a little bit more and then you rest for one minute don't do nothing dead zone and then [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=9478.5s)]
*  it fills with blood a little bit more and a little it's a slow and it's an hour and a half slow about [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=9482.74s)]
*  an hour and a half so you do it every day i tried to if i'm on the road it's tough but you can just [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEZ414cngfo&t=9487.78s)]
