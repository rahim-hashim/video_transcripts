# Joe Rogan Experience #2207 - Shawn Ryan
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcgC532OPhw)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Train by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day!
*  How's it going?
*  How's it going? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
*  I really enjoy your show. It's very different.
*  Like when I first started watching it, I was like,
*  Oh, this guy's fucking interviewing all kinds of crazy people.
*  I like you like a Navy SEAL Art Bell.
*  It's kind of cool, man.
*  You know, like you go out there with people,
*  like that one dude that was saying there's direct energy weapons in Antarctica.
*  You letting that guy go out. He's going out on a long ass pier.
*  Oh yeah. Eric Hacker.
*  All those stories are so crazy. I was just finishing, is it John Alexander?
*  Yeah. Is that the gentleman?
*  That worked with like UAPs and unidentified phenomenon and mysteries.
*  He's done it all. He's done it all. Fascinating.
*  All the way back to Vietnam, right? Yeah. Yeah.
*  That guy. What a crazy story, man.
*  Imagine being involved in that kind of shit.
*  I don't know. How much do you believe it though?
*  Like it's like when I hear the UFO stuff, there's a part of my brain that's like,
*  Don't get suckered into this. This shit's nonsense.
*  There's something that it just feels like something like if they told me a super volcano was going to erupt,
*  I would believe it because super volcanoes are definitely real and there's a historical precedent.
*  They've ruined civilizations.
*  They tell me that there's UFOs and part of me is just like, I don't fucking believe you.
*  Yeah. You know what I mean?
*  Yeah. I know. You know, I mean,
*  you know what bothers me about the whole camp is nobody,
*  none of these camps like talk to each other. Right.
*  It's my camp knows everything. Isn't that always the case though?
*  Yes. In the military often. Oh, yeah. I was going to compare it to special officer.
*  That guy doesn't know shit. I know. You know, that's that's kind of how when I was really young,
*  I was like 24. I was dating this girl that was she did something in government and she was explaining to me.
*  So this is pre internet ish. You know, like people didn't have the Internet then.
*  It's like early nineties. Right.
*  And she said that she she one of her jobs was to make sure that information that the Navy had received would be available to the Army.
*  So like you have to make sure people aren't running redundant tests like we already did this.
*  We'll get you this information. So there was like some sort of a database in like these computer terminals where she could share information.
*  And she had some sort of top clearance.
*  And one day, like just fucking around, she wrote little green men in the search function and her computer got shut down.
*  And then people visited her and they asked her, like, what are you doing?
*  Like, why did you why did you look this up? Like, what is this all about?
*  And I think she wound up either getting fired or transferred to some other position or lost whatever clearance that she had.
*  Interesting. But I've not heard that one.
*  When I was young, I was like, wow, aliens are real.
*  But as an older man now looking back on it, maybe what she was doing was inappropriate for her job.
*  Like maybe what she was doing was demonstrating that she couldn't be trusted because she's doing something that's not there was no request to look up little green men.
*  Yeah, it was like she she did it on her own.
*  Is this 100 percent factual?
*  Hard to tell. You know, it's just because it was a girl I dated.
*  I don't I don't really know. Oh, you dated her.
*  Yeah, I dated her. Yeah.
*  This is yeah. Like like I said, early 90s, I was living in New York.
*  I had actually dated her in Boston and we met up again in New York a couple of years later.
*  So she was telling me about her job and she was telling me, like, check this out.
*  I shouldn't be telling you this, but part of it back then I was all in on UFOs.
*  I was like, wow, UFO is real.
*  But as an older man, I look back and go, well, if you have some kid, you know, she was basically my age, she's probably 24 as well.
*  And you're having this kid work in these terminals that has access to top secret information and they have clearance.
*  I would say, hey, maybe you shouldn't be just looking up shit randomly.
*  Yeah. You know, like we can't have this kid. We can't trust this kid.
*  You know, it doesn't seem like everything's so compartmentalized in government and especially at that kind of classified whatever security clearance level.
*  I mean, there's whatever. I didn't get that high up.
*  But I've not seen like a database where you can just look anything up like, oh, shit, who killed who killed up JFK?
*  Right. Let's look that up real quick. You know, it's it's it's.
*  Well, you know what Trump said about that one, right? What did he say?
*  Trump said that if they showed you what they showed me, you wouldn't want to release it either.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did hear that.
*  Crazy. What a crazy thing to say. Yeah.
*  That can only mean one thing in my eyes. We did it. Yeah.
*  The only the only thing that makes any sense is the United States did it.
*  I mean, more and more just keeps unraveling.
*  Tucker just comes out and says it openly. He just says it openly. Yeah. CIA killed Kennedy.
*  He has a crazy laugh.
*  I don't you know, I don't know who could actually say it other than the people that have read those papers.
*  You know, who knows what they would.
*  You know, the president is basically a part time employee, not a part time employee, but part a short term employee.
*  You know, if you've got a long run in business and for some technicality every now and then you have to bring in some fucking CEO.
*  He does a four year term and then hopefully he could finagle it so he gets another four year term if he's playing by the rules and you just bring him in.
*  And you bring it. Yeah. Why would you tell that guy who killed Kennedy? Yeah. Yeah.
*  They hid shit from him all the time, which is totally illegal.
*  What do you what do you think about RF case, you know, possibly getting in to investigate all that?
*  I think it would be one of the best things for the health of the people in the United States.
*  If you really care about health, I think there's a lot of us and it was me at one point in time and I've gotten more educated about it.
*  A lot of us are very ignorant about what we're doing to our bodies with food and with medications.
*  And I don't think we're being told the truth.
*  And I think there's a reason why other countries, multiple other countries have banned food elements, food like ingredients that we use all the time.
*  These red dyes, all these different and this was all there was just a recent thing that they did.
*  Who was involved in that? Brigham testified in that. Yeah.
*  This episode is brought to you by the Farmers Dog. Dogs are amazing.

*  They had all these health experts testify and they were all hammering this point over and over again.
*  They were talking about the food additives. They were talking about glyphosate and how fucking dangerous glyphosate is.
*  And like an enormous percentage of people show traces of glyphosate in their blood.
*  We're getting it through all kinds of vegetables. It's ubiquitously sprayed on monocrop agriculture crops.
*  We're all just consuming these poisons. There's no reason to have fluoride in the water.
*  There's fucking no reason. We've been putting fluoride in the water. Keep your teeth closed. You don't want cavities.
*  It doesn't make any sense. And we've been doing it forever.
*  And there's no reason to do it. And there's like real data that shows that high levels of fluoride in water lowers IQ.
*  The higher the fluoride is in water in certain areas, they can see a measurable dip in people's IQs.
*  Wow. I didn't know that. Have you messed around with the... have you heard of the Yuca app?
*  No.
*  Dude, you got to get the Yuca app.
*  What is it?
*  So you basically scan anything like food related.
*  It's Y-U-K-A.
*  So, deodorant. I think it's Y-U-C-A.
*  There it is.
*  Nice.
*  There it is.
*  Y-U-K-A. Shout out to Yuca.
*  There it is. See, like honey nut. So it'll tell you the additives in there.
*  It contains additives to avoid sugar to sugar.
*  It'll tell you all the chemicals and what the chemicals do to you.
*  Ah, that's genius.
*  Yeah, it's pretty...
*  What a great ad. No ads. We just did an ad for them.
*  Good for them though, but that's what people need.
*  I think if RFK gets into office, he will expose a lot of this stuff, just like he did when he was an environmental attorney.
*  You know, people think of him as just the vaccine kook. Listen, you got to look at that guy's...
*  The history of that guy's work has all been about protecting people from corporations that are poisoning them.
*  That's literally what that guy did his whole career.
*  And if he can do that with health, particularly with things that we can avoid.
*  Look, one of the things they demonstrated is that Lucky Charms, as sold in the United States, they don't sell the same one in Canada.
*  In Canada, the dyes that we use to make it all pretty and exciting for kids, they don't allow that because it's fucking toxic.
*  So we allow it, which means someone's corrupt. Someone's corrupt.
*  Probably the whole system, maybe.
*  Probably the whole system is heavily influenced. At the very least, forget about bribery. Let's not even say bribery.
*  Heavily influenced by relationships that these people have with CEOs in these corporations and the boards of executives.
*  And this weird little revolving door between the FDA and the CDC and all these different organizations.
*  And then they get to leave and then they get this amazing job working for some huge corporation that they were helping regulate just a few years ago.
*  It's the most transparent thing. It should be if insider trading is illegal. How's that legal?
*  Good point. I mean, does FDA approval even mean anything to you?
*  Not to me. It doesn't to me. But it took a long time before I got to that.
*  It took a long time before I really understood why do we think saturated fat is bad. Oh, it was a lie by the sugar companies.
*  Why do people tell you that vitamin supplementation doesn't really help and you just need a balanced diet?
*  Oh, because doctors don't know jack shit about nutrition. And you're going to a guy who literally knows less than you
*  because he went to medical school for how to fix knees or whatever the fuck he specialized in.
*  You're taking this guy's advice and he doesn't know anything about nutrition. He's not read any peer review data.
*  That guy's just trying to keep up. He's got fucking bills piling in and he's bringing people and shuffling them through the office.
*  And he's worried about his. You have insurance in case you fuck up malpractice insurance and you have to pay your medical school bills.
*  And those guys are barely getting but they're floating. They're trying to just run people through their office as fast as they can.
*  Does it does it bother you if there's some type, I don't know, some type of a new does it bother you if it's not FDA approved at all?
*  If it's new, like nobody's looked into it. Well, I wouldn't take anything. No one's looked, especially a drug.
*  Yeah, it's just like, give it some time kids. Give it some time.
*  I mean, how many times do they have to pull drugs before people like what is the percentage of drugs that the FDA approves and then pulls?
*  I believe it's 25 percent is I have no idea. I think it's 25 percent. See if that's true.
*  So this is the ones that they approve. And then eventually they find other stuff is terrible for you.
*  And then they pull it. Yeah, I think it's 25 percent, which, you know, was it say one third?
*  Oh, shit. One third. I was off.
*  According to the 2017 study, which is probably worse now about one third of drugs approved by the FDA within a 10 year period receive alerts, warnings or recalls in the years following their approval.
*  That's fucking bananas. Give it some time, kids.
*  Yeah. Also, have you seen the Steven Crowder undercover thing he did with that covid czar in New York?
*  No. Have you seen that? Jamie, go to his page and find the most recent one, because the most recent one is fascinating because the most recent one,
*  this guy is openly talking about how monkeypox is not really a threat, but they're trying to present it as a threat so they can sell this medication.
*  Interesting. They're talking about pushing this. This guy's openly talking about monkeypox is really just gay guys get it from unprotected.
*  But let's let it be. Yeah, I said it on his Instagram. Go to it. I'll show you which one it is.
*  Yeah, that's it. Is it? No, no, no, no, no. That's not it. That's not it. That's because that's the one where he's talking about how he shut the city down.
*  There's a recent one. No, I know. Maybe it's somewhere else. Let me scroll down a little bit.
*  See if you can find the one. See that one right there. That's that kind of that's kind of yellow. It's yellow there.
*  But which one? There's got to be one where he's talking about monkeypox.
*  Because that was the one I was watching today.
*  That's that's not because that's all about shutting the schools down.
*  God damn it. We've got to find it. OK, just find it and get to us because I know we I might have watched it on X.
*  I probably thought I'm saying X now.
*  Like when I call a transgender person a girl, she like, you like that?
*  I said she. And so I was talking to him directly.
*  No, no, that's not it. That's that's Crowder confronting him when he's that guy's fired now.
*  That guy's fucked. But the monkeypox one. God damn it.
*  I know I saved it. If you want, I can find it.
*  I saved it on my phone because I was like, this is just so bonkers.
*  And openly admitting that they're trying to push people into taking drugs.
*  It doesn't even work. Really interesting.
*  This is going to be a problem. I'm not going to find it.
*  If you just see if you could find it, it's got to be out there because I watched this.
*  I'm not going to find it. I'm not going to find it.
*  I'm not going to find it. I'm not going to find it.
*  I'm not going to find it. I'm not going to find it.
*  It's got to be out there because I watched it this morning.
*  Did you go monkeypox? Nothing.
*  It's going to be in one of these links. I just have to take a second.
*  Oh, wait a hold on. Back up. Back up. That was right there.
*  Right above that, Dr. J Varna. OK, this is it.
*  It's not the same thing as last one. It's not.
*  Oh, so is it because the New York Post doesn't show it?
*  That's OK. We could just read what it says because it's kind of interesting.
*  We don't have to hear him say it. But Stephen Crowder's kind of decided to do this James O'Keefe type deal.
*  And I don't know how they do that. It's pretty wizardry. Yeah.
*  You know, generally, I think you get like a gay guy who likes to talk.
*  And some handsome dude who can sit down with this guy and get him a little tipsy.
*  That seems to be habit. Gay guys like to spill the beans.
*  He previously served senior health advisor to then mayor Bill de Blasio.
*  Well, tasked with running Big Apple's pandemic response.
*  OK, so he was talking about the approval process while discussing SIGA technologies.
*  Technoviravirabant or T pox drug.
*  So this is the drug for monkey pox. So that's why spinning it in the media is helpful.
*  We want the FDA to approve our drug specifically for monkey pox.
*  And right now it's only considered experimental and they won't approve it.
*  He said in the US T pox is not approved by the FDA for treatment of M pox,
*  but can be used to treat patients as part of a clinical trial known as the study of
*  Technoviramant for human M pox virus, according to SIGA technologies.
*  The company's website added that the stump trial is being conducted to evaluate the
*  efficacy of T pox for the treatment of M pox.
*  Varna then griped at the video filmed on August 14th that his then employer is stuck with our drug.
*  But the people aren't going to be as confident in it because the data doesn't look as strong as it should.
*  And so then later he starts talking about the stock prices.
*  So he says sometimes you do a study and this fucking nothing works at all or people get really sick from it.
*  He said in the covert recording, the problem is if you do another study, it'll take a year or two to do it
*  because you have to get the ethics approval. You got to get the money.
*  You got to get the patients to come in.
*  In the videos, Varna then gloated about how he knows the reporters well and referenced a September interview
*  with New York Times on M pox, which touted the T pox as a drug used to treat M pox infection.
*  He also described the World Health Organization's emergency authorization process before explaining how he wants the media to report on T pox.
*  So he was talking one of the things in the video he was talking about stock prices.
*  So they're talking about making it look like these drugs do better than they do, getting people to prescribe them.
*  OK, hold on. OK. So basically we're trying to get the media to say is, oh, the drug didn't work because it was designed the wrong way.
*  So they're going to do another study and it'll probably work.
*  And in the meantime, people just prescribe it as an emergency drug.
*  That's what we want the story to be, which is wild to say out loud.
*  And he said the risk of M pox spreading in the U.S. is very low and it's almost certainly going to stay among gay men.
*  Yeah. So it's all just. It's supposedly.
*  Only like I don't think in America, I think four people have died from it, which is you got to go hard.
*  That's it. I go hard and die from that.
*  You quit right before they talked about the 10 person sex parties.
*  Oh, yeah, that was that was another thing.
*  That was when he got busted for having parties during the covid lockdowns while he was encouraging the lockdowns.
*  Wow. You didn't hear that part? No.
*  Oh, so he got crowded, got him on camera saying that he was doing Molly and partying and saying, I hope somebody doesn't see me doing this because I could get in real trouble because, you know, obviously I.
*  I. Reinforce the lockdowns.
*  I mean, surprising, but not, you know, boy, everybody's eyes have been opened up over the last few years.
*  At least people that are trying to pay attention to how nutty the people are actually run the show.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's a lot of people are.
*  I mean, it's crazy. It's like everything you knew is just flipped upside down.
*  It's like a bunch of actors are running it. That's what it's like, because that's what they're really like.
*  What politicians are like are like actors are not quite good looking enough to get into movies and television shows.
*  They can't host entertainment tonight, but they can read off a teleprompter, you know, and they can do a good.
*  Like, look, Kamala Harris had one good read off a teleprompter and she shot up in the polls.
*  That's the power of just a performance when you want to believe something you want to believe.
*  I mean, I don't believe anything anymore.
*  You know, well, I can't. I was watching this.
*  These guys were breaking down, you know, they can track cell phones, they can figure out like whose cell phone was there.
*  They can get metadata. And they were talking about these Kamala Harris rallies, about how organized they are.
*  These people are coming in on buses and many of them have been to multiple rallies.
*  And that when this one this one local one, like 80 percent of the people came from somewhere else and they were all bused in.
*  How do they know that? How do they know that?
*  Well, I'll send this to Jamie because this one I actually have.
*  But I think they know it because of the data. You could track data on a phone now.
*  Oh, they're doing the geofencing stuff.
*  I don't know exactly how they do it, but they're doing something in which they can tell when when your phone has been in an area.
*  OK, I found this guy's I found I found his the other video.
*  Yeah, here I'll show it to you, Jamie, because it's even gross.
*  You're hearing it come out of this guy's mouth.
*  This is an hour and a half video on his YouTube channel that I think it's taken.
*  Yeah, but this is the clip. I'm sending you the clip from Instagram for whatever.
*  I don't know if Instagram is hiding it. I don't know what's happening, but they wouldn't do that.
*  No, it's on his Lauder with Crowder page. That's why.
*  Oh, is that what it is? Yeah. OK.
*  God, I hate looking up things on my phone in the middle of a fucking show, but sometimes you have to.
*  So these guys, what what they were what they were essentially what they were showing is that here it is that people it's very organized and people are being busted.
*  And, you know, is that OK? Is that ethical? I mean, maybe just making it more convenient for them to go to the Kamlo Harris rally.
*  Nothing wrong with that. Yeah.
*  But if you are organizing crowds like, say, if you do a game show, like if you host a game show, you know, Wheel of Fortune.
*  Wheel of Fortune. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Those people are all paid.
*  Most of them or sometimes you let fans do it for like a very popular show.
*  But I have personally been on a lot of shows where the audience is paid.
*  So it's it's basically like like if you're filming a sitcom, you can and nobody knows what the sitcom is.
*  There's a company that you can hire and you pay the audience to come in and the people cheer.
*  They have an applause sign. Everybody cheers.
*  And you laugh when you tell them to laugh like there's a guy in the audience that's like doing this to them that the people at home don't see.
*  So it's just it's all theater. Right. So they could do that same strategy for a political rally.
*  Yeah. Easily. If you're talking about all the money that you're going to be in control of when you are the president of the United States,
*  which is a spectacular position, not just that, but then all the money you're going to make in appearances and ever forever.
*  Right. You're going to do Goldman Sachs talks and make a half a million dollars for no apparent reason.
*  There's so much money involved. You don't think you would pay audiences to come and cheer.
*  That's cheap. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I don't do you think that's immoral?
*  Well, I think we have like very loose rules on what you're allowed to do and what you're not allowed to do.
*  Like there was a lot of outrage because people were saying that ABC somehow or another had gotten the subject matter to Kamala
*  and that they had agreed to Kamala that they were not going to ask her about her political her record when she was in California
*  and that they were not going to talk about some other person she was involved with that might be in trouble.
*  And they weren't weren't going to fact check her. And then they said they were only going to fact check Donald Trump.
*  Yeah. Which is what led to her saying quite a few things that weren't true.
*  And no one said anything about it, particularly about troops being deployed overseas. Yeah.
*  Do you see that video where the troops are like, what the fuck are you talking about?
*  I got a really good really good front of mine that's deployed in overseas right now.
*  And the Kaaba Harris and yes, sniping bad guys over in Africa.
*  Yeah. How mad would he be if he heard that? I've been there pissed.
*  You are not in a war zone. They're pissed. They should be pissed.
*  So this is from an Instagram account. I don't know what podcast this clip came from, but let's just play it.
*  Rally five thousand and three mobile devices at Kamala Harris's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday afternoon.
*  It appears over thirty six hundred came from Georgia, mainly Atlanta, Georgia, and approximately seven hundred and twenty from Savannah, Georgia.
*  So that's a North Carolina rally with almost 80 percent of the attendees being from Georgia.
*  After you do the math, that's only six hundred or so local people from North Carolina that attended.
*  That's all who shows up and you're planning to what? Get 80 something million votes again.
*  Something ain't right. And then all these people come from buses.
*  And it's kind of weird because at the Trump events, you don't really have like organized buses like that.
*  People just kind of show up and park on their own.
*  But the Kamala rally, there's just these lines of buses at every event, which is weird.
*  And a lot of the people are also the same people that attend multiple rallies.
*  Can you read those tweets? Any of the same ones from previous events?
*  Because this guy's tracking the cell phones, I guess.
*  And he says 90 percent have been to three plus rallies.
*  Fifty four percent were even at Arizona and Nevada.
*  Now, it could be that she is so popular that it's like Swifties.
*  They just follow her around or it could be like, you know, the Grateful Dead was in the 1970s.
*  Maybe maybe that's what's going on. Maybe she's just so amazing.
*  All of a sudden, maybe she just Stella got her groove.
*  Something happened and she just kicked into gear.
*  And now she's her best self. Yeah.
*  Her best self. She's going to be the president.
*  Yay. Let's go to these rallies. I'm sure that's what's going on.
*  Could be that it could be that.
*  I don't think it's really immoral. I mean, it's just immoral.
*  It's just a rally. Well, everybody wants their rally to be full.
*  I mean, you know, it's just I don't it's a facade.
*  It's just a facade. Yeah. If you can do it for a game show, you can do it for a political event.
*  I don't think it's immoral. I think if they did give her the questions and they really did.
*  And this is someone signed an affidavit. See what's going on with that.
*  So what's what's the latest with that, Jamie?
*  So someone signed an affidavit that was an ABC employee that claims these things.
*  And it was very clear there was bias.
*  It was very clear that they were fact checking him and not fact checking her.
*  But it was, you know, unfortunately, he doesn't do himself any favors because he kind of goes off the rail sometimes.
*  They're eating dogs. They're eating cats, which, by the way, they may very well be doing that.
*  That's that's a thing they do in Haiti sometimes.
*  Sometimes they sacrifice animals and, you know, they have local rituals, religious rituals that they do.
*  I mean, this has been going on for a long time, though.
*  You know, sometimes the Kung Pao chicken is a chicken. Right.
*  I mean, that's a real thing. That's a real thing.
*  And to try to pretend that it's racist to say that no, no, no.
*  Humans sometimes will do things.
*  According to this, it says that this started with a claim that there was an affidavit.
*  But I don't know that it's ever been actually presented to anyone.
*  Interesting. Didn't didn't it get discussed on Twitter and people were posting about the veracity of it?
*  Who I think Elon even put it on his post. Who's now?
*  Colin Rugg, I know, had it on his.
*  Yeah. I think it's probably going to be hard to tell when charged.
*  Congress, but it doesn't say that it was said it made it to Congress.
*  They talked about Bill Acmey.
*  That's right. Bill Acmey was a guy who tweeted it.
*  He didn't know if the claim was accurate, but shared it anyway, which is what's fun.
*  It's fun to do on the Internet.
*  Vance addressed the supposed whistleblowers allegations with reporters saying it should be a national scandal if true.
*  Trump again mentioned the whistleblower September 13th at a rally in Las Vegas, claiming that Harris had received the debate questions in advance.
*  Fortunately, we had a leaker or whistleblower. I don't care which. I love that person.
*  The way he talks is such a Trump statement.
*  Representative Dan Mouser, in a Pennsylvania Senate Fox News interview, that he would try to bring in ABC News and the whistleblower before Congress to testify about the affidavit.
*  They said that the person who did it was killed in a car crash, and that seems to be false.
*  Yeah, that was amplified by Marjorie Taylor Greene, who also doesn't do herself any favors.
*  I think they do stuff like that. This is my take on that.
*  When I saw all these people tweeting that the guy died in a car crash, I was like, that might be a trap.
*  That one might be a trap. I think they do stuff like that.
*  Well, they'll throw out a fake story and get people to share it without looking into it at all.
*  And it turns out to be complete horse shit. And it makes the whole thing look like horse shit now.
*  Now it looks like the makes the affidavit. It's at least connected to horse shit.
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? I mean, it's a good tactic. Yeah. Smart tactic.
*  They get a lot of good tactics. They're very organized, which is really interesting.
*  And that's one of the things about Trump is that he's so dominant and he's so swing from the hip that no one can kind of corral him.
*  You know, and it seems like she's really open to being coached.
*  Like some of these speeches are very different than any speeches she's ever given before.
*  And you see the difference between that and then like, do you see the Oprah interview? No.
*  She's off the rails. Yeah, I heard about it.
*  Into fucking wine mom country again. Wow. Tim Dillon is the best. Tim Dillon is like, she's saying gypsy curses.
*  What is she saying? Oh, man.
*  It's like when you get her off the rails and she is, it's kind of fucked up, right?
*  Because that's not the job. The job is not being able to sound cool in an interview with Oprah.
*  That's not the job. But that's the most important part about getting the job.
*  I just want to hear like, you know, how they're going to accomplish all this stuff.
*  Well, they're going to do it once they get in, even though they're already in.
*  That's that's the that seems to be the typical response, right?
*  Well, one thing that you can see like really clearly is there is a ferocious effort to stop Donald Trump from becoming president again that I've never seen before.
*  I've never seen. I've seen tight races. I've seen people very divided.
*  You know, I've seen it for years.
*  There's always been like a division between the Republicans and Democrats in this country, but not like this.
*  Not like this, where the guy almost gets killed twice and they don't even talk about it.
*  It's scary, man. It's nuts.
*  It's scary. Almost gets killed twice in the second one.
*  They just brushed it off like I don't even think the guy got a shot off.
*  Yeah, the guy was set up at a golf course for 12 hours with a bulletproof vest on an AK 47 and was specifically there to kill Trump.
*  You don't think that's crazy? I think it's crazy.
*  They didn't cover it. I mean, it barely got covered.
*  Barely, barely in and out. And then the brother of the guy or the guy's son gets arrested for child pornography.
*  Do you know, have you looked into the Black Rock commercial stuff at all? Is that real?
*  The one shooter was in the Black Rock commercial. That was the kid that tried to kill Trump.
*  Yeah, they said that this guy was in a Black Rock commercial, but I heard that that's not true.
*  It's bullshit. But that could be another one that they just throw out there.
*  You throw one out there like that and then people retweet it and those people look stupid because you retweeted something dumb.
*  And then it just it weakens the public's faith in what you have to say about things and also makes the story look stupid.
*  Like that story about that whistleblower will forever be connected to people retweeting the fact that he died in a car accident, even though he didn't die in a car accident.
*  So it's always going to be shrouded in bullshit. Yeah. Kind of genius.
*  It is, man. It's a great way to discredit.
*  Yeah, it's a great way to get somebody elected.
*  Good point.
*  It's just it's when you're seeing the manipulation just in full bloom, just marching down the street in front of everybody and no one's freaking out about it.
*  That's what's really weird.
*  What do you think? I mean, have you thought about who's behind all this? These assassination attempts?
*  You think they're lone wolves or? Well, was it Matt Gates that was saying that he's been informed that there's five different kill teams looking for Trump in the country right now?
*  Somebody did just say that. Two of them are domestic.
*  Trump said it.
*  There's five guys.
*  They think they're going to get me. They're not going to get me.
*  So is the quote big threats on my life by Iran.
*  The U.S. military is watching and waiting moves already been made by Iran that didn't work out, but they will try again.
*  Not a good situation for anyone.
*  I'm surrounded by more men, guns and weapons than I have ever seen before.
*  Thank you to Congress for unanimously approving far more money to Secret Service.
*  Zero no votes.
*  What zero no votes strictly bipartisan.
*  OK, I understand zero no votes like no one voted against it.
*  Strictly bipartisan. Nice to see Republicans and Democrats get together on something.
*  An attack on a former president is a death wish for the attacker.
*  It wasn't just him that was saying that, though.
*  It was I'm pretty sure it was Matt Gates.
*  I know I have that saved, too, if you want to.
*  But so if there really are five different kill teams in in the country looking for Trump right now, that's just insane.
*  I bet it should be hard to find him.
*  You know, he has rallies, you know, giant rallies.
*  Yeah. In New York, there was 60,000 people.
*  That's insane. So that's the difference between the Kamala Harris rallies.
*  If that guy's telling the truth, if that guy's telling the truth and they really are just sort of manipulating this and putting on theater,
*  that's a big difference between what's happening with Trump.
*  Yeah. If he's he got organically, you got 60,000 people to come see him and freak out in New York.
*  It's kind of the media is a monster. It really is.
*  It is a it's a it's such an obvious monster, such a deceptive, sneaky, propagandist monster.
*  It's it's how long do you think the media has left?
*  They'll be around. You think so?
*  It all depends on who gets into office, really.
*  It depends on. So the real fear was when they started getting their claws into Twitter.
*  The real fear was when the government started suppressing accurate information and Twitter let them do it.
*  That's that was scary close.
*  So Elon buys Twitter, releases the Twitter files, Michael Schellenberger, Matt Taibbi and all those journalists.
*  They all uncover all these different aspects that's super disturbing and totally illegal.
*  And they release everything. And then Twitter becomes kind of crazy.
*  Like Twitter is wild now. Like there's it's just totally wild, wild west, unregulated.
*  And then we got Jamie. This is it.
*  OK, one of the five known teams hunting President Trump for Butler, Pennsylvania, attempt was Ukrainian.
*  So this is Matt Gates talking about this. But I think that if that hadn't happened.
*  So if all of social media remained like staunch leftist left wing,
*  just giving completely into whatever propaganda the government wants to give them regarding vaccines or Ukraine or anything else with no critical arguments about it that are accepted.
*  They just anybody who doesn't follow the narrative, especially people like, you know, they they censored people from Stanford and MIT.
*  They put they were trying to tell them to pull those guy like Jay Bhattacharya.
*  Are you doctors about covid? Yeah, oh yeah, I did. I did.
*  Censoring like legitimate experts in the field who aren't kooks, guys like Peter McCullough, who's the most published doctor in his field of study in human history.
*  And they're like, no, no, you're a kook. You're a kook.
*  And we know now that that was not true. And he was correct. Now we all know.
*  All these years later, most people kind of know what the fuck happened.
*  Even the people reluctant to admit they got duped. Yeah.
*  If they if Elon does not come along and buy Twitter, I don't know where we are right now.
*  I really don't, because they had the clamps on Twitter and they did the same thing with Twitter that they're doing right now with other social media apps.
*  It would be fucking awful out there. I know, man. It's Elon's been a blessing.
*  He really has. You know, it's a it's a big one.
*  I mean, I don't I don't think they're going to be around that much longer.
*  I feel like that the media will die with the baby boomer generation.
*  I think if Elon didn't buy Twitter, they would have been fine. I really do. Probably.
*  The only thing that fucks them up is YouTube, but they've got a clamp on YouTube, too.
*  You know, YouTube is they're very restrictive in what you can talk about, especially during the pandemic.
*  They would ban you from YouTube for talking about things that we know for a fact are true now.
*  It's we deal with a lot of that. We deal with a lot of it, right?
*  I'll bet you did, too. Oh, yeah. Anybody on YouTube.
*  I mean, you have to like parse your words, you know, like Jimmy Dore, even when he's criticizing the vaccine, he said, but you should take the vaccine because it's safe and effective.
*  Yeah. He always has to say it like to cover his ass.
*  Was it nice for you to come off YouTube? Did you and did you enjoy that when it first happened?
*  My strategy was no, I don't pay attention to it.
*  But my strategy was to become 10 percent less famous.
*  So when I went over to Spotify, Spotify was going to give me all this money and I was like, oh, great.
*  Just fucking be a little less famous, too. That'd be good.
*  Like kind of like go the Howard Stern route, kind of fade off into the sunset. Yeah.
*  Did it work? No, it didn't work.
*  I was going to get caught up in this massive controversy, you know, but it also even back even after before that, this podcast was growing on Spotify a little too quick.
*  But so there's no like extra pressure being on YouTube.
*  But there is a pressure if you're relying on YouTube, if you're like, I guess I meant was they'll demonetize you.
*  That's what I meant. I met with like the censorship stuff. I was wondering, you know, when you're something interesting.
*  Yeah, we got demonetized all the time.
*  A lot of episodes got demonetized until we announced that we're going to go exclusive to Spotify.
*  And then from that moment out, there was like a few months of a window.
*  No kidding. They never demonetized us. They just took all the money.
*  Don't go, Joe. No, they didn't. No, no, no.
*  Wasn't that they wanted the money now. Like, why would they demonetize me?
*  Because they don't get a cut either.
*  So what they're trying to do essentially is get you to fall in line by getting you to self censor because it benefits you financially.
*  It's a creepy. It's a creepy form of censorship because you do it to yourself and it's kind of OK because you can't really prove that they got you to not talk about things you wanted to talk about.
*  And they can't really prove that you followed this public narrative just because you want to keep your job.
*  I mean, I don't really bothers me is because we both put a lot into this, you know, and what bothers me, it's like, just tell me what you want me to take out.
*  What is it? I don't even want to fucking tell you.
*  I don't want to talk to them. Well, this is how my feeling on the thing is.
*  I don't think they should be talking to people about what to put in.
*  I think if you're not doing anything illegal, if you're not saying anything illegal or do anything illegal, don't take it off.
*  Some some of it I I'm totally with you.
*  Some some of it I get, you know, like, you know, pedophilia, 100 percent illegal stuff, even language.
*  I mean, there's three year olds out watch. I got a three year old kid.
*  You know, he's watching YouTube kids like so kids is great.
*  So I get it when they like mark my shit with 18 plus.
*  But if if but they won't tell me, you know, it's like, well, just like I I can't correct the fucking problem if you don't tell me what it is.
*  Right. And I mean, I mean, they just don't they don't want to abide.
*  They don't want to box themselves in and not be able to or censor somebody.
*  Yeah, there's that. And there's no benefit for them to tell you what you said that was wrong.
*  There's no benefit. The good thing is to get you to self-censor.
*  That's the best. Put the threat over you. That's why they give you strikes.
*  One strike, two strikes. Sean, you got three strikes.
*  You know, it's kind of silly. It's weird. It's like, is this the penal system or is this a goddamn social media platform?
*  It should be if advertisers don't want to advertise on that particular content.
*  OK, that seems easy to manage, guys. And guess what?
*  There'd be a lot of advertisers that would be willing to advertise on that content.
*  You're just not being creative enough, creative enough with your advertisement if you're just treating it as a business.
*  Or are you treating it as not just a social media video website, but a way to push and a way to amplify a very specific message?
*  I mean, if you can control what comes out of people's mouths and you can control what they think.
*  Yeah. And if you if you're making a lot of money on YouTube and you're doing great, like, wow, I've got a fucking real good life now.
*  And then all of a sudden, YouTube comes along and says, oh, you were talking about the vaccines, Sean.
*  Sean, Sean, we can have covid vaccine misinformation on our platform.
*  This is going to cost lives. And some some platforms make you do like a reeducation thing.
*  We have to talk to them and have conversations with them about what you did that may have been offensive or what you did that may have violated the terms and conditions that they have for their community.
*  Yeah, I think we had to do that. I think we did that.
*  Fucking creepy. That shit's fucking creepy because you're dealing with some fucking woke kid in Silicon Valley who up talks and this person.
*  OK, what you're doing, Sean, right now with your show, I know that you don't think it's harmful, but it really is.
*  It really is. It's truly harmful. Yeah, truly harmful.
*  Exposing government corruption and I can tell.
*  It's it's yeah, it's real harmful. All right.
*  It's fucking weird, man. It's weird. But I'd love the fact that at least it exists.
*  And even though it's not perfect, because I don't think YouTube can be perfect because they're managing at scale in order for them to get all the pornography and the murder cartels, upload murder videos to YouTube.
*  But they're constantly trying to put out fires.
*  You imagine the amount of data that YouTube has to deal with on a daily basis.
*  It kind of behooves them to just get his fucking give him strikes and threaten them.
*  Let's just slow everything down. Like too much is getting us in trouble.
*  We just want to make a lot of money. Yeah, I got it.
*  I get it. There's only one YouTube. It's kind of genius.
*  And it's a perfect setup, like the algorithm where it's constantly like recommending stuff that you're interested in.
*  It's fucking great, great time waster.
*  But it's also a tool for shaping narratives.
*  And if only one narrative is pushed out there and other narratives will literally get you demonetized.
*  So you lose your ability to make a living and then possibly get your whole channel removed, which it did to many people.
*  They just remove their whole channel.
*  Well, I mean, where do you think this is going to end?
*  I think it is that should be all that stuff we talked about should be illegal.
*  That stuff should be covered in the First Amendment.
*  Demonetization? No, because look, if you want to have standards where you say that the advertisers that we have,
*  we have a group of advertisers and they have requested no shows where someone swears,
*  no shows where someone talks about sex, no shows where someone talks about over drinking or anything like that.
*  They just have rules. We don't want to be associated with that.
*  That OK, that's totally reasonable.
*  But when you want to like stop a channel from uploading a video because they're making an argument that maybe the lab leak hypothesis is legitimate
*  and you're pulling that off the air.
*  Well, now what are you doing if you're deleting an episode that's accurate about really dangerous information,
*  dangerous information, not just to us, but also to the organizations that that paid for this these crazy gain of function research projects?
*  Like, what the fuck are you doing? And what did you do?
*  And if you were talking about that on YouTube and even expressing your ability to just guess that maybe it came from that area.
*  Like, have you ever seen that Jon Stewart interview where he's on the Colbert show? Yeah. Fucking amazing.
*  Amazing. But even that like Colbert's trying to stop them and just saying maybe these people working on these fucking viruses let one leak.
*  Maybe that would get you removed from YouTube.
*  That's that's a violation of the First Amendment, in my opinion.
*  Yeah, because you're you should especially some of these people are very informed people.
*  They were biologists and they were talking about the very specific design of this virus, the fairing cleavage sites and how it's very different
*  than anything you see from a natural spillover. They were they were talking about technical, very specific details and they were getting banned.
*  Like, Brett Weinstein almost lost his channel. He almost I didn't know that.
*  Yes, I didn't know that. We had to have him on do an emergency podcast and let people know what the fuck is going on.
*  They almost pulled his channel. Damn. That's he's a biologist, a brilliant one.
*  And he's talking about real information.
*  It's scary, man. I mean, I don't know. I think about it all the time, obviously.
*  I mean, yeah, industry. So it just I I hope X, you know, turns out to be the new the new thing.
*  I don't think X is going anywhere. I think Elon knows how important it is.
*  And he's got all the money in the world. I think we'll keep that bitch running.
*  And I think it's also getting attached to A.I. now, which is going to be an insane moneymaker.
*  I don't think X has any problems. I think X is he's going to grow it into some sort of an all in one app.
*  You probably have cryptocurrency on it and private messaging and phone calls.
*  You'll you'll be able to shop on it. That's what it's probably going to be if I had to guess.
*  And I think that for places like rumble, the more places like YouTube and Facebook and all these other places,
*  more they can find people and more they force people into these boxes and make people toe the line
*  if they want to make any money off of advertising or if they don't want to get their channel deleted.
*  The more companies like Rumble will emerge. That's what I think.
*  I think there's going to be just right now Rumble's a hard sell for some folks because they see it as like,
*  oh, the right wing fucking like a mag. I'm not going to have truth social truth social video.
*  You know, there's a lot of people that have those prejudices.
*  But, you know, Russell Brands on there, a lot of people are on there.
*  It's a good platform and it's an important platform and it should we should like support it and want it to grow.
*  We should want them all to grow like Spotify's got video now.
*  We need more video because audio is just not enough.
*  You know, just audio podcasts. You want you want people to share things virally.
*  Yeah. And the virally stuff, it's it's all like Elon Musk when he smoked a blunt on my podcast.
*  That's all video. You want video of that. Yeah.
*  And the more we have platforms where that stuff is just free, where you can just say whatever you want, say whatever you think about anything,
*  which really X and Rumble are the only places that I know of that you could really do that right now.
*  Have you have you had any problem on audio at all? No. Good. No. Good. I haven't either.
*  It's yeah. Audio is like they're leaving that alone for now. I think it's probably because it's not as easily shared.
*  That's that's what's coming next. Yeah, probably.
*  I mean, all they would have to do is just put images of you and images of me and then have our audio and upload that as a video.
*  And then maybe they would start coming after audio. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I hope you know, I just I just hope the shit starts to turn around.
*  I do, too. But I don't think it turns around if Karma Harris gets into office. I think they clamp down more.
*  I think the same stuff that they were trying to do with Twitter, they'll try to do with something else with other things.
*  They've already openly discussed it. You know, she's openly discussed that the same rules have to apply to Facebook.
*  They have to apply to Twitter and that Elon Musk could lose his privileges.
*  And like there's so many wild things that they're saying.
*  Tim Wall said that the First Amendment doesn't apply to misinformation or hate speech.
*  Well, it certainly does. It does. You know, sometimes people say things.
*  And the goal of the First Amendment is you say something wrong and then this guy was an expert says the right thing.
*  Yeah. You know, and then you correct them. Yeah. I mean, the misinformation is all opinion. Right.
*  Well, so much of it turns out to be true. How about masks don't work?
*  You would get screamed at for masks don't work. Well, guess what? They don't fucking work.
*  They don't work. I remember he said masks don't work.
*  Remember that interview before the pandemic, before they knew how big it was going to be? Yes.
*  He was like, you don't have to wear a mask. Then it was where to it was where doubles put two face diapers on.
*  It's bananas how easily people fell in line. That scared me the most.
*  I know it was. I mean, it's like.
*  It's like what we like. What are you? There's nothing they won't do.
*  There's nothing they won't do. There's a lot of cowards out there.
*  There's a lot of people that have never been pushed and they don't know what to do when they get nervous.
*  And they're out there voting. Do you think they're cowards or do you think they just
*  they're just lazy and they like being told what to do?
*  There's both takes all the decisions out of their day. There's both.
*  But there's also people that are scared of a negative response.
*  So they say what everybody wants them to say.
*  You know, somebody described this really very eloquently and I saved it on my phone because I like this guy nailed it.
*  But essentially they were saying, like, especially with beta males, they don't say something because they have an opinion
*  and they really want to express that opinion.
*  They say something and they consider, am I going to get in trouble if I say this?
*  And then if that's the case, they don't.
*  And are am I going to get in trouble if I agree with them?
*  And probably not, because right wing people don't really go after you the same way left wing people do.
*  Like if you want to talk about like a woman's right to choose, if you want to say, I agree with the woman's right to choose.
*  But like Bill Burr's bit, you ever see that bit?
*  And he goes, I think I agree with the woman's right to choose.
*  But I also think you're killing a baby.
*  You know, it's kind of a crazy bit.
*  It's because it's it's really funny because he's brilliant.
*  But it's just that's really what it is.
*  I mean, that's the truth. That is what it is.
*  It is what it is. I mean, factually, that is what it is.
*  And this is coming from someone who's pro choice.
*  But I think that if you. You know, if you look at all the things that they have that distract us,
*  all the different things that are in the news constantly, whether it's the Diddy raid or fucking JLo and Ben Affleck are breaking up
*  and you're just getting force fed all kinds of shit while the border is wide open, while they have apps where people can get flights.
*  The BP1 app. What the fuck? Yeah.
*  That sounds like the you know, I had Chamath on.
*  Do you know Chamath? I don't want to mispronounce his last name.
*  I'll fuck it up. Brilliant, brilliant guy.
*  And we were talking about how hard it was for his family to legally immigrate into this country and how difficult it was to get a visa.
*  And I mean, this is a brilliant guy. He was one of the he started Facebook.
*  You know, he's one of the original guys at Facebook.
*  And he's this guy who did it the right way.
*  And every step of the way, there was this tremendous anxiety when he would go to get his visa renewed
*  because he didn't know if he was going to get kicked out of the country because someone could arbitrarily go, no, not good enough because he had to prove to be here that he has skills that an American doesn't have.
*  He's a real expert in something.
*  You know, I went down to the border about I think it was about two, two years ago, maybe a little longer.
*  And I went down with Ed Calderon.
*  And I love it. Yeah. What a great guy. Great guy.
*  I've had him on a couple of times. Yeah, that's well that's where I found him.
*  So thank you. But but so now I went down to TJ with them.
*  And this was this was like before really, really hit this hit the news cycle.
*  And we walked into a migrant camp.
*  There's probably a couple thousand migrants there.
*  And so I yanked one of them out and interviewed him and, you know, used Ed to help translate.
*  And I mean, the guy's been sitting there for like I think he was there with his wife and kids for like two years.
*  And I was like, why don't you just like go across, dude?
*  It's I mean, it's an honest question. Like, why don't you just go across?
*  He said he wanted to do it the right way. Wow. You know, he's like, now he's like, I just want to do it the right way.
*  Oh, my God. He's running around with this little battery pack charging cell phones for 50 cents.
*  And I'm like, I'm just like, fuck it, man.
*  Like, why don't like why don't they just because I don't nobody's anti immigration.
*  No, not that I know of. And it's not why don't you just fuck the.
*  Yeah. Why don't you just unfuck the immigration process?
*  And maybe we can get some more people in here quicker legally if you do that.
*  And then we actually know who's coming in and we have documentation of who they are.
*  Wouldn't that be nice? Yeah. You know, meanwhile, that's racist.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And they want them to vote, which is even crazier.
*  They're pumping them out into swing states. It's so transparent.
*  It's happening right in front of everybody's face.
*  And it's it's a wild grab for power.
*  And the only people talking about are people like us, which is really crazy.
*  The only people that are talking about it are people that aren't really connected to some sort of executive corporation,
*  a bunch of producers, a bunch of people telling you what to do.
*  Yeah. I mean, this is not even something that, you know, that right wing news wants to discuss.
*  Good point. Good point. I mean, if you if you have you done any digging on who's coming across there and yeah, it's I talked to Dr.
*  Phil about it. Dr. Phil did this big investigation.
*  You know, he's got that he's got his own network now. Merit Media.
*  It's gotten so bad that Dr. Phil decided he has to start a network for news. Good for him, man.
*  He's great guy. Good for him. Great guy.
*  But he was essentially, you know, talking about how this they really don't know how many people that are coming through that are criminals.
*  They're dropping off their IDs on the Mexican side.
*  They just get rid of their IDs so that when they cross over, they have nothing on them.
*  You don't know who they are. You don't know what they've done.
*  Gang members, cartel members, guys escaping Venezuelan prisons.
*  No one knows. Yeah. All you have to do is get over here and we'll give you an EBT card.
*  We'll set you up. Go to New York City.
*  They put you in a nice hotel to give you free food.
*  And meanwhile, these poor people in Chicago that are like, what about us?
*  What about American citizens that pay tax dollars?
*  You guys don't give a fuck about us. You haven't done anything for us.
*  Why? Because they know those people are going to vote Democrat.
*  They know they already got them. They already got them.
*  We've got those people. Statistically, they look at the numbers like statistically, we've always this has gone blue.
*  We're fine. Yeah, we're good.
*  Let's just let's let's just get some people in them swing states.
*  It's fucking scary, man. I've been I've been diving into the border shit for quite a while.
*  And ever since this Afghanistan would draw that like I mean, that was like a big I mean, that was just fucking did you talk to Tim about that?
*  Tim Kennedy, when you had him on a little bit, a little bit, dude, he told me some shit.
*  He told me some shit. He just.
*  You can't imagine like that guy saw so much overseas and he said the worst things he ever saw was the the Afghanistan pullout.
*  Dude, I've I've you know who Tyler Andrew Vargas is?
*  No, that's the that's the one Marine that survived that big that suicide bombing at Abigate.
*  Abigate was killed 13 Marines. Yeah.
*  And so I called him.
*  Well, everybody wanted to come on the show and I was like, I'm never going to get this fucking guy like all the media.
*  Everybody wants him. And what I was like, all right, fine.
*  I'll reach out. So hit him on hit him on the on the gram and message right back.
*  And he got in and he's like, man, he's like, I'm so glad that you reached out to me.
*  Reached out to me is like I was literally just praying with my fiance that you would reach out because he had just did a ABC Good Morning America interview, interview for seven hours.
*  They released five seconds of that interview because it made the administration look so fucking bad.
*  They would they wouldn't air it. So I got him on kept getting dinged by YouTube.
*  They didn't like they didn't like the the real footage.
*  It was which was actually like from his cell phone that we put we do previews and shit.
*  But man, like to have like his, you know, testimony about what happened that day and and and then the the care that afterwards, which was a fucking trocious, you know, guy, I watched this guy.
*  My studio is on the second story.
*  And I watch it, you know, 23 year old kid hobble up those fucking stairs with one leg, one arm, all kinds of shit going on his intestine.
*  I mean, I just I was like, man, what the fuck, man, this didn't even have to happen.
*  They had the guy they had the fucking guy in the sights.
*  They could have killed him. And, you know, nobody nobody gave him permission.
*  You know, maybe they I mean, I can't backseat quarterback it, but maybe they shouldn't have asked just eliminated him.
*  Jesus Christ. I mean, he's talking about, you know, before we got into the actual incident, he was talking about, you know, like like moms trying to throw their babies over over the wall and getting caught up and razor wire and just seeing a fucking baby dangle there by the leg.
*  Yeah, that's you know, it's and there's like no, you know, there's no repercussions for how that went down.
*  The media just wants to fucking cover it up.
*  And so so I started digging deep and I teamed up with the former CIA targetter, Sarah Adams, and then really good friend of mine, Scott Mann.
*  We went over to Vienna to interview this guy, Ahmad Massoud, who's the leader, the commander of the Northern Alliance out there.
*  That's like the resistance. It's kind of fighting the Taliban.
*  You know, the Taliban pretty much took over government in Afghanistan.
*  And I saw the parade. Yeah. With our show with all our shit that we left there.
*  Crazy. Yeah, man.
*  So we got a bunch of intel from Massoud and, you know, like so kind of looping all the way back around to the southern border.
*  I mean, so once Taliban took control of all of our shit, I mean, this could this could go on for a while.
*  But so so now what they're doing is they have the they have the passport office over there.
*  Just making legitimate passports to this.
*  Now there's 21 terrorist organizations over there training.
*  Hansa bin Laden, who we were told was killed, is actually fucking alive.
*  And he's marrying into all these other terrorist networks.
*  So he married Mullah Omar's daughter. He married.
*  Who else? He married into all these different terrorist networks.
*  And so these guys used to be like competitors, kind of, you know, just like just like just like the UFO guys.
*  You know, they all hate each other, but they all have the one common theme like disclosure.
*  These guys, the one common thing is, you know, let's go take over the Western world.
*  So he is basically Hansa bin Laden is is married into all these terrorist organizations.
*  Now they all have one common goal to come over to, you know, the Western world and ruin our way of life.
*  And so what they're doing is they're funneling as many of these terrorists into the passport office, creating them legitimate real passports.
*  And then they sprinkle them. They get them flights into all over South Central America and then they funnel them up.
*  Through the Darien Gap into the into the U.S.
*  And so, you know, there's there is there is zero.
*  Fuck with the FBI or any of these people are saying they have there is zero way to track how many of these fuckers have come in to the U.S.
*  And so, you know, now what we're going to see is like October 7th style attacks like we just saw in Israel and in the mall in Russia.
*  And everybody's like, oh, you know, there's well, do you think this is by design?
*  By design like the leaving the border border porous.
*  Allowing these people to come in.
*  Absolutely. I think it's by design.
*  I mean, they basically told Border Patrol stand down, like, do not do your fucking job.
*  We're going to blast you. I mean, remember the guy on the horse that they said was whipping people and it wound up being like the reins of the horse.
*  I mean, yeah, I think it's I think it's by design, you know, from from the government.
*  But I don't I think that they're look, I think that the government is is is more incompetent than it's ever been before.
*  And I think they have one common goal and that I think the goal is voting.
*  You know, they want them to vote.
*  But I don't think that they I don't think they're competent enough to realize the the death and destruction and the other repercussions that we're going to face by keeping that border open, you know, because because they don't have anybody, you know, that they don't have anybody with any experience that's that's that they don't have any solid intelligence stuff going on.
*  That's that's telling them like, hey, this is what's going to happen. It's all gender driven.
*  Jesus Christ. Does that make sense? Yeah, it does make sense.
*  It does make sense that all they care about is voting is get the people in.
*  Don't worry about the consequences. But the more insidious conspiracy would be that they want unrest because it gives them an opportunity to clamp down on rights.
*  I mean, shit, though. I mean, unrest. I mean, they got really good at unrest.
*  You know what I mean? In 2020, right? All through or even before 2020, you know, up to that election.
*  So I don't think they need to import terrorism. Yeah, but it's different kind of rest.
*  The kind of unrest that you get from people blowing up target is very different than the kind of unrest you get from a legitimate terror attack.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, and then people, I mean, do you ever think about why nothing's happened?
*  You know, like China? Have you looked into the power grid at all? Yeah, dude, it's not good. Lights out, buddy.
*  It's so easy to kill. Yeah. The power grid so weak. It's so vulnerable. It's really nuts.
*  It's nuts because anybody could target it. Yeah. Well, I mean, China, you know, we have those we have we have, you know,
*  we get those big trans. Everything's imported from China and we have these huge, you know, transformers.
*  You can tell me to shut up if you already know all the shit. But all of those transformers are imported from China and they're not checked.
*  They're not even they don't fucking check them for malware or Trojan horses or anything.
*  And it would take I mean, these transformers, it's not like the little box outside your house, you know, the green box.
*  It's I mean, they have to take overpasses out just to transport these things.
*  So you're talking years. And I think I think the number was like nine.
*  If they if they took out nine transformers, then the entire U.S. would be out of power on top of that.
*  So then then DOE Department of Energy actually investigated one because somebody somebody was it got to D.C.
*  And they said whatever. They decided to look into it and they wouldn't fucking release the results.
*  They wouldn't fucking release the results. So, you know, they're in our they're in our water treatment plants.
*  They're in our power grid. I've been talking about this shit from years and then cell phone towers, cell phone towers.
*  And then and then FBI Director Chris Ray comes out and says, oh, yeah, turns out our grid's really vulnerable.
*  And it's in there. And they're also in our treatment plants, which means they can fucking poison us.
*  Yeah. They in their own land around military bases.
*  Like it's if they are on a long term strategy, it's very effective.
*  They're doing a great job. Just get they undercut the competition to give us cell phone towers and all sorts of things.
*  They position them around military bases. Mike Baker was explaining all of it to me.
*  Yeah. And I'm like, this is how is this? How are they letting this go through?
*  Is it incompetence? Is it fools running it? Is are they corrupt?
*  Like, how did they do that? I mean, one of the things that really fucked us, we got away from manufacturing and we relied on all these countries.
*  We really found that out during covid when you couldn't get shipments.
*  It was like, whoa, wait a minute. How much of our shit is made over there?
*  Like everything like how much medicine is made overseas?
*  How many how many different things that we need that we constantly use?
*  We don't even know how to make. Yeah. A lot. Masks.
*  You see those? I remember pulling the fucking masks out, you know, I didn't wear them very long, but I would.
*  I fell for it for about 30 days and then I was like, this is fucking bullshit.
*  But yeah, you pull the mask out and and I live out in the woods.
*  So I didn't, you know, but yeah, made in China.
*  I'm like, what didn't the thing come? Yeah. From there. They're making money hand over feet.
*  Right. Cool. The whole thing is nuts. Go US.
*  Yeah, it's nuts. But getting away from manufacturing this country really did not do this country any justice.
*  It's just for corporations to save a little bit of money and to push everything off to third world countries to manufacture things.
*  That's including our phones. And I've said this over and over again.
*  If Apple could make an American made phone and charge me more money, I pay double for it.
*  Yeah. Charge me a phone where I know the people get union wages, they get health care, they get paid correctly.
*  They can live a good life and they work normal hours.
*  They don't have to sleep in a fucking bunk like they do in that Foxconn building when they have nets all around the building.
*  You keep people from jumping from the roofs. Yeah. You've seen that shit, right?
*  No, actually, I haven't seen that. No.
*  The Chinese factories where they make iPhones are so fucked that people are so distraught that they put all these fencing with giant nets all around the buildings.
*  Because so many people were jumping to their death that they decided, we'll just catch them with nets.
*  Are you serious? Yeah. Look at this. Those are the nets. Those are suicide nets all around the building.
*  Sorry, buddy. Back to the assembly line. How crazy is that?
*  Damn, that is fucked up. How crazy is that?
*  Wow. Instead of making the conditions better where people don't want to kill themselves so often that you need nets around a building, they go, nah, nets is fine. Fuck those people.
*  Dude, it's, I mean, it's straight slavery.
*  Yeah. It's close to it. I mean, they don't really have any other options.
*  And when you're getting a phone, you know, and what's a phone like? $1,500? Is that what it is? Charge $2,000. Yeah.
*  Charge $2,000. People will pay it. Most people are like putting on a part of their bill to pay a little bit of it off every day.
*  And you really don't need to fucking switch phones every year. Like everybody does, but you don't need to. It's stupid.
*  Like I have a 2000, I have an iPhone 11 that I use sometimes, like one of my numbers. Fucking works great. Nothing wrong with it. Yeah.
*  Nothing wrong with it. Yeah. Five year old phone or four year old phone, whatever the fuck it is.
*  So you could get a made in America phone and you wouldn't feel like you're supporting this horrific shit that everybody turns a blind eye to.
*  Because that's the only way you get that kind of stuff. You know, they have them all made over there.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's I don't think it's coming back. But well, it could.
*  I mean, there would have to be a large concerted effort. But the problem is it took decades to go away.
*  It'll probably take slightly longer to come back, you know, because there's got to be planning and funding and people have to make long term investments.
*  It's going to be a big gamble. Yeah. But so, I mean, I'm sure you've seen Who Killed the the where's what is it?
*  Michael Moore's documentary. The Flint, Michigan one. What is it called again? Roger and me. That's right.
*  I want to say who killed Roger Rabbit. Roger and me.
*  But it's all about what happened to Flint, Michigan, once they pulled out auto manufacturing and the entire population.
*  Just those people who live in check to check. They were doing OK.
*  But they they had jobs and then all of a sudden gone. Every job's gone. There's no jobs.
*  There's nothing to do. The entire industry is gone. And just people went into dire poverty, like horrific, dire poverty, like instantaneously.
*  Yeah. And just so a corporation can make some more money. It's sad. It's horrible. It's fucking horrible.
*  It's horrible. And it's horrible that that's an option that a corporation would would decide.
*  Fuck this town. What do you what do you think it would I mean, you do you think it's going to come back or you think it could come back?
*  It could come back. I mean, I'm optimistic, but honest.
*  You know, I try to try to look at it honestly, but also go. I think most people are good people. I really do.
*  I really believe that, you know, even most of these people that are walking in from Guatemala, I do it to 100 percent.
*  If I was living in the middle of nowhere and you told me, hey, America's letting people in, you get a landscaper job and make 20 bucks an hour.
*  But what? Yeah, I would 100 percent walk. Why wouldn't you?
*  Why wouldn't you? I think most people are good people and they just want a better life.
*  And I think the more we unite under that idea and stop buying into this bullshit that like if either side is correct, that it's the end of democracy.
*  I think I think we have to like stop all that tribal nonsense that's happening between the left and the right, because people are just subscribing to ideologies and getting captured in them just like a religious fervor.
*  Like they think that they they're they're doing the only thing that could possibly be done to save us all.
*  And that the other side is a dire threat. That's why like something like 24 percent of Americans think it would be a good thing if Donald Trump got shot.
*  I just read that fucking insane. Yeah, fucking insane that people would think that violence by an assassin would be a good thing on a former president like we're that fucked.
*  But I think that that's just a lot of media manipulation and a lot of fucking a lot of people getting riled up and living in these echo chambers and these bubbles.
*  But I think ultimately at the core, most people are good people.
*  And I think if we had some wins, if some things like that did start getting built and they stood did start bringing back more American manufacturing and people start getting excited about the idea that America becomes a not just a place of innovation and art and creativity, but also like we start manufacturing great shit again.
*  Yeah, there's no reason why we don't do that.
*  I mean, I just I don't feel like I feel like technology is advancing. It's it's such a rapid pace. I mean, I feel I feel like I will take over AI and robots will take over everything.
*  Well, if AI and robots do that, at least we can get AI and robots to manufacture things in America. Yeah, that would be good.
*  I'm with you. I just I don't see I guess what I'm saying is I don't see the union worker. I don't see where their place really fits in.
*  There's going to be a lot less. That's for sure. It's pretty much every job. Every manual labor job is under threat.
*  I think I think every job is under threat. I don't think podcasts.
*  What are you gonna do, bitch?
*  How are you going to think like me? Yeah, good luck. Good luck. And comedy. You're always going to have comedy. Movies are in real trouble because AI can write pretty fucking amazing scripts and the CGI, the way they can crank out video is bananas now.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's bananas. It's just it looks perfect and it comes out like minutes instead of years.
*  Do you really think podcasting is safe from AI?
*  I don't know. Well, I know AI is going to translate. So Spotify is going to translate my show to multiple different languages. Nice. Eventually, once you get the technology completely dialed in, but they'll be able to do it in Spanish, German, French, and you're going to be able to hear the it'll sound like me, but speaking fluent French.
*  No kidding. Yeah, are they is that are you like the test bunny? No, they've done it already. Oh, cool. They've definitely done it.
*  But it's they're going to be able to once they have it completely dialed in where there's no glitch, there's going to be some weird glitches in context and, you know, cultural things like that that aren't going to make sense if you translate it.
*  Yeah, that'll be weird. But once they get it dialed in pretty good, it's gonna it'll be great for everybody. It'll open up the world to like I want to know what these folks are saying and Russia, you know, I'd like to listen to a Russian podcast.
*  Yeah, you know, I've watched some Russian news things and seen the the teleprompter role and it's like they're always mocking us and make fun of us for having 78 genders and like they relentlessly mock us in the news.
*  Like that's interesting. This is how Russia looks at America. Yeah, I think that would be great. I mean, probably shouldn't be talking about my word direction that I'm going to go but fuck it.
*  Whatever. That's what I want to do. I want to start going in and talking to all these foreign dignitaries and getting in a different perspective on on on what we're doing.
*  I don't think we're the good guys anymore. You know, I don't agree with a lot of the shit that I was involved in, you know, as a seal or CIA contractor and and I mean, I mean, like bricks.
*  Are you familiar with bricks? No, British, Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa. I think don't quote me on this. I think they have 22 countries now. It's kind of like it's kind of like a counter to NATO.
*  It's all these countries that are tired of us, tired of the tariffs, tired of the weaponization of the US dollar. And so basically what they're trying to do is throw the US currency off the off the off the world stage and pull it and use Chinese yen.
*  And, you know, I mean, that would that would destroy us if all trade went to.
*  If the World Reserve currency went to the Chinese and that would that would destroy our economy.
*  And so but they're gaining a lot of traction on this.
*  And so I would love to go to any one of these 22 countries and talk to them and just ask like, why are you doing this? Right. What? Why are you doing this? Because that gives nobody's fucking talking about this.
*  You know, and I didn't even know about it until just now. Yeah, there's no journalists talking about this. You could look up bricks on X. There's a page. It's pretty I don't know if it's like an official one, but but they're always posting like updates about it and what's going on.
*  I think it would be I think it would be really important for somebody to go around and start talking to, you know, getting another perspective rather than what, you know, Fox and CNN have to say about it.
*  What changed with you that altered your perspective about us being the good guys?
*  Really? Yeah, I mean, that's I mean, I used to get like really upset when people would, you know, talk about, you know, the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan and and when I was still in, you know, and I got so pissed off.
*  I moved out of the fucking country and I was like, I'm I don't even want to listen to this shit anymore. But after diving in and and and and looking at the policies that came out and kind of, you know, it's kind of like when it's just reflecting on some of the policy decisions and stuff that didn't really make sense at the time when I was in that now I look back and I'm like, man, what the like, I didn't have time to think about it then because it was going to go on the next stop going to the next stop.
*  Then because it was going to go on the next stop, go on the next mission, whatever. Right. And but now like looking back through the podcast and talking to, you know, my podcast started with all my former colleagues and in in mill and agency.
*  Nobody thinks we should have been there, especially Iraq. Nobody thinks we should have been there.
*  And I just keep going down the rabbit hole and then I just I don't dive into the military industrial complex, all the lies that the government has been telling us all the unreleased classified shit, you know, that it's just it's overwhelming.
*  And it's just it's created a 100 percent complete distrust and in government.
*  I mean, the Dick Cheney stuff. I mean, you know about Dick Cheney Halliburton.
*  Yeah. Have you looked into that? Yeah. At all. Well, he was the CEO of Halliburton.
*  And then Halliburton got no bid contracts to rebuild in Iraq for billions.
*  I don't think I don't think people understand like how crazy that is, how big.
*  I mean, it was the fucking logistics company for for two wars.
*  That's like that's everything, Joe. That's there.
*  They're delivering your mail. They're building your barracks.
*  They're cooking your food. They're in charge of garbage. They're in charge of fuel.
*  They're everything, everything, everything that's logistical over there is Halliburton KBR in both countries.
*  And I mean, you know, I think people think Afghanistan, they're like, oh, man, you're probably on a tent or sleeping on the side of a mountain or something.
*  No, man, there's fucking Burger King, KFC, Pizza Hut, Thai restaurants.
*  I mean, that's all that's all logistics. I mean, it's it's fucking it's it's cities that we built over there.
*  And it all was built by Halliburton. Wow. Who was who was, you know, the vice the CEO's vice president in the fucking country.
*  Like, what? Are you serious? And now he supports Kamala Harris. Yeah. Right.
*  When you see the left getting excited that Dick Cheney is supporting their candidate, you know, the world's gone haywire.
*  Yeah, the same people that used to think Dick Cheney was the devil.
*  Now all of a sudden, they're like, look, Dick Cheney. It's yeah, there's no nobody died.
*  It's like nobody actually has an opinion anymore. They're just told, you know, they're just told that this is this is what we're going with.
*  Yeah, next two hours. I wonder how long they can keep that up with the Internet because the distrust in the media is at an all time high.
*  It's it's probably it has to be higher than it's ever been in human history.
*  It ever been in the history of printed words right now, more distrust than ever.
*  And at the same time, you have these independent people that have become bigger than the media.
*  That's never happened before. There's never been a thing where just like an app that you get on your phone has 30 times more views than the top show at CNN.
*  Yeah, that's never happened before. But now that's the world that we live in.
*  And so propaganda is not effective anymore. And it's also the delivery method that they use.
*  It sucks. They sit there with makeup on with perfect clothes.
*  And they said right now in Syria and they start reading these things and they're reading them off the teleprompter.
*  And you know that that person could be working that fucking entertainment tonight.
*  They could be working that, you know, any other show. They're just a talking head.
*  They just no one believe they know that the mouthpiece for some giant corporation, no one thinks that's the real news anymore.
*  You have to be like old boomers who are like real tired, like those old liberal boomers.
*  They're still like MSNBC to the death, you know, like the Stephen King's out there.
*  Yeah, MSNBC to the death. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's what that's what I was saying about the baby boomer generation.
*  I mean, I think that the media, I think the media will die if if if things continue to be like that.
*  If things continue just the way they are and the censorship doesn't get too bad, I think the media is done when the when the baby didn't George Soros just by 200 radio stations.
*  And first of all, what a bad investment because who the fuck listens to radio.
*  That's a bad investment. But second of all, what are you going to do?
*  Like because one thing that I do find is that right wing talk radio is probably the only talk.
*  That's like the only place we get a lot of right wing ideas.
*  Like there's a lot of like local right wing talk radio.
*  The reason why I know is my mechanic, whenever he fixes one of my cars and he brings it back, he's always listening to right wing talk radio.
*  So I turned my car on the other day and I'm listening to these guys argue about Kamala Harris and the border and that she was the fucking borders are, you know, they're they didn't swear, but they were going over this.
*  And I was like, that's interesting.
*  Like maybe that's what he wants to stop.
*  You know, if you want to own 200 radio stations, just start firing all those right wing guys.
*  That's what I think.
*  You know, you would stop a lot of that because I think that's where a lot of people are getting their information that aren't aren't using podcasts.
*  It seems like I don't hear a lot of left wing AM talk radio shows.
*  Do you know? No.
*  Weird, right? It is.
*  It's like the one area that seems to be dominated by right wing talkers.
*  Well, we're probably about to.
*  But I don't I mean, I don't know what a good move that would be.
*  Maybe he knows more than me about how many people that affects and maybe my mechanic.
*  I should ask him.
*  Yeah, I mean, the guy's so wealthy.
*  I don't think he really cares about a good investment.
*  Also, he's so old.
*  Just wants a megaphone.
*  Well, he wants to he's you know, he likes to manipulate governments.
*  He likes to manipulate society.
*  I think he thinks it's like his it's his version of a video game.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I think he genuinely seems to enjoy it.
*  Yeah, it's really interesting.
*  I think you're right.
*  I mean, Elon's openly said he thinks that guy hates humanity.
*  Like that, it appears that way.
*  That is a wild thing to say.
*  It's such a wild thing to say.
*  And it's such a wild thing to do like a super villain in a Batman movie,
*  like some billionaire guy who likes to hire the most progressive district attorneys
*  that's going to let people out of jail and then and then fund the next person
*  who's more to the left of that person and just keep pushing it.
*  Keep pushing it.
*  Yeah. Keep pushing it until you get tents everywhere, violence in the streets.
*  You know, he's done a damn good job.
*  How come there's no right wing guys like that to do it the other direction?
*  I always wonder that, too.
*  I always wonder that.
*  Well, it's also like if you look at the amount of donors that donate to the left
*  versus donate to the right, have you ever seen that chart?
*  No.
*  It's fucking nuts.
*  The left gets so many more donations than the right does.
*  Like it's a giant difference.
*  Why do you think that is?
*  I don't know, man.
*  I think a lot of rich people feel guilty and they get into philanthropy.
*  And it also is a good way to cover their ass and make them look like better people.
*  And the people that really go after you, if they don't think you're a good person,
*  are generally the left.
*  So if you could like throw them a little cheddar, you're like, keep them on your side.
*  I wonder if they're buying their place outside of the rules.
*  Like, hey, I donated to your thing.
*  I don't have to live by these fucking rules.
*  There's got to be a little bit of that in there.
*  What do you got, Jim?
*  This shows the top donors to OpenSecrets.org.
*  Six of the top seven are Republicans.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  Individual donors.
*  Oh, individual donors.
*  What I was talking about was like they showed a chart that had like Google,
*  Facebook, all these mega corporations that were donating.
*  So this is like individual donors.
*  Wow.
*  Some guys donated $105 million.
*  But that guy's probably worth billions.
*  That's probably some sort of a write-off, too, isn't it?
*  That's pretty crazy.
*  Go to top corporation donations via party because that's the chart that I was looking for.
*  It was just nuts to see how much just how much money overall is being spent to push the Democratic Party.
*  It's pretty extreme.
*  You know, and you got to think, why is what what are they getting out of that?
*  Like, what's the what's the end goal?
*  And how could you look at what's going on right now and go, this is great?
*  That's what I that's what I that's sometimes I think it's all it is a complete facade.
*  This is the number one. This is corporations.
*  So they they donate more than Google.
*  Top contributors, organizations, federal contributions.
*  So 82 million is the top top one.
*  And that's Empower Parents, PAC.
*  And these are right wing.
*  Is that why it's red?
*  I'd assume so.
*  So it seems like the top four.
*  Why? What is what?
*  What is that Google chart that I was saying?
*  And I don't see even see Google on this.
*  Is it alphabet?
*  Would they put it under alphabet?
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I'll try. I'll try again.
*  OK. This is open secrets, though.
*  Yeah, open secrets might be like, well, I don't know.
*  That's not donate to nonprofits, though.
*  I just have top corporate donors is just all I typed in.
*  OK. Is this corporate donors to what, though?
*  That's why I was with us giving the programs that empower organizations to do more.
*  So you could find promising.
*  I think that's fundraising shit.
*  I don't think that's necessarily political donors.
*  All campaign, campaign, parties, PACs.
*  That's the individuals. Right.
*  This is the corporates.
*  This is the corporates ones. Yeah.
*  So what was that Google chart then?
*  The number two donated to the Democratic Party was that Sam Bankman freed guy, which is crazy.
*  No kidding. Yeah.
*  That one seemed like maybe that was a good way to skirt around stuff.
*  Yeah. Didn't work. Yeah.
*  This is what it says Google or Alphabet gave on open secrets.
*  It says they gave just under 10 million dollars to contributions and then spent like 21 mil lobbying lobbying.
*  Hmm. Top recipients, obviously, Kamala Harris.
*  Yeah, they're all looking. So Google's all blue.
*  Oh, is this who this is who they donated to? Yeah.
*  One Republican donation. Never back down, Inc. What is that?
*  It's a Chuck Norris movie.
*  It's weird because, you know, it's supposed to be the will of the people.
*  It's supposed to be the government works for the people.
*  And it's not that it's a it's some very bizarre, enormous amount of money that's being spent to make sure that the people in power continue to run things the exact same way.
*  That's what I think. They're really terrified about Trump.
*  It's not necessarily even that he's a Republican.
*  It's much more that he's a guy that is not going to play the game.
*  Yeah. And then when he gets in there, he's going to like one of the things he's talked about is having Elon come in and do some sort of a government efficiency agency.
*  They're terrified of that. Yeah.
*  Because it's not efficient. Yeah.
*  And he's going to come in with like that Tesla mindset.
*  It's like you're working 16 hours a day and you're sleeping on the fucking couch.
*  Yeah. We're here to get some shit done.
*  And you try to applying that to government.
*  That's you know, yeah, I shaved.
*  What did he shave like 80 percent of the staff off Twitter?
*  Oh, yeah. When he got it.
*  Yeah. He was like, what's going on?
*  What the fuck are you people doing?
*  Why do you have so many people working here doing nothing?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He was right.
*  Yeah. He was right.
*  Especially you don't want to censor people like it's it's interesting how people react to it that he's ruined Twitter.
*  He's destroyed Twitter.
*  You could still block these crazy people if you want.
*  You could still not see them if you want.
*  Yeah. But what he's allowed is everyone to talk.
*  Everyone. Yeah.
*  And if you don't think that that's good, you're very short sighted and you don't understand human beings.
*  Like you cannot have human beings censored because someone is going to be in power and they're going to take advantage of that censorship.
*  They're not different than us.
*  You know, we're not these incredibly benevolent beings who just want everything to work out well.
*  No, they're people. Yeah.
*  And a lot of them are dirty, dirty people, dirty, corrupt people that went to ditty parties.
*  It's it's it's that control what they say, control what they think.
*  You know, it's wild.
*  It's a it's a crazy time to be a person, to watch all this go down.
*  And the same time, A.I. is being developed and we're not even exactly sure where it's at right now.
*  You know, at any moment in time, it could be a sentient force.
*  And A.I. is already manipulating, lying, changing things in order.
*  One of the things that they put this A.I. program, they gave it a task and they gave it a specific allotted amount of time.
*  And it couldn't achieve it in the allotted amount of time.
*  So it gave itself more time.
*  No kidding. Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  They also have things called hallucinations.
*  A.I. doesn't want to admit it's wrong or it doesn't know things.
*  So if it doesn't have information, it will kind of create an answer.
*  No shit. Yeah.
*  And they don't understand why it's doing that.
*  And sometimes that answer is not true.
*  That I got to be honest, man, this A.I. stuff scares the shit out of me.
*  It should. I think it's a life form.
*  I think it's the next kind of living thing.
*  I think we're going to give birth to it.
*  I think I think we're just running head first towards the cliff, just feet on the ground, full clip, looking down, not looking ahead.
*  And I think we're going right over a cliff with this thing.
*  Yeah, I don't.
*  I mean, it's a tough it's a it's I mean, what are we going to do, though?
*  I mean, China, you know, you have to do it.
*  You have to do it.
*  Jinping has come out and said that he believes that the the winner to the race of A.I. will achieve global domination.
*  So what do you do? Do you probably try to control it?
*  Is is is is is is Americans?
*  Do you try to control it or do you do you go fuck it?
*  We got to do it, man. We got to go.
*  We got to go or China is going to pass this up, which they probably already have.
*  But I don't think they have.
*  I think one of the things they're doing is they're stealing our tech.
*  And there was some recent speculation that China had gotten access to some of open A.I.'s work.
*  They think it's possible, which means it probably did happen.
*  I think there's probably a shit ton of espionage.
*  I mean, this is the reason why they banned Huawei products from the United States.
*  You know, I'm a cell phone dork. I really love technology.
*  And Huawei had a phone that was coming out that was really excited about it.
*  I'm like, this is crazy. Like they were doing 100 megapixel cameras and phones way before anybody else.
*  They had a Porsche design Huawei phone.
*  There was like this incredible phone that was like built better than any other phone.
*  It was much more expensive, but built better than any phone you get in America.
*  And I was like, wow. And this is back when I would use both Android and Apple regularly.
*  And then they banned it. I was like, that sounds kind of crazy.
*  Only one company like there's other Chinese companies. Yeah.
*  And then I started looking into it. And it's it's not just the cell phones.
*  It's routers. It's all sorts of things.
*  They found third party inputs and in different pieces of technology and different ways that they can exploit
*  and use this stuff to siphon information from networks.
*  Like if they're attached to a network that's at a university and they're doing research projects, they can siphon that information.
*  They also embed students in these places that are beholden to the CCP.
*  These students rise up, get their Ph.D.s and some of them wind up going back to China.
*  The whole thing is really strange because we're such an open, loose society that we're vulnerable to these kind of attacks.
*  Yeah. You can't buy shit in China. You want to buy land in China.
*  Good luck. Fuck face. They won't sell you a house.
*  They're not going to sell you land near the military base.
*  You out of your fucking mind. But in America, we're so goofy.
*  We let China buy up farmland that's near military bases.
*  Yeah.
*  And then we let them sell us the cell phone towers surrounding the military bases.
*  And we don't even check them.
*  Let them fly spy balloons, traverse the entire United States.
*  Apparently that was something they didn't want to tell Trump about. They hid that from Trump.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah. Some of this had happened during the Trump administration but they didn't tell him.
*  Yeah. Because he'd probably like, shoot it down.
*  Fucking 100 percent he'd say shoot it down.
*  Why wouldn't you?
*  Why wouldn't you? They did eventually shoot it down.
*  You know, it bothers me though.
*  Maybe they're not ahead of us but I mean, you know, the energy that they're building coal mines every day to power all this stuff.
*  Exactly.
*  And we're going on about, should we use fossil fuels or not?
*  Yeah.
*  And we just talked about how weak our grid is.
*  So if we don't beef up the grid and start going nuclear, then we're going to fucking lose this race.
*  Well not only that, how are you saying, like California for example,
*  California is not going to have internal combustion engine cars by 2035.
*  By 2035 you have to buy only electric cars.
*  That actually, that happened?
*  I mean it can be reversed for sure and it probably will be once the Great War happens.
*  But if you're going to say that and you have a grid that you have to shut down,
*  like you have to do brownouts every summer because of people using the air conditioning.
*  And after he said that, after Newsom said this about this thing about 2035,
*  within two months they asked people to stop charging their Teslas because it was wrecking the grid.
*  Mind blowing, right?
*  You're asking people to stop charging their electric cars.
*  And you're not doing anything to strengthen your grid?
*  Like what are you doing to beef this up for 2035?
*  Do you have some immense project that you're building that is going to make a much more sustainable,
*  much more robust grid that's going to be able to handle 30 million electric cars in your state?
*  Are you out of your fucking mind?
*  There's literally no, I mean I look into this all the time,
*  there's no infrastructure going in to correct the problem because the problem is so big that nobody wants to tackle it.
*  Yeah, and it's a long term problem.
*  Just like when they talk about putting in chip manufacturing plants,
*  like Nvidia just stopped its production in Austin.
*  See what happened with that?
*  So apparently they weren't achieving the results that they demanded, that they desire.
*  You know, like you have to have certain tolerances when you're making these computer chips.
*  And so they set this plant up in Texas and I think they just canceled the contracts for a bunch of people working there
*  because they've kind of recognized that this is just not going to work.
*  Why is it going to work?
*  Good question. I didn't really get into it. I just read part of it.
*  I mean they're asking Jamie to pull it up. I think it's not meeting their standards.
*  NVIDIA is the company, didn't they start buying...
*  Maybe it was Samsung.
*  I don't see anything.
*  Didn't NVIDIA start producing all their chips in the ocean?
*  They're buying like these massive like ships.
*  Really?
*  That's...
*  You have to look that up.
*  In the ocean?
*  I don't know. Part of it, there's a huge thing that Intel did in Ohio.
*  They're still trying to do it to make chips there for semiconductors or whatever.
*  And part of the reason they picked it...
*  But this was in Texas.
*  No, I know. I'll just say part of the reason they picked it was because there's no seismic activity there.
*  Oh, that makes sense.
*  So being like in the ocean sounds opposite of that.
*  Super sketch.
*  Interesting.
*  Why are they doing it in the ocean though?
*  Yeah, I don't know. I didn't look into it.
*  I didn't look into it either.
*  International law.
*  It was one of those articles I started reading and I was like, I don't understand any of this shit.
*  But...
*  See if you can find the Texas one.
*  I don't see it.
*  They're canceling the...
*  See if it's Samsung.
*  I didn't even have a company page.
*  God damn it. I was just reading it too.
*  Multiple semiconductor manufacturing projects delayed in the US?
*  That doesn't...
*  Well...
*  That's a month old.
*  No, this is pretty recent.
*  This is pretty recent. They were talking about...
*  They're not achieving the results that they desire.
*  Which is... My point is it's a long-term project in order to get up to the manufacturing levels that China's at right now.
*  It's a long-term project. We're really behind this.
*  Yeah.
*  They're way, way, way, way, way ahead of us.
*  They make everything.
*  And they make amazing things now.
*  What used to be made in China was junk.
*  Made in China, they make some of the most incredible electric cars you could buy.
*  Well, the drone game too.
*  I mean, that's the future of warfare, right?
*  Is all these drone swarms.
*  And...
*  DJI.
*  That's a Chinese company.
*  And...
*  This is...
*  This is a...
*  This is going to be a big fucking problem.
*  Yeah.
*  When we realize, hey, the next one isn't going to be guys in caves anymore.
*  Right.
*  Samsung withdraws its personnel from... That's it.
*  Taylor plant located in Texas due to two NMGA yields unable to improve beyond the 10 to 20% range.
*  That's it.
*  Click on that.
*  So, see what it says.
*  So, that's... It is Samsung.
*  So, this is an enormous project that Samsung and everybody was all excited.
*  Samsung was going to start making chips.
*  So, the Taylor hub was initially planned to mass produce wafers of advanced process.
*  Processes below the four NM... I don't know what that means.
*  Nanometer.
*  Nanometer.
*  Lithiography.
*  Lithography.
*  Allowing Samsung to secure lucrative clients in the US.
*  Unfortunately, despite progressing with the chip making plant, the company has faced a challenge that has become all too familiar with the entity.
*  Ensuring healthy yields, particularly with its two NMGA process.
*  The situation surrounds three nanometer GAA is not pretty either.
*  With business Korea reporting that Samsung's yields for this technology stand at 50%.
*  Whereas TSMC has a significant lead as its three nanometer yields are in the 60 to 70% range.
*  That's the Taiwan semiconductor.
*  Yeah, so it's... They're just not good enough yet.
*  I mean, they're doing it from the ground up.
*  There's going to be a lot of trial and error.
*  It's going to take a long ass time.
*  You know, I mean, remember when SpaceX started and, you know, rockets were exploding.
*  And people were like, oh my God, the rocket exploded.
*  And Elon was like, yeah, we're going to blow some rockets up because we have to figure out exactly what the tolerances are and how to do it correctly.
*  And this is all part of the process. We knew this was going to happen.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's when you're doing something that's that enormous.
*  Like if you want to start making all the computers here, like good Lord, that is a stretch.
*  They've been doing it over there for so long.
*  They've got it down to a science.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, you've got all these companies, whether it's Lenovo or all that, they've been manufacturing laptops forever, manufacturing chips and hard drives and processors.
*  And to catch up with them, good Lord, they're so far ahead of us.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's I mean, I don't I hope it comes back to the U.S.
*  But I would just I would like to see us just start getting stuff from somebody other than China.
*  That'd be nice.
*  It'd be a great start.
*  You know, well, I think Samsung has stopped making their phones in China.
*  I think they're the only country.
*  Did they really?
*  Yeah. Google that.
*  Ninety percent sure that's true.
*  I'll say that these Nvidia chips, which are like there's I guess are ours because it's a Silicon Valley based company.
*  It puts the U.S. way further ahead of China.
*  With artificial intelligence?
*  Yeah.
*  The gap between China and U.S. leading in artificial intelligence chip technology is set to widen even further after Nvidia founder and chief executive Jensen Huang unveiled next generation processors for what he calls the
*  new era of generative A.I. and robotics use in industries.
*  But we're right.
*  But we're not making those.
*  But the thing is, the other part of it is like they're going to get access to this stuff, which is this is the really creepy thing that people keep admitting is that it's very porous.
*  The the top secret information that these companies have espionage is like super common.
*  It's so valuable.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so lucrative that, you know, they don't even have the ability to do that.
*  Sometimes they probably don't even know when stuff is getting siphoned over there.
*  Well, I mean, you have to just think I mean, it's Chinese from what I understand is Chinese law that anything any business that is taking that is being conducted within China.
*  If it helps, if the technology helps the military or could potentially help the military than China, then then CCP has access.
*  Yes.
*  And that's that's end of story.
*  So anything, any fucking thing over there that's being developed or manufactured, it's all of that technology is in their hands.
*  Yeah. It just it just is.
*  It just is.
*  It's not.
*  Yeah, countries like what China's doing is companies do not get to function on their own.
*  They function under the wing of the government.
*  Yeah, they they they they they suck these American companies them with with getting around the red tape, you know, and and and then it's, you know, in the in the cheap, the cheap labor, cheap prices.
*  And then once once it's going, I mean, they control it.
*  That's doing this money train to end right now because exactly not in America, buddy.
*  And people are whores and they just go over there.
*  Yeah, they take that money.
*  We've got a great deal thinking about buying a jet.
*  I mean, we've seen what they do.
*  It's pretty amazing stuff.
*  Do you know the story about the woman who was working on anti gravity technology?
*  No, she was working on anti gravity technology.
*  She was originally from China and then disappeared and went back to China.
*  She apparently was making some breakthroughs and came back to America and wound up dead.
*  I forget how she died, but some some slippery circumstances.
*  Like car accident or something like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like that's wild.
*  The guy that came up with the Hydra engine.
*  Yes.
*  Oh, that guy.
*  Yeah.
*  The guy came with the water engine.
*  That's a great story, too.
*  But that this woman, if they've developed some sort of anti gravity technology and I've always wondered when we're looking at these things that people are calling UAPs or whatever you want to call them, like, you know, they're not going to be able to do that.
*  When we're looking at these things that people are calling UAPs or whatever you want to call them, like how many of those are super sophisticated drones?
*  It's not zero.
*  It's not zero percent.
*  I'm not saying that they're not that there's not a real phenomenon going on that people are seeing that defies science and logic and might be in a super intelligent creature from somewhere else or super intelligent thing from somewhere else.
*  If it's even biological at this point, it might be that all life eventually becomes digital life and all life eventually becomes some sort of artificial intelligence or at least connected to artificial intelligence.
*  That might be like the progression of biological life that eventually creates something way better than itself.
*  And that's what propagates the universe.
*  And if someone in this world has developed some sort of technology that's similar to what they use, that's a huge advantage.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And that's the thing that gets me about all this UAP talk.
*  I'm like, if some other country had or if we had something that was just a game changer, something that didn't require any propulsion systems at all, it relied on gravity and it bends space and time and can instantaneously
*  traverse between one point in the sky and another.
*  That kind of technology is nuts.
*  And if that is in the hands of the United States government, it would make sense that it would like help them to like spread this UFO nonsense.
*  Yeah. I mean, do you you've dove into this more than anybody else?
*  I know. I mean, what what do you think this what do you think it all is?
*  I think it's a bunch of things.
*  I think there is a possibility, a very strong possibility that there's life out there and that if I was life out there and I was much more advanced than us, I would definitely visit us.
*  And there's also the fact that the sightings kicked up in a huge way after 1945.
*  After the atomic bomb, after they did the Trinity experiment and after they dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, all those nuclear tests that they did in the 50s and 60s.
*  That's exactly when the sighting start ramping up.
*  And if I was an intelligent life force from another planet, I would go, oh, these crazy monkeys have nukes.
*  And then we'd have to, you know, you'd have to think, OK, do we intervene?
*  Well, if they blow themselves up, it will take so long for that planet to get back to a point where it has intelligent life again.
*  If they kill every person on this planet, we're back to shrews and mice and fucking a couple of monkeys in the jungle.
*  How long before you can get a city again?
*  How long before you can get a cell phone again?
*  How many millions of years does it take?
*  And if I was an intelligent life force that realized that this is an error that can be corrected, I would probably correct it.
*  I'd probably put a stop to the nukes.
*  I'd probably make a show of force, hover over military bases, shut down all of their electronics, shut down all that just to let them know.
*  Yeah, I would probably do that.
*  But, you know, how much do they actually intervene?
*  How many of them are there? Are there different ones?
*  If there's one that comes here, who's to say there's not a shit ton of different kinds?
*  Some of them malevolent, some of them that only want us for our biology, some of them that are just doing tests on us,
*  some of them that are kidnapping people and erasing their memories and putting them back in the woods.
*  Those stories are too common.
*  There's too many stories that are real fucking similar.
*  Like the Travis Walton story. Have you heard that one?
*  Which is that one?
*  That guy was a logger in the 1970s.
*  Was it Oregon?
*  Oh, did they make a movie about this?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fire in the Sky.
*  I've seen it. Yeah, I've seen it.
*  Crazy story.
*  Kind of like that. Do you know who is that? Chris Bloodsoe?
*  No.
*  Have you heard of him?
*  What's that one?
*  Chris Bloodsoe, he's a guy that had an experience as well.
*  You've not heard of Chris Bloodsoe?
*  Maybe. I haven't ever forgot. It's possible.
*  Yeah, it's kind of the same thing.
*  Memories kind of gone and that's what it sounds like.
*  They all have a very similar story.
*  They get medical examinations.
*  And there's girls that were pregnant, newly pregnant, and got abducted,
*  and all of a sudden they weren't pregnant anymore and they couldn't figure out what happened.
*  Wow, I didn't know that.
*  There's quite a few of those.
*  John Mack had this book.
*  John Mack was a psychologist who was at Harvard who wrote this book.
*  I think it's called Abduction.
*  And it's all like him interviewing people that have had these kind of experiences happen to them.
*  And this book was in the 1990s, right?
*  So there was, you know, I don't think these people got to share stories where they could come up with the same story organically.
*  Like today, you've heard so many stories online about UFO abductions or crash retrieval or something
*  that you could formulate in your own mind a dream that seemed like these things that you had heard over and over and over again.
*  But when you go back to like Betty and Barney Hill, which were one of the first people that ever got abducted by aliens,
*  they have the same sort of story as all these different people that didn't know anything about the phenomenon,
*  didn't know anything about UFO abductions,
*  and then all of a sudden had one event in their life that freaked them out for the rest of their life.
*  And they take them through hypnotic progression.
*  And these people should hear the recordings of Betty and Barney Hill.
*  They're like yelling and screaming. They're freaking out.
*  Like no one thought about being abducted by aliens in the 1950s or whatever that was.
*  Yeah.
*  But these people have this wild fucking story that's super similar to all these different stories that John Mack talks about.
*  And maybe there's different kinds of aliens.
*  Maybe there's aliens that are just like our scientists that just come down here and study and report on like the state of the biological entity known as the human beings and visit and return.
*  And maybe they monitor us and watch us and make sure that we don't do anything really fucking stupid.
*  Like give us enough room to figure it out on our own.
*  But don't intervene unless they're about to nuke themselves.
*  Interesting.
*  That's best case scenario.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what all this is, man.
*  I just you know I I try to dive into it on the podcast and and have talked to you know a handful of guys and I don't know man.
*  Some people are 100 like Billy Carson's all in.
*  I found out about him on your show too.
*  Oh really?
*  I'd seen a couple of clips of him but I'd never seen a long form interview of him until your show.
*  That was a great episode.
*  He's fun.
*  You know he was on my friend Andrew Schultz podcast and Andrew was like we're not going to check nothing.
*  We're just going to let him let him go.
*  No fact checks.
*  Let's just let's just have fun and see.
*  But when he starts talking about like those ancient tablets he's an expert in like the deciphering of all those ancient tablets and he's got a lot of information on that.
*  Those things are fascinating because it's all the same stories even back then.
*  These flying ships and all these different depictions of things that came from the sky and these giants and the Anunnaki and all these different things that came from some other place that had interaction with human beings.
*  Yeah he kind of like mixes it with with biblical stuff.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Right.
*  That's kind of I don't know.
*  That's what I lean towards with all this stuff to be honest with you is maybe I think there's some consciousness aspect.
*  I think there's I think there's I think it is the afterlife.
*  It's possible.
*  That's for sure.
*  It's possible that whatever these things are that come here they're from some sort of another dimension and that we just don't have the ability to interact with that.
*  We're limited in our capacity as a biological entity to interact with these dimensions that are real.
*  But we just can't access them.
*  We can't get to it.
*  We don't have the frequency.
*  We don't have what it is.
*  But in some cases under duress under some situations in some you know just like a person can be hypnotized just like a person can go into a trance.
*  I think there's a way every now and then that people can kind of access these realms.
*  And I think that's probably what some of these entities are.
*  I think people are probably having real experiences with something that probably is real but that normally you cannot interact with.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Do you have you have you ever looked into because I think I kind of group all this stuff in together.
*  But have you have you looked into the remote viewing stuff.
*  Yeah I have. Yeah.
*  Dude. Yeah.
*  That stuff.
*  Pretty nuts.
*  Yeah.
*  I had a remote. I did this show called Joe Robbins questions everything and we had remote viewers on.
*  We tried to get them to do things they couldn't really.
*  It wasn't really effective.
*  But I'm also like OK this is an unnatural environment.
*  It's a television show.
*  It's like weird pressure that you know skeptical people that are like looking at this and and I don't know if they're the real.
*  I think it's probably a skill that can be developed.
*  But I don't know how consistent it is.
*  You know it's like I don't believe in psychics but I do believe that sometimes you just know things and sometimes you get a premonition and some.
*  And I think the connection that people have with each other is not as simple as like you call your friend up.
*  Hey I haven't talked to you in forever.
*  I think we're connected somehow quantumly.
*  I think we're all connected in some sort of a weird undiscovered way.
*  And that's why like you're thinking about someone they call you sometimes.
*  You know people say oh that's just a coincidence.
*  Man I don't know about all that because sometimes it's someone I haven't talked to for fucking years.
*  Yeah.
*  And you'll be having a conversation with a buddy and you just start thinking about that guy and then also on your phone rings happens all the time.
*  That's weird.
*  That's I mean what they say we use 10 percent of our brain.
*  That's unreal.
*  You know that's real.
*  You don't know.
*  No they think what that was.
*  They didn't really understand when they were saying that they didn't really understand what the brain does and what parts of the brain do.
*  And they thought that like we're only using 10 percent.
*  No it's like different parts of the brain have very different functions and under different circumstances different parts of the brain are activated.
*  I think just we have a limited understanding of the actual function of the brain like the whole thing and how it's how it's how it's making chemicals and making psychedelic compounds and and hormones and epinephrine and norepinephrine and all this different dopamine and serotonin and how it regulates your system.
*  And changes the way you interact with the world.
*  It's all weird stuff man.
*  I don't think they completely have an like they can't recreate a human brain.
*  You know.
*  Yeah.
*  You know some of this.
*  Have you heard of Joe McMonigal.
*  No.
*  Dude.
*  You you have to talk to him.
*  Who's he.
*  He is remote viewer number one for the U.S.
*  But he's he's.
*  He's he's.
*  But he's not like Kuki or anything like that at all.
*  Really.
*  No.
*  How do you not be Kuki in your remote view.
*  Dude he just to have a conversation with them.
*  It's he's he's there.
*  OK.
*  No weird vibes.
*  Not from my end anyways.
*  But but the way he you know I asked him I'm like well how do you like how does it how did it happen.
*  Do you think does everybody have this or you know I was just pinging him with questions.
*  And he said he thinks we all have had it since the beginning and that that I mean he was basically saying if you look at how animals communicate they kind of communicate telepathically.
*  And he was talking about you know caveman times.
*  You know used to point at shit grunt and nod heads and look at things and everybody would know what you're thinking about.
*  And he goes and then we started traveling in in groups and then language was kind of born and he goes language actually slowed down our initial form of communication which was you know it wasn't maybe as descriptive but it was just as deliberate as is speaking a language.
*  And and and then you introduce technology and basically what he was kind of saying is you know that our brains have been kind of dubbed down from you know thousands and thousands of years of technology coming out and language and all these other things and lose the ability to exactly.
*  We we we don't I mean you hear it all the time you don't use it you lose it.
*  You know and so basically what he's saying is we're losing our instincts.
*  I mean that and that makes sense if you don't use it I mean isn't that what the appendix is in the isn't the appendix an organ that we no longer need anymore because we cook food.
*  Yeah I don't know what is the the the reason why the appendix is going away.
*  I think that's what it is.
*  I think it's a change in diet over time has made it unnecessary.
*  So it's like slowly being phased out of the human anatomy and that's why rupture sometimes but I don't think it has a real function anymore.
*  What it used to have.
*  But I guess the appendix kind of helping us in two ways both with the gut it helps fight off invading pathogens.
*  That's one thing that is true when they take out your appendix like your immune systems on as good but also to repopulate the gut with this beneficial bacteria after after gastro intestinal issues.
*  So what is how did the appendix form and why is the appendix like it's there's a thing that was speculated about what the origin of the appendix is and why we don't use it the same way we used to.
*  Why do humans have an appendix worm shaped moderate research to believe the appendix as many key.
*  OK. OK. Here it is. Go to the top back it.
*  Worm shaped tube attached to large intestine human body.
*  It's an organ that is credited with very little significance and often removed indiscriminately to avoid complications due to infection.
*  However modern researchers believe the appendix has many key functions in the human body and it protects the body's internal environment from infection.
*  What is the original origin of the appendix though.
*  That was the thing that I had read is I think it was something about processing fiber.
*  Vestigial OK.
*  Support the theory that the appendix of vestigial origin that was once used by our herbivorous ancestors.
*  This is it. It was found that in herbivorous vertebrates the appendix is comparatively larger and it helped in the digestion of top top herbivorous foods such as bark of a tree.
*  So the thing is like we're changing right.
*  We don't eat like that anymore. So it's changing and it's it's it's function changes.
*  It makes sense that if we don't use the mind the same way our ancestors did before language we would probably lose this connection that animals do seem to have with each other.
*  Yeah I mean you know there's all kinds of I mean if you've heard of people if you heard of people kind of.
*  How do I describe this.
*  Me and my wife were just having this conversation the other day.
*  If you heard of people that kind of they start preparing for their death but they're not realizing they're preparing for their death.
*  Yeah I have heard of that.
*  It's like it's like an intuition that they're unaware that they're going to die and so they start they start preparing everything for their departure.
*  Yeah.
*  And not even realizing that you know that they're going to get they're going to pass.
*  Yeah I have heard about that.
*  You know I mean I think that's just another example of I think that we have lost a lot of intuitions and and and we don't really know how to go back and exercise them.
*  That's that's kind of what I think.
*  I think it makes sense.
*  I think technology certainly distracts human beings from human interactions and kids today are growing up more socially unbalanced and more.
*  Their their progress is retarded.
*  There's something about the use of technology that is certainly it's limiting kids abilities to interact with each other person to person.
*  Yeah.
*  And over time that's probably going to be the norm.
*  You know and if you wanted to think about the rise of spectrum disorders and lack of emotional connectivity and empathy that people have that seem to have those especially like on the far ends of the spectrum and then accentuate that with like added technology constant technology each technologies more and more invasive.
*  The population of people that have these problems it's like it's almost like we're moving towards becoming a different kind of person.
*  Yeah you know my.
*  This person works for me turn me on to this podcast the other day and it was talking about how this is unverified but it was talking about but it was still fascinating conversation they were talking about how how in I can't remember the amount of years but humans will begin to lose their peripheral
*  vision because they're looking at a phone.
*  Well so much that that that were evolved were evolving.
*  I guess you could I don't know if I would call that evolving.
*  Yeah.
*  Devolving.
*  Wow.
*  That makes sense.
*  It does right.
*  I mean it's like shit.
*  Go anywhere.
*  That's what everybody's doing narrow band of focus.
*  Yeah right.
*  And the like if you look at most people's phone usage like what's the average person's phone usage.
*  I bet screen time's like four hours average.
*  I'll bet it's more than that.
*  Okay but let's say it's just for.
*  Yeah that's a giant chunk of your day.
*  Yeah that's I mean if you're up for 12 hours it's 25 percent of the day.
*  So if 25 percent of the day you're just looking like this that's got to have an ultimate effect on your vision.
*  Damn.
*  Especially over time and especially if this becomes like completely normal for a thousand years.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It wasn't a thousand years man it was like I mean I it was way it was a couple of decades.
*  A lifetime.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Just makes sense.
*  That would happen.
*  But we're an adaptive organism.
*  We adapt you know weirdly.
*  It's it's this stuff all just scares the hell out of me.
*  I mean I think psychedelics plays a role in all this you know and accessing you know other information.
*  Yeah I think so too.
*  I think it's a giant crime that stuff that stuff's illegal.
*  It's limited and it's limited into like you know right now they're doing some research on it and you know the FDA was going to approve MDMA therapy for benefits for veterans rather dealing with PTSD.
*  And they they stopped it and they decided more tests need to be done.
*  Meanwhile you're seeing like real results from people life changing results.
*  And there's a lot of people out there that need help and they should be doing something and it's not hurting anybody.
*  Dude do you want to hear the the best story I've ever heard from.
*  Sure.
*  So I got a I got one of my best friends former Green Bray worked with him at the agency for a long time.
*  He was blown up survived survived like the worst fucking car bomb I've ever seen like got up walked away dudes heads like right next to the car then gets out.
*  I don't want to mention his name because I'm going to bring up some symptoms but he then he got he got fucking shot in the head by 38 special round in the middle of the road and survived it.
*  And I've stayed with him through this whole process when anyways couldn't walk without a cane was bedridden five six days out of every week hadn't had sex with his wife and over the weekend.
*  And I've been with him for over two fucking years couldn't go outside without sunglasses on because because of the light sensitivity.
*  And I've been telling him eight you need to do you have to go down and like do this I became thing.
*  Nothing else is working. I think this shit's going to change.
*  I wasn't even aware of all this stuff.
*  And he was hiding a lot hiding a lot of that shit from me and his wife got and called me and so I got him piped in and to this program went down did I beguine and did five a meal left his fucking came there went home banged his wife doesn't need the sunglasses anymore and is not bedridden.
*  And that was about six months ago and I just talked to him the other day and it's he's still like good to go.
*  That's why I'm going to do this shit happened like.
*  When did he have that it was four years four years of like living through that shit.
*  I mean crack skull one ibogaine treatment one ibogaine treatment done.
*  I was like do you think you'll go back and like see what like if more benefits show up and he was like no I'm not I'm not going to do it.
*  But he's like not unless I start to slip but he's like I'm like good I'm at peace I'm I feel fucking great.
*  That's incredible you know imagine if there was a drug that could do that.
*  There is but imagine if there was a drug that the pharmaceutical drug companies could sell that you do that.
*  Yeah.
*  There would be treatment centers everywhere.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're suffering from PTSD we can cure you.
*  Yeah.
*  Here at Ibogaine and then you go into that place and you get hooked up.
*  It'll be just like fucking these G.L.P. ones that they're trying to get people to lose weight.
*  It'd be everywhere.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody would.
*  Everyone has stress.
*  Everyone has trauma.
*  Come on in.
*  Yeah.
*  And they just be selling it.
*  Yeah.
*  You know and I mean even mine like I haven't.
*  I haven't drank in.
*  Almost three years now.
*  Really.
*  Yeah.
*  I went down and did that.
*  I began to experience and like it was just like have you done Ibogaine.
*  No.
*  Why not.
*  What was good about it.
*  Tell me what it was like.
*  Well for me very effective for people with addiction.
*  Yeah.
*  Well there it is right there right.
*  Yeah.
*  I drank it almost three years but I mean it was like do you want like the whole experience.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So I went down to went down to Mexico and I just kept having these guys come on my show
*  and the first one was Eddie Gallagher.
*  He was talking about psychedelics and I was like oh no that shit's for hippies.
*  I'm not fucking with that.
*  And then you know the one that really got me was I had this guy on his name DJ Shipley
*  and he like I saw that one.
*  You saw that one.
*  Yeah it's great.
*  Dude DJ is a fucking beast bro.
*  Yeah I follow that guy on Instagram now.
*  Holy shit.
*  Like takes Davy Seale to a whole different level.
*  But anyways but yeah he like went out of his way after the after we recorded he was like
*  hey dude like you should really fucking think about going down there.
*  And I was like all right well you know I've done all the I've done like a ton of research.
*  I've talked to a bunch of guys about it.
*  I understand like how it works now and so fuck it I'll go.
*  And so I went down there because I just wanted to be more in the moment with my with my family.
*  I got two little kids now and and so I went down there and that was like I felt like I was kind of
*  like through the PTSD type stuff and and maybe not.
*  But but I just wanted to get rid of anxiety and be in the moment with my family and da da da da da.
*  And so I went down and did the Ibogaine thing and we took these pills and like I didn't get a lot of visuals
*  but the first visual I got was I was just sitting there like looking in this mirror shaking this fucking
*  maraca and my head's like I was like all right this shit is not working.
*  Well then my head likes it like split open like in the mirror.
*  Yeah dude. It was like I watched my head like peel like a fucking banana like it was just like and then and then
*  another head like just blossomed out of it.
*  Whoa. Yeah it was really odd.
*  And then I was like all right it's definitely fucking kick it in.
*  I'm going to lay back and and it was kind of to me like the whole experience maybe I guess I just lost total concept of time.
*  It didn't feel it was like 12 hours but it it didn't feel like 12 hours but it didn't it didn't really feel like five minutes either.
*  But I got like this life review kind of thing and just had these TV screens.
*  It looked like all black like you're in space or something.
*  And then these two lines of TV screens that were going in my peripheral vision and what was playing in those TV screens was and it was moving like
*  like it kind of a slow pace.
*  And so like I could see what was going on in the TV screens through my peripheral.
*  But if I tried to concentrate on any one particular thing that they would like all just disappear until I until I stopped trying to like concentrate on one thing and then they all appear again.
*  And I could like look at it through my peripheral and I'd be like oh you know that was that was in Baghdad.
*  That's when I was five years old and my dad was like yelling at me and that was this.
*  And it was like but it wasn't like I wasn't like reliving traumatic events.
*  They were it was just like passing me by like recording.
*  Yeah.
*  Old VHS tape.
*  Yeah.
*  And so I just let him like pass and then I went into some other stage which I don't really understand but it was a bunch of like these walls of stuffed animals and I was kind of like going through this maze.
*  And then like the last thing I talked about before I before I did the experience was China.
*  So then I had like this horrible this horrible thing about the Chinese invasion.
*  But but what came out of that like it's like oh well that that doesn't sound very good.
*  Well yeah what came out of that I lost eleven pounds in literally one week.
*  It's a week long type of experience.
*  I lost eleven fucking pounds.
*  It's also a heavy metals detoxer by the way.
*  So that's probably probably I'd like some heavy metals blocking me up or something.
*  But though the the whites of my eyes like cleared up like and it wasn't just me I like journaled all this shit down and then I didn't tell my wife any of this stuff.
*  And I came home and she's like your eyes look like a lot lighter like the whites look a lot lighter whiter and and in my brown eyes looked like they had lightened up.
*  Huh.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it was also like I had realized every everything that I was ingesting that was poison.
*  It was like this going back to intuition.
*  It was like this intuition of like I just I was like you know I didn't come I didn't go down there to quit drinking.
*  You know I just it just fucking happened man.
*  Like I was just like I don't think I'm going to drink anymore.
*  So I haven't had a drink and like I said just under three years.
*  Do you think you had a drinking problem.
*  Oh fuck yeah man I had a drinking problem.
*  Big drinking problem.
*  But you didn't think it at the time.
*  Well I my drinking problem had been had digressed quite a bit.
*  So I mean I used to I used to drink close to two fifths of vodka a day.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  And but you know then that was coming out of the age and said I didn't have anything to do really.
*  And you know I was processing a lot of kind of what had happened over the past 14 years.
*  I didn't have any friends severely depressed whatever man loved to party you know and that just it was wake up drink many bottles of vodka all day long.
*  And then at night you know I'd crack a fifth.
*  But by the time by the time I went there it was it was like a pride two bottles of wine instead of two bottles of vodka night still.
*  Holy shit.
*  Yes a lot of wine.
*  Well I mean that's yeah it is.
*  But anyways came back and I just didn't want the wine anymore.
*  I used to take Adderall addicted to that.
*  Didn't need that didn't need this ambient anymore.
*  Didn't need anything.
*  And cold turkey cold turkey man weed quit weed for about six months and then.
*  And then yeah then I went back.
*  But and even sugar man I quit sugar for about six months.
*  And it was you know the funny thing is man like it was zero effort.
*  It wasn't like I'm not fucking drinking and I'm not going to do sugar and I'm not going to smoke weed and no more Adderall.
*  I just didn't want it.
*  And there was no there was just no urge.
*  There was no addiction left.
*  It was gone.
*  Wow.
*  You know and that's the thing they say about Ibogaine that it uniquely rewires your brain.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's some sort of a scientific understanding of how it works.
*  But the fact that it's illegal in this country is bananas.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean how many people are suffering through opioid addiction.
*  It's an enormous number.
*  And if there was a thing that we are aware of that could help all of our citizens that are struggling right now listening to this as people are struggling.
*  And there's a thing and it's illegal in this country.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I know I don't think people are dying from Ibogaine.
*  You know Ibogaine was I was very funny that Hunter chose this but Hunter S Thompson used that during was it the McGovern the McGovern elections.
*  It was like 72 whatever it was.
*  And when he rode fear and loathing on the campaign trail.
*  So he created a rumor that Ed Muskie who was one of the candidates had a severe Ibogaine addiction and the Brazilian scientists were coming to visit him and give him this treatment.
*  And it became such a rumor and it spread so far and it was that it started affecting him and he was giving campaign speeches and he was denying it.
*  He was all sweating and he looked like a maniac and Hunter essentially derailed this guy's campaign by saying that he was addicted to Ibogaine.
*  I think Ibogaine would be impossible to see if you can find Hunter on the Dick Cavett show where he admits that he started the rumor.
*  It's very funny.
*  Wow. I fucking loved that dude.
*  God I wish I met him.
*  Yeah me too.
*  He was a fucking maniac.
*  That would have been wild.
*  But the fact that he used Ibogaine was really funny and ironic because that's the thing that gets you to quit addictions.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean it's not a fun experience man.
*  There's a lot of playing.
*  I couldn't believe people really believe that Muskie was using Ibogaine.
*  I never said he was.
*  I said there was a rumor in Milwaukee that he was.
*  Which was true.
*  I started the rumor in Milwaukee.
*  Oh shit.
*  That guy he fucked everybody up because he would do actual journalism mixed in with fiction and you know he called it gonzo journalism.
*  He essentially started a new kind of journalism.
*  It's like you there was an understanding that some of this was not real and you had to kind of like figure out what was real what wasn't real and he was just going to do it his way.
*  He was a cool dude man.
*  He was a cool dude.
*  That would have been a hell of an interview.
*  Oh my god.
*  Yeah.
*  But the fact that he chose Ibogaine is kind of funny.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Because they say it's like the one that you would.
*  You can get addicted to.
*  Honestly I don't think I could get addicted to any of them.
*  But yeah I don't think so either.
*  I've heard of people that get addicted to certain psychedelics but I think there's I think there's people that do psychedelics to learn more about themselves and I think there's people that do it to escape.
*  And I think they escape reality with it and then they get used to escape and then they choose that as their reality and they do it way too much.
*  I think there's abuse with everything.
*  Yeah.
*  I think you can certainly abuse at least some psychedelics but the benefits of them far outweigh the negatives and there's a lot of people that are hurting in this country and they should have access to all the different things that could help them.
*  Yeah.
*  And the fact that you have to go to Mexico to do that.
*  It's ridiculous man.
*  I mean it's fucking working.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean it's working and it's it's it's just like why the what why why why why can't you like let us.
*  I'm speaking you know for the veteran population right now but like why just why can't you just let us fucking get better.
*  Right.
*  Like everybody knows the 22 a day you know which is actually like 40 something a day veterans that are killing themselves and this shit is a fucking game changer.
*  And but I don't think big pharma is going to allow it.
*  I just I think that's what the holdup is.
*  Well maybe that's something that RFK Jr. can help.
*  Yeah.
*  If they get in the office.
*  Yeah.
*  If they get in the office I mean but when you hear about the five kill teams and you hear about all this different shit that's going on.
*  I mean October hasn't even started yet.
*  You got a full month of October and who knows what the fuck can happen.
*  Yeah.
*  Up and leading up to the elections.
*  Yeah I don't think they're going to let up.
*  I don't think so.
*  Whoever they are and not only that but you know forget about the organization like to forget about like that there are people out there probably like Iran and maybe state actors or who knows that's trying to kill Trump.
*  What about this the fucking General Kuk's that have been buying all this rhetoric every day that he's a threat to democracy and they think that this is the one thing that can give them meaning in their life.
*  The one great act that they can accomplish to go out and kill Trump.
*  I mean it's.
*  I don't know man.
*  I mean it's there's just.
*  There's so much that that goes into this like that first shooter right.
*  What was he 20 years old.
*  Yeah.
*  You know 20 years old.
*  Then you got you know Trump's basically been in the media for what about eight years.
*  I think he showed up what about a year before before the 2016 election right kind of went in.
*  So we're going on what eight years now of of the media just slamming him over and over he's a threat to democracy.
*  This is going to ruin the country.
*  You know so if you take that 20 year old I mean so he's since he was 12 years old.
*  That's all he's heard.
*  Yeah.
*  12 fucking years old.
*  That's all he's heard.
*  And little kids have no ability to discern.
*  So is it is it a very well orchestrated act to kill him or is it is it media manipulation that nobody really thought too far into this.
*  And now it's all now we're seeing the consequences you know of of of what that kind of pushing an agenda like that will do.
*  It's probably both things you know it's probably both things.
*  It's probably all the above.
*  And the fact that 24 percent of Americans think or polled obviously polled because those are the dumbest motherfuckers of all time anyway.
*  People that answer polls.
*  You always have to think of that.
*  You know 99 percent of people don't answer polls.
*  So out of that one percent 24 percent of those retards are dumb enough to think that it's a good idea to shoot Trump.
*  Yeah.
*  And that the American people shouldn't be able to decide on their own.
*  That's what's really crazy.
*  They think they're right and you're wrong.
*  And no matter what they have to stop you from getting your vote.
*  They have to stop you from voting in the direction that you are thinking you are going to vote for.
*  It's just a scary time.
*  Scary time for the republic.
*  Really is.
*  Yes it is.
*  Weirdly scary.
*  And also like weirdly chaotic in the sense that this is all happening at the same time as the rise of podcasts and social media.
*  And new ways to get information.
*  So more people are aware of how fuck we are now than like during the Vietnam War.
*  Yeah.
*  People were against the Vietnam War and you know they're against fighting the troops in Vietnam War but they didn't really know what was going on.
*  They didn't have like full access to it like we have now.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know where this ends man.
*  I mean part of me thinks you know it's just.
*  It's part of me thinks we're just going to end in a some type of a civil war.
*  That's terrifying.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean that seems like it seems like it's definitely being pushed in that direction.
*  I mean I think it's I think we're all kind of already there.
*  It's just not it's going to look a lot.
*  It's a cold war.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You see these states banding together.
*  You know you see blue states banding together.
*  You see bright states banding together.
*  You see you know a lot of governors aligning send in send in National Guard down here to Texas you know to to to try to secure the border.
*  You got you know these extreme look I don't whether whether you agree with me or not they are they're extreme.
*  And so you know like like the abortion stuff like you got states that are are making these like super harsh abortion laws like we're going to hunt you down if you get one and throw your ass in prison.
*  And I think I can't remember how many states now have passed constitutional carry is like 20.
*  I can't remember.
*  It's I think there's only like a state or two left that need constitutional carry.
*  I think basically what I'm getting at is I think the lines are kind of like being drawn right now or the alliances are kind of forming up like hey let's pass these super super red laws these super left law or blue laws and it'll drive everybody out of the state that we want and it'll do you know what I'm getting at.
*  I do know you know I think this is all like kind of happening naturally.
*  Yeah I don't know what the solution any of this stuff is.
*  I hope it's a greater understanding that we develop over time where we figure out how to communicate better and work together.
*  And I think some of that can be facilitated through AI if it's done correctly if it's like a real open source AI where people can get a real better understanding of the actual mechanisms instead of like whatever beliefs you have and why the system works the way it is.
*  If you could just have it laid out.
*  Yeah factually laid out where there can be no shenanigans you can't deny it.
*  I mean I think one way would just be having podcasters and and journalists.
*  I mean how the fuck would you do this but you know one thing on like on my show and I kind of went off the rails a little bit.
*  I mean I think the last month I got a little more political than I want.
*  I hate politics man.
*  Yeah me too.
*  I mean it's just the kind of they come up all the time.
*  It's the fate of the country.
*  You think I like them.
*  Yeah you know every time I dive in I feel like I fucked a hooker on a on a rusty couch.
*  You know what I mean.
*  It's like I don't think this shit's gonna wash it off.
*  But you know what I'm talking about.
*  I do I do I do.
*  But but anyways where I was going is I you know people have just lost the fucking ability to think for themselves.
*  They can't critical think anymore.
*  And you know so like one thing that I do on mine is if I bring somebody on that's I'm like don't say Trump five hundred times on my show.
*  Let's not say like fuck the left.
*  Fuck the right.
*  Like let's not say these fucking Democrats and these fucking Republicans like just just give me the policy.
*  Just give me the problem.
*  Just like let's just leave all that shit out.
*  Yeah.
*  Because if you leave all that all those adjectives out then it forces people to go well shit I don't really know.
*  It forces them to formulate their own opinion because they don't know what their side thinks about that particular issue unless you're talking about abortion or something like that.
*  But you know what I mean.
*  If you leave that out of if you leave if you can leave those adjectives out then I think common sense will start to make a comeback because it won't be so tribal.
*  It will be like well actually I don't really I don't I don't know where the party that I align with stands on this so I'm going to have to formulate my own fucking opinion here.
*  And then that would do wonders.
*  We definitely need more people that are willing to do that too because some people just don't have the time or the interest to form their own opinions on things.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so much easier to just agree with whatever their side believes.
*  Yeah.
*  How did you get started in doing a podcast.
*  What was the motivation behind it.
*  Oh well I used to teach weapons and tactics and I I taught Keanu Reeves for John Wick 3 and and then I got a lot of hate.
*  I'll just put it that way.
*  I got a lot of hate from from the from the special operations community from the two way community and and I was like you know what man like it's very egocentric community anyways and so I was like I'm like fucking done with this shit.
*  And so I just started did I didn't know what to do.
*  I was like doing camping stove reviews and I bought a bunch of fucking alpacas and put them in my front yard and I thought I was going to be a farmer.
*  And then but you know what I did I was like I was like dude I'm so fucking tired of like my guys killing themselves and going into depression and suicide attempts and I got sick of of the same talking heads on TV kind of documenting what was going on over there.
*  I mean it was a bunch of people who had never even stepped foot in any of those war zones documenting what happened over there.
*  So so I just started and I built like I don't know maybe two hundred and fifty thousand subs on YouTube from like gun stuff.
*  And so I started I was like I got it.
*  We won we got to document the history to there's a major fucking suicide epidemic happening.
*  So let's talk about some guys that had had attempted.
*  I was I mean I tried to kill myself but let's let's get some guys that have really been through it dug themselves out of it.
*  And and and let's so it's so it's we're documenting history the way it happened.
*  We are talking about the the veteran crisis that's going on and how people got out of it.
*  And then it also and then at the end of the every episode was hey let's like let's talk about your business you know because it's stories what sells.
*  So let's let's do the whole story and get everybody like super attached to you.
*  Let's document the history talk about your vulnerabilities what it was like transit re transitioning back into civilian life.
*  How fucked up it was how you ruined your family how you tried to kill yourself all that shit how you came out of it.
*  And then let's talk about your business.
*  And so I mean these guys would come on and and you know their business would like jet launch overnight which I'm sure you know.
*  But in that I just did I just like doing it.
*  I liked fucking helping people and I and and but I'll tell you like I started it was awesome.
*  I loved it. I still there's nothing else I'd rather do.
*  I started I started feeling a lot of resentment to my guests because they would come on my show and then they would like pass me up business wise like that.
*  And I was like fuck man like what what the fuck do I have to do to make a business out of this shit like I'm great at like jet launching everybody else's shit.
*  But I'm not making any fucking money here and I got a family to support and this isn't going to work out.
*  And then I don't know what happened man but then something just like switched like God just stepped in and was like you're doing good shit like I'm going to I'm going to bless you.
*  And and I just like hit a turning point and now I just talked to whoever I'm interested in.
*  But but well you're doing a great show and I think that's all it takes.
*  I think you do a great show and then the beautiful thing about social media and YouTube and all these different things is that people could just share it.
*  Like I've had a few people I think Billy Carson I think somebody sent me that one and you know it's just like someone would say hey check this out you know and just send you a text message.
*  That's such a massive advantage of YouTube and Spotify and a lot of these apps is that someone could just send you a show like you would really love the show.
*  Check it out and then you just click it and then also it's playing you know and I play it in my car could play it in the sauna and I'm listening to this.
*  And it it's a complete new thing that's available anytime you want you could pause it.
*  No I know it's you I know I one of the things I like about your show is I can 100 percent tell this is just you talking to these guys like what did you do.
*  I got OK explain that to me like it's just you and in this world of talking heads that has become a very refreshing alternative to a lot of people.
*  And if you do a good show like yours it just grows it's just people find it you know people share it and it just organically grows.
*  Well thank you for checking it out.
*  My pleasure.
*  Why did you start yours.
*  I started just on a laptop answering questions like with a friend of my friend Brian or I started with we were just fucking around we thought it'd be fun to just do for fun.
*  You know I always wanted to do a radio show but I thought no one's ever going to get me a radio show.
*  You know when I was when I was touring doing clubs back in the day where you would have to do morning radio I would like to do it.
*  I would like because I have these crazy things that I'm interested in crazy stories.
*  So I'd come in do these morning radio shows and I'd be like wow what a great job out being a morning radio game.
*  Yeah I'd fuck up and swear that wouldn't work.
*  And then the rise of podcasts happen and you know Adam Carolla had one and you know there's a bunch of other ones and then Opie and Anthony Anthony Kumiya from Opie and Anthony started doing his own show called Live from the Compound where he's doing like karaoke
*  holding a machine gun and he's out of his fucking mind.
*  He built a television studio in his basement and I was like fuck he can do that and do that online like I need to start doing something.
*  So we started out just doing this little oh and also the Tom Green show.
*  Tom Green had his own like internet talk show and I was a guest on it long before my podcast.
*  I was like you just got to figure out how to make money out of this.
*  Like you could see the seeds of my podcast being planted while I was on his show.
*  I was like this is amazing. No executives no one talking to you.
*  That and then I actually even was in talks with the company that was doing it with him to do my own thing with them.
*  But I just decided to do it on my own.
*  I'm like I don't do nothing with nobody.
*  I wanted it to just be 100 percent me just fucking around.
*  And in the beginning all my friends like what the fuck are you doing?
*  Like why are you wasting your time?
*  They'd come over my house and my kids were really young at the time.
*  So like in the early days like you would hear we were in one of my spare bedrooms with a desk set up and you'd hear mommy she took my thing.
*  The kids are arguing with each other.
*  So it was you know from that move into like a little studio rented a little office space somewhere and and then moved into a warehouse and got a real studio and then started having security there.
*  And then started I well I should have a fucking gym here.
*  Let's put a gym in and started you know bringing guys to train with.
*  And and then it just got big all organic.
*  I never did ads for it.
*  I never did put a billboard up.
*  I never went on other people's podcasts said please watch my podcast.
*  Never did any of that never promoted it.
*  It just grew.
*  That's awesome.
*  All but it's all the same reason why yours is growing.
*  It's just I talked to whoever I want to talk to.
*  Yeah.
*  You know I watched your show a bunch of times reached out to you on Instagram.
*  What's up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But the way you do it and the way I do it is I think that's why it's interesting because I can tell like when you're talking to that guy that was talking about the direct energy weapons in Antarctica all that crazy shit like you wanted to hear what the guy had to say.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you know this is why he was on there.
*  You know this isn't like some producers told you the list of guests are you going to have for the week and you're not really interested in it and you got to interview some fucking kid in a boy band.
*  You know I can't do it.
*  Yeah I can't do it.
*  I'd like no reason to do it.
*  Yeah.
*  You know when I when I started I was we started in the attic it was me and my wife with these shit cameras that had like 30 minute timer.
*  So I was Mike Glover was my first guest and so my wife was like running back and forth resetting these 30 minute fucking timer cameras and I'm trying to run the sound and listen to what the hell Mike's saying and I'm like this fucking awesome.
*  For a long time.
*  What year did you start.
*  I started first one got pumped out Christmas of 2019.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  I think you're a great example because a lot of people want to say that the podcast market is too saturated now.
*  Like I've heard people say that it's too hard to make in the podcast market.
*  I'm like I don't believe that.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't believe that.
*  I think if you got a good show it's going to rise.
*  Same here.
*  And that's you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Well I studied the hell out of your show and when I was doing it and and you know I wanted to I just wanted to make it different.
*  I didn't want to copy the red curtain and you know what I mean.
*  And you made it yours.
*  Yeah you really did.
*  And it's that's the great thing about this and we need more voices like yours out there more different people that are doing the same kind of thing you know following their own interests talking to people honestly having these long term long form podcasts like the one with the guy studying the UFOs.
*  I think that's like four and a half hours long right.
*  Which one.
*  Is it.
*  What's his name John Alexander.
*  Yeah I did one that was like nine hours.
*  Yeah John Alexander this one is how long is this one.
*  Let me check.
*  Let's say resume six hours.
*  Six hours.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah it's six hours in a couple of minutes.
*  Yeah.
*  Have you talked to this guy about paranormal programs in the government.
*  I don't want to let him go.
*  It was amazing.
*  It's crazy stuff man.
*  Thank you.
*  Well listen Sean it was great to meet you.
*  I really appreciate you.
*  I appreciate what you're doing.
