# Joe Rogan Experience #1963 - Michael Shellenberger
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6.0s)]
*  Hello Michael. Good to see you again. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=12.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me back. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=14.0s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=15.0s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=16.0s)]
*  So, first of all, what was it like to get a hold of the Twitter files? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=17.0s)]
*  What was that experience like? How did that go down? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=24.0s)]
*  Exciting as hell, man. I mean, seriously. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=27.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of misinformation about that itself, but Barry Weiss contacted me. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=30.0s)]
*  She lives in LA and she got in and she's like, how soon can you get over here? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=36.0s)]
*  And I was like, let me finish this interview I'm on and I'm over. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=39.0s)]
*  And yeah, it was incredible. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=43.0s)]
*  You know, I'd never met Elon before. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=46.0s)]
*  You know, I'd met him at the coffee station just making himself a cup of coffee. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=48.0s)]
*  He had no idea who I was. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=51.0s)]
*  And yeah, we just got into it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=53.0s)]
*  It was a, you know, I was sort of the least known of the big three journalists that were there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=55.0s)]
*  It was Barry Weiss and Matt Taibbi who was on. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=61.0s)]
*  And they'd already started thinking about how to kind of what to go after. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=64.0s)]
*  And Matt had done a story on the Hunter Biden laptop already. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=67.0s)]
*  And then we were starting to look at January 6th because Trump gets deplatformed on January 8th. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=72.0s)]
*  And so because I'm like the junior member of that threesome, so to speak, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=78.0s)]
*  they gave me January 7th. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=82.0s)]
*  So the first thing we, one of the first things we did was just to look at how they made a decision to get to pull Trump off the platform. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=85.0s)]
*  And it turned out that the seventh was an important day because that was when they started to rationalize this decision to deplatform Trump, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=91.0s)]
*  even though their own people inside had decided that he had not violated their terms of service. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=98.0s)]
*  So they were sort of stuck making up a reason to deplatform him. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=103.0s)]
*  And that was an important theme was that they just kept changing the rules basically to do what they wanted to do. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=107.0s)]
*  And that was the same thing on the Hunter Biden laptop. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=113.0s)]
*  The New York Post story that they censored also had not violated their terms of service. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=115.0s)]
*  So, I mean, look, it was crazy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=121.0s)]
*  I mean, it was, you know, there's people always ask questions about the about the files themselves. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=122.0s)]
*  But, you know, the experience was we would ask for these searches and we just get back huge amounts of data. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=127.0s)]
*  It was lots of thousands and thousands of emails, thousands of internal messages on their Slack messaging system. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=133.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, I mean, a lot of it was, you know, some of it was very boring because you have to just read tons and tons of stuff. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=140.0s)]
*  But, you know, we I think the big theme was we start by seeing a real super progressive. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=145.0s)]
*  It's like 99 percent of campaign contributions from Twitter staff are going to Democrats. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=152.0s)]
*  You know, the head of safety at Twitter, this guy named Yul Roth, who, you know, said, you know, said there's actual Nazis in the White House when Trump came in, he was very progressive. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=157.0s)]
*  But over time, we just kept finding like this weird like FBI wants us to do this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=168.0s)]
*  You know, there's these other government agencies. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=173.0s)]
*  Oh, you know, this all these people used to work at the FBI. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=175.0s)]
*  The CIA shows up, Department of Homeland Security, and we're kind of like, what the hell is going on? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=179.0s)]
*  And the story quickly shifted from us sort of and I think what Elon thought, which was that it was just very progressive people being biased in their content moderation and their censoring to there is a huge operation by U.S. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=183.0s)]
*  government officials, U.S. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=198.0s)]
*  government contractors and all of these super sketchy NGOs getting money from who knows where basically demanding that Twitter start censoring people. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=200.0s)]
*  And at that moment, the story shifted for all of us. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=210.0s)]
*  And that was, I think, where Taibbi became particularly important and sort of the lead because he had had so much experience on sort of looking at how the U.S. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=213.0s)]
*  government during the war on terror had waged disinformation campaigns, propaganda campaigns, and it became clear to us, you know, over time that the U.S. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=221.0s)]
*  government had turned its propaganda and disinformation campaigns that had been waging abroad. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=231.0s)]
*  It turned them against the American people. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=238.0s)]
*  And that was where you just sort of get chills up your spine and you were like this something seriously sinister is going on. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=240.0s)]
*  Do we know when this began? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=247.0s)]
*  Like, when did they infiltrate these organizations? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=250.0s)]
*  Because I'm sure it's not just Twitter, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=253.0s)]
*  I'm sure it's. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=255.0s)]
*  Oh, no, absolutely not. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=257.0s)]
*  That's part of what was so terrifying is that it was all of the social media companies, including Wikipedia, by the way, which we don't talk enough about, but also all of the mainstream news organizations are all being organized. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=258.0s)]
*  So when does it start? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=270.0s)]
*  You know, it really what you're looking at is the apparatus that was created by the war on terror over the last 20 years, starting after 9 11. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=272.0s)]
*  Then there was a battle against ISIS because ISIS was successfully recruiting on social media. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=280.0s)]
*  So there was sort of a counter ISIS recruiting campaign that occurred. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=285.0s)]
*  Then you get the big event is Brexit 2016 Trump's election in 2016 and the establishment just freaks out. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=288.0s)]
*  Absolutely freaks out. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=297.0s)]
*  And they there's a lot of different motivations here. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=299.0s)]
*  So one of the motivations is just to blame Facebook, blame social media for Trump's victory. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=301.0s)]
*  It was never true. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=307.0s)]
*  I don't really think anybody really believed it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=309.0s)]
*  There's just, you know, it just there was just for a variety of reasons we can talk about. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=311.0s)]
*  There was never any good evidence that whatever Russians did had much of any influence, any measurable influence on the outcome of the campaign. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=315.0s)]
*  But they started to scapegoat the social media companies as a way to get control over them. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=324.0s)]
*  And so then they started then in 2017, they set up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=330.0s)]
*  Well, two things happen. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=332.0s)]
*  Many things happen. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=333.0s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security just declares election infrastructure to be part of their mission of protecting election infrastructure and then protecting the media environment. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=334.0s)]
*  Protecting. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=346.0s)]
*  Put it that in quotes. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=347.0s)]
*  You know, it's creepy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=349.0s)]
*  It's patronizing. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=350.0s)]
*  It's a power move. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=352.0s)]
*  So that's the first thing that happens. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=354.0s)]
*  They create something called the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency within the Department of Homeland Security to supposedly protect the media environment from foreign influence. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=356.0s)]
*  They create something called the Foreign Influence Task Force with the FBI to basically start policing domestic speech on these platforms. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=370.0s)]
*  They start organizing all the social media companies to participate in these meetings. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=379.0s)]
*  So you had Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, in here, and he says to you, there's this critical moment where you ask about the Hunter Biden laptop. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=382.0s)]
*  And he goes, well, yeah, you know, in the summer of 2020, all these FBI guys come to us saying there's going to be a hack and leak operation involving Hunter Biden, which is super suspicious because, as everybody now knows, the FBI had Hunter Biden's laptop in December 2019. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=390.0s)]
*  What freaked me out, and I was, I had, so by the way, I was a victim of the Hunter Biden laptop disinformation. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=410.0s)]
*  I thought that, I voted for Biden. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=416.0s)]
*  I thought that it was, I thought that that laptop was Russian disinformation. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=418.0s)]
*  I just bought the whole thing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=422.0s)]
*  And this is from somebody who... [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=423.0s)]
*  You're a journalist. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=425.0s)]
*  I'm supposedly a journalist, right? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=426.0s)]
*  So-called journalist. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=429.0s)]
*  I bought it. You know, I'm still a big liberal in so many ways. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=431.0s)]
*  And everybody I knew was like, oh, you know, besides Trump, it was just he's so, for all the reasons that progressives bought that the laptop was fake, I bought that it was fake. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=434.0s)]
*  So then when you realize that it was real and that everything in that New York Post story on October 14th, 2020 was accurate, I started seeing stuff in the emails. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=442.0s)]
*  The thing that really freaked me out was this thing that Aspen Institute, a call, it's called tabletop exercise, and it was actually a Zoom call to roleplay how to deal with Russian hack and leak around Hunter Biden. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=453.0s)]
*  This is like in June of 2020. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=468.0s)]
*  So this is like months before the New York, before, months before Rudy Giuliani gets that laptop, the laptop, but before Rudy Giuliani gives the laptop to New York Post. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=470.0s)]
*  Why in the hell is Aspen Institute holding a tabletop exercise to pre-bonk? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=480.0s)]
*  Basically, they are training or brainwashing all these journalists. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=484.0s)]
*  I mean, it's CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, Wikimedia Foundation, the Wikipedia folks, the networks, all of the social media companies all coming together to be like, OK, well, if something is, if something is leaked, then we should not cover it in the way that journalists have traditionally covered it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=488.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Stanford University, a few, a few months earlier, had put out a report saying reporters should no longer follow the Pentagon Papers principle. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=509.0s)]
*  Well, the Pentagon Papers, of course, is this famous episode. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=519.0s)]
*  It was Steven Spielberg made a whole movie about it where the Washington Post and New York Times published these internal Pentagon documents showing that the U.S. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=522.0s)]
*  government was losing the war in Vietnam. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=531.0s)]
*  Right. This is Daniel Ellsberg. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=533.0s)]
*  And he just releases it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=534.0s)]
*  He steals these documents. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=535.0s)]
*  He breaks the law, steals these documents, gives them to the newspapers, the newspapers publish them. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=536.0s)]
*  It's this kind of incredible moment in American journalism where we are like the First Amendment gives these newspapers the right to publish hacked, so-called hacked, but leaked information. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=541.0s)]
*  And here you have Stanford University, Aspen Institute saying, oh, no, no, no, that's all. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=553.0s)]
*  We should stop doing that. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=558.0s)]
*  Journalists should no longer write about leaked information in that way. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=559.0s)]
*  Instead, we should focus on the person who leaked it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=563.0s)]
*  So it's it really sent chills on my spine. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=566.0s)]
*  You know, it was the creepiest thing I'd ever seen. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=569.0s)]
*  And this is, of course, you got to remember Aspen Institute is funded by the U.S. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=572.0s)]
*  government. Stanford is funded by the U.S. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=575.0s)]
*  government. So this is people go, oh, well, you're just one of the responses we've got is, oh, you're just talking about, you know, content moderation by private companies. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=577.0s)]
*  No, we're talking about U.S. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=584.0s)]
*  government funded organizations. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=586.0s)]
*  You can't if the U.S. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=589.0s)]
*  government is censoring information, that's obviously a violation of First Amendment. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=591.0s)]
*  But if the U.S. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=594.0s)]
*  government is funding somebody else to censor information, that's also a violation of the First Amendment. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=595.0s)]
*  You can't indirectly. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=599.0s)]
*  It's still a violation if you're if you're funding somebody to demand censorship. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=601.0s)]
*  So it was quite a steeplechase. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=605.0s)]
*  But there's a lot here. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=607.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a lot a lot of people, a lot of institutions, a lot to unpack. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=608.0s)]
*  And that was part of the reason I wanted to reach out and be like, we just I needed Joe Rogan session to just kind of go through it all. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=611.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'm very happy to provide that. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=616.0s)]
*  Here's the question. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=618.0s)]
*  The obviously the laptop would harm the 100 Biden laptop would harm Joe Biden, obviously. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=620.0s)]
*  And if that story got out, who knows how many people would have voted the other way? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=629.0s)]
*  Is this a direct result of the things that Trump said when he was in office that went against the intelligence community? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=633.0s)]
*  Like, how did they decide? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=641.0s)]
*  I would always assume that, you know, the so-called deep state is essentially a bipartisan, that they wouldn't necessarily side with the Democrats or the Republicans. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=643.0s)]
*  They're really, you know, they're just in charge of they're supposed to be gathering information to protect the country. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=654.0s)]
*  So how did they decide specifically to either either stop information or propagate misinformation that would aid Joe Biden? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=662.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yes, that is exactly the right question. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=674.0s)]
*  So, I mean, I think the thing you have to understand is that that Trump was viewed by the deep state, by, you know, CIA, FBI, Pentagon, and all of the elites. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=679.0s)]
*  And this and you're right, is bipartisan in the sense that it's both never Trump Republicans and Democrats. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=692.0s)]
*  What freaked them out the most about Trump is that he was threatening to pull the US out of NATO. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=698.0s)]
*  I don't think that that was I just think that was bluster. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=704.0s)]
*  Like, that's insane. Again, by the way, I should say I actually I support what we call the Western Alliance. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=707.0s)]
*  I support providing military security for our allies in Asia and in Europe. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=713.0s)]
*  I'm not a I mean, there's parts of economic nationalism that I respect, but I'm also I don't I don't think we should pull out of NATO. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=718.0s)]
*  I think NATO has provided peace in the world and mostly been a good thing. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=726.0s)]
*  It's obviously had some crazy abuses like Iraq. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=730.0s)]
*  This whole experience has made me rethink my support for for Ukraine. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=733.0s)]
*  But I think it's important to understand that Trump terrified the deep state and the national security establishment. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=737.0s)]
*  So did Brexit. There's a sense in which you had a guy on here named Peter Zion who wrote this book called this really apocalyptic book about how the world is going to fall apart. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=744.0s)]
*  And his whole argument, which I don't agree with, I think he's brilliant, but the book is I think the argument is wrong. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=753.0s)]
*  His whole argument is based on the idea that the United States is going to stop providing military security to our allies in Asia and Europe. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=758.0s)]
*  It's all just based on this assumption that Trump is the beginning of some the U.S. withdrawing from its traditional role since World War Two. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=764.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of people who obviously their their ideology, their their livelihoods, their identity, just their whole way of life is tied up with providing the United States, providing this protection for Europe and Asia. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=772.0s)]
*  And they viewed Trump as threatening that. I also think they just really hated the guy. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=786.0s)]
*  They looked down on him. He's crude and all the things that that people don't like about him. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=791.0s)]
*  And he spoke disparagingly about the intelligence community. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=796.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he was crazy. Absolutely. He was against the war in Iraq. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=800.0s)]
*  He was a different he was a nationalist Republican. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=803.0s)]
*  And what's so interesting is that, you know, if you read people like, you know, people on the left like Noam Chomsky and others who have been critics of U.S. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=808.0s)]
*  or Glenn Greenwald, who are critics of or and I think Matt Taibbi critics of U.S. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=816.0s)]
*  government, you know, military invasions around the world since World War Two. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=820.0s)]
*  I mean, we've overthrown many governments, right? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=825.0s)]
*  Iran, Chile, Guatemala, you know, and what the pattern is, is that these are places where nationalists, sometimes socialists, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=829.0s)]
*  but often just nationalists who are trying to control their economies and they didn't want foreign interference, were coming to power. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=839.0s)]
*  And the U.S. government would see that as a threat to providing, you know, having this this liberal global order, as it's called. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=845.0s)]
*  And so they saw what they saw Trump as an existential threat to this postwar liberal order. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=853.0s)]
*  And they needed to and they viewed social media as the means to his power, which I think was exaggerated. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=860.0s)]
*  So on the one hand, they saw a threat. I think they also saw an opportunity. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=867.0s)]
*  You know, the war on terror, we won. I mean, like, it's just I mean, huge, huge victory. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=871.0s)]
*  I mean, it's shocking how successful it was in some ways. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=876.0s)]
*  So you have a bunch of people that suddenly need something to do. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=879.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of motivations there. And then you also have the guys that lost the Hillary campaign, John Podesta, who's the chair of her campaign. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=883.0s)]
*  He runs the most powerful progressive, frankly, propaganda organization in the world, or at least in the United States, the Center for American Progress. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=890.0s)]
*  They were looking also for some reason, someone to blame for their own failures, you know, for the dislikability of Hillary. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=899.0s)]
*  And so there was just a lot of motivations to try to get control over social media platforms. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=907.0s)]
*  They felt like they had lost control of them. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=913.0s)]
*  And what was the attitude of these social media platforms when they were exchanging emails back and forth with these intelligence agencies? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=915.0s)]
*  Was there any understanding of the implications of allowing this web of influence to infiltrate and control narratives and how kind of creepy and dangerous that is? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=926.0s)]
*  Did they understand how other people would perceive that? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=940.0s)]
*  Because I would assume this is all the emails were exchanged and there was slack messages and all this stuff is recorded. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=943.0s)]
*  Right. So it's there's there's a record of it. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=952.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=954.0s)]
*  Did they have an understanding of how other people would view this? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=955.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, just to back up even further. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=958.0s)]
*  So there's two interesting dynamics going on. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=960.0s)]
*  You know, the first is that the Internet itself is created by the U.S. Department of Defense and and Google is a spin off of Defense Department projects. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=963.0s)]
*  You know, so on the one hand, the Internet is a function of the U.S. military. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=972.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a spin off of the U.S. military. It's a great one. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=978.0s)]
*  We're glad to have it. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=980.0s)]
*  But but I think the U.S. military and the deep state and whatever, they felt like they had control over the Internet until Trump basically, or really maybe until ISIS around 2014, 2015. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=981.0s)]
*  That's the first dynamic. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=992.0s)]
*  The second dynamic is culturally Silicon Valley is libertarian. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=993.0s)]
*  Right. So you have the Electronic Freedom Foundation. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=997.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=999.0s)]
*  Electronic Frontier Foundation. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1000.0s)]
*  You have a libertarian ethos. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1002.0s)]
*  Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, is very much a manifestation of that libertarian ethos. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1004.0s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg less. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1011.0s)]
*  But but even Mark Zuckerberg after the 2016 elections, when everyone's accusing him of throwing the election to Trump, he's like, this is ridiculous. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1013.0s)]
*  He's like, our own data doesn't doesn't support. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1019.0s)]
*  There just wasn't enough. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1022.0s)]
*  The Russians clearly did not have this influence. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1023.0s)]
*  They just beat the crap out of him so much and threatened to take away their ability to operate, which is known as Section 230, which is this huge liability protection in the law passed in 1996, which allows Google, Facebook, Twitter to exist. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1027.0s)]
*  Can I stop you there? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1041.0s)]
*  You say they threatened to take it in what way? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1042.0s)]
*  Directly. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1046.0s)]
*  I mean, including Biden himself. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1047.0s)]
*  I mean, but basically, Democratic politicians, they would just say, you know, we're going to we're going to remove your Section 230 status. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1049.0s)]
*  That's just like saying we're going to destroy your company. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1056.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's not. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1059.0s)]
*  And they were saying this because they were their assertion was that Russian disinformation and propaganda led to Donald Trump being being elected. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1060.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1071.0s)]
*  Being elected. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1072.0s)]
*  And there was no evidence of this. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1073.0s)]
*  No, I mean, they there was I mean, there was some evidence of it, but nothing. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1075.0s)]
*  Well, there was certainly evidence of like these troll farms. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1080.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1085.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1086.0s)]
*  We know they exist. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1087.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1088.0s)]
*  But it's it's trivial. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1089.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1090.0s)]
*  I mean, it was they would exaggerate. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1091.0s)]
*  They would say things like, you know, 140, I think 146 million Americans had Russian propaganda in their news feeds. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1092.0s)]
*  That's not the same as saying 146 million people saw the ads. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1099.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1103.0s)]
*  Because it's like your feed is memory. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1104.0s)]
*  That was social. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1105.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1106.0s)]
*  Facebook has changed. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1107.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, there's there's I mean, look, there's three big disinformation campaigns that were run by, frankly, the U.S. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1108.0s)]
*  government and their allies. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1116.0s)]
*  The first was the Russia hoax. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1118.0s)]
*  The idea that Russians that Russians controlled Donald Trump and won him the election. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1120.0s)]
*  The second was the Hunter Biden laptop. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1126.0s)]
*  And the third is that covid origin, you know, the idea that that it's a conspiracy theory to even imagine that covid could have emerged from a lab. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1129.0s)]
*  There's others, including, you know, we can talk about there's a there was this effort to basically smear a bunch of ordinary conservative or Trump supporting Twitter users as Russian bots. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1138.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1150.0s)]
*  But but basically you have active disinformation campaigns being run by the U.S. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1152.0s)]
*  government, U.S. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1156.0s)]
*  government contractors against the American people on these issues at the same time that they're demanding censorship. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1157.0s)]
*  So you have propaganda on the one hand and censorship on the other. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1163.0s)]
*  Well, here's what appears to be dangerous to me. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1166.0s)]
*  There doesn't seem to be any repercussions for doing these things. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1168.0s)]
*  This is scary because it's shifting in there. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1173.0s)]
*  So in step one, the Hunter Biden laptop over example one rather the Hunter Biden laptop, no one's in trouble. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1175.0s)]
*  Right. No, no one's in trouble. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1185.0s)]
*  No one from the FBI is in trouble. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1187.0s)]
*  No one loses their job. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1188.0s)]
*  No one gets reprimanded. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1189.0s)]
*  No one gets, you know, brought before the American people and said, you failed us. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1191.0s)]
*  Not only did you fail us, you betrayed us because you knew this was not true. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1196.0s)]
*  And you allowed someone whose son has deep ties to both Ukrainian and Chinese companies that were paying him for influence. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1200.0s)]
*  And it appears at least by some of these emails that some of that money went to the actual vice president of the United States, which is fucking wild that no one is. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1212.0s)]
*  And then the crazy thing is one of the things about having a right and a left is that whenever this information that's inconveniently bad for that one side, particularly the left, you don't hear a fucking peep about it on the media. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1226.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1245.0s)]
*  It's it's dismissed. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1246.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, they'll they'll talk about it like what someone said. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1248.0s)]
*  Someone talked about the Hunter Biden laptop and said it was like half fake. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1255.0s)]
*  That was like a AOC. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1260.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1262.0s)]
*  What is that is a that is such a horrible violation of the trust that the people who elected you put in you. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1263.0s)]
*  You have access to all the information. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1274.0s)]
*  You have access to that actual fucking laptop. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1278.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. By the way, I have access to it, too. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1281.0s)]
*  Yeah. A lot of people have access to it. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1283.0s)]
*  If you wanted to. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1285.0s)]
*  I said, I don't want to look at it. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1286.0s)]
*  I was like, I don't want to look at that fucking thing. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1288.0s)]
*  I don't want to see this guy getting foot jobs from hookers in Vietnam, smoking street crack. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1289.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1293.0s)]
*  Whatever he did. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1294.0s)]
*  But the fact that someone would say that's half fake. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1295.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1298.0s)]
*  That itself is disinformation. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1299.0s)]
*  It seems important. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1300.0s)]
*  That's that. That is a lie. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1301.0s)]
*  It's a lie. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1302.0s)]
*  It's disinformation. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1303.0s)]
*  But you're just saying it because if you can say it's half fake, all you muddy the water. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1304.0s)]
*  And now anybody that's looking at that could go, oh, yeah, but that's half fake. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1310.0s)]
*  According to my side. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1315.0s)]
*  This is like the same people. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1317.0s)]
*  There's still people that say that Trump was in bed with the Russians, which is how he won in 2016. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1318.0s)]
*  People that still parrot that. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1325.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1326.0s)]
*  Very close friends and family. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1328.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1330.0s)]
*  Say that. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1331.0s)]
*  I was happy to do your show because literally like even my very close friends and family don't understand what I'm talking about. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1332.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I want to go on Joe Rogan and just unpack this for them to how serious this is. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1339.0s)]
*  I mean, you have to remember the New York. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1344.0s)]
*  I mean, and I'll put on myself. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1346.0s)]
*  I was so biased. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1347.0s)]
*  The New York Post published the subpoena, which is a kind of receipt from the FBI showing they had taken Hunter Biden's laptop from this computer repair store owner in Delaware. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1348.0s)]
*  It was published in the New York Post. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1360.0s)]
*  They also published the receipt that has Hunter Biden's signature on it, saying that he had not only had left the laptop there, but also that it gave the computer store, the computer repair owner the rights to it if he abandoned it. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1361.0s)]
*  Hunter Biden never said it wasn't his. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1374.0s)]
*  He never denied that it was his laptop. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1377.0s)]
*  Well, and subsequently, at least recently, he sued that guy for releasing the information, which is the dumbest thing he could have ever done. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1379.0s)]
*  Because now all this half fake shit gets thrown out the window. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1387.0s)]
*  Now it's he's saying it's his. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1391.0s)]
*  Right. Well, they they're always there. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1393.0s)]
*  Look, there I mean, I think the other thing I want to also emphasize here, because I think that when you uncover the level of coordination and the sophistication of the disinformation and censorship campaign, it's easy to also sort of say they're perfect, but they're not. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1395.0s)]
*  They're always making stuff up as they're going along. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1408.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1410.0s)]
*  The other interesting thing that's important to know here about that laptop story is that within Twitter, they look at that New York Post article. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1411.0s)]
*  Yol Roth, the head of safety, and his team, they look at and they go, yeah, I mean, it's legit. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1420.0s)]
*  It doesn't violate our internal, it doesn't violate our terms of service. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1425.0s)]
*  And at that moment, I mean, it has a Manchurian quality, Manchurian can't quality to it, where the former chief legal counsel to FBI guy named Jim Baker, who is central to beginning the Russiagate probe of Trump. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1431.0s)]
*  He's now at Twitter as deputy general counsel. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1446.0s)]
*  This is what we're discovering. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1449.0s)]
*  This is probably what I was discovering in the Twitter files is just vociferously attacking this thing is like this looks like misinformation, disinformation. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1450.0s)]
*  We shouldn't trust it looks like it violates Twitter's policies. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1459.0s)]
*  He was he just I mean, like multiple I think it was at least four messages and emails of him pushing to the executives. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1462.0s)]
*  Then of course, it doesn't we can't see the phone calls that which is really where a lot of the dirty work happens. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1469.0s)]
*  Pushing to just get this thing censored by by Twitter. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1474.0s)]
*  Sure enough, a few a few hours later, Yol Roth says, well, OK, you know, we think that it could very well have been a Russian hack or somehow they put the I mean, it was this crazy thing where they like, well, we think it was hacked and then put on the laptop. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1479.0s)]
*  It was just bizarre. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1494.0s)]
*  You'll Roth like on there's moments where I respect him because he was he was enough of a truth teller internally. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1496.0s)]
*  It's why he got to the position he was in, which is a very powerful position to be like, hey, this is bullshit. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1502.0s)]
*  Like internally, he would say, but he was also a company man. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1507.0s)]
*  So when his when powerful superiors in the organization, including former FBI people and Jim Baker wasn't the only one when he gets worked, he just bends. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1510.0s)]
*  And he just was like, OK, yeah, I think we've decided that it violates our hacked materials policy and we're going to censor it. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1520.0s)]
*  The other thing I want to point out about this, it's not just that they censored the article because people always go, well, you know, they it only lasted for a few days or whatever. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1526.0s)]
*  It was the discrediting of it. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1535.0s)]
*  The censoring censorship is a disinformation strategy. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1538.0s)]
*  If you censor that article, in other words, Twitter and Facebook, all the headlines where Twitter and Facebook are, you know, they're going to restrict the dissemination of this material or they think it's, you know, that's that all that publicity is really what matters. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1542.0s)]
*  So in terms of like, you know, in my defense and other people that bought the idea that it was somehow a fake, we were being told by the media that everybody had looked at this and was kind of like, look, it looks like it's hacked. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1556.0s)]
*  And there's something there's something funny about it. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1567.0s)]
*  So I think that, you know, I think that there's so many shocking things about it, but I think it's the the level of coordination and conformity within these social media companies. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1570.0s)]
*  It was the pre-bunking in advance and it was the complete total, you know, just the complete news media blackout and unanimity that there was and it was just all of them. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1581.0s)]
*  I mean, it was like all the networks, all the newspapers, they all just repeated this idea that there was something wrong about the laptop and there wasn't. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1596.0s)]
*  It's so creepy. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1603.0s)]
*  And it's so creepy that there's no repercussions. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1604.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's essentially lying and using taxpayer dollars to promote propaganda that they know to be untrue. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1607.0s)]
*  But there is a chance. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1617.0s)]
*  I mean, so we do the attorneys general of Louisiana, Louisiana and Missouri are moving forward in the courts in suing the ensuing the Biden administration for violating the First Amendment. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1618.0s)]
*  You know, this is of course this hunter buying laptop. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1632.0s)]
*  This is one of many things. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1634.0s)]
*  I mean, the other craziest thing of all, maybe some of the most crazy stuff of all is that Facebook censored accurate COVID vaccine side effects information because it didn't want to promote vaccine hesitancy. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1636.0s)]
*  And there was the White House is like just pressuring them. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1650.0s)]
*  I mean, there's guy Andy Slavin in particular is just this malign actor just pressuring, pressuring, threatening them. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1652.0s)]
*  They're nasty in these emails. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1658.0s)]
*  The White House nasty. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1660.0s)]
*  In what way? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1661.0s)]
*  Oh, just just being just just basically, you know, it's a continuing Biden does it publicly. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1662.0s)]
*  So they're killing people. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1669.0s)]
*  They're basically accusing people of I mean, these guys, they don't like gloves are off. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1670.0s)]
*  I mean, they're just like you're killing people by letting this information out. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1675.0s)]
*  I mean, the information is people telling their own story of vaccine side effects. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1677.0s)]
*  We always point out like it was one of the great public interest progressive victories in recent memory that the drug companies have to name the side effects of their drugs in their TV ads. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1682.0s)]
*  Yeah, like that's a big part of it, right? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1693.0s)]
*  It's like a running joke. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1695.0s)]
*  You have to name the side effects in the TV ads. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1696.0s)]
*  Well, here they like here were ordinary people trying to tell stories of the side effects that they had from the vaccine on Facebook and Twitter. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1699.0s)]
*  And the White House is demanding that Facebook and Twitter censored that stuff. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1706.0s)]
*  This is the this is just the worst. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1710.0s)]
*  I mean, that is I mean, that's just Soviet Chinese style censorship, like full on. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1713.0s)]
*  I mean, so it's not over. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1718.0s)]
*  And I think that, you know, we've already seen there's other things going on, like that agency I mentioned that cyber that part of the Department of Homeland Security, the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency, they changed their website over the last few months to remove references to domestic counter disinformation. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1720.0s)]
*  They changed their disinformation efforts to emphasize countering foreign disinformation. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1739.0s)]
*  They, you know, we talk a lot about this. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1745.0s)]
*  There's one of the big leaders of the censorship industrial complex is this person named Renee de Resta at Stanford Internet Observatory. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1748.0s)]
*  Yeah, let's talk about that, because I had her on and what she essentially was talking about was all these Russian troll farms and how interesting it is that they created all these funny memes and they used all these resources to create these things. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1755.0s)]
*  All these resources to try to shift the narrative and change public opinion on certain things and that it was very effective. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1768.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, so let's just let's start with Renee. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1775.0s)]
*  Yeah. So first of all, Renee is somebody who I only I came across because she's actually kind of moderate on a bunch of stuff that I'm moderate on, like dealing with homelessness on COVID. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1778.0s)]
*  She's actually like a moderate voice. She's not super woke or anything, and she's critical of like she moved out of San Francisco because it's just too crazy. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1790.0s)]
*  She so she and I had this conversation like we were talking about this even before I started talking to her right when I started looking at the Twitter files and we did this long interview. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1799.0s)]
*  I was on Sam Harris's podcast with her. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1807.0s)]
*  And then she starts showing up in the Twitter files and all these weird ways and we start looking into her. It's a very so she's also the reason we're she's so important is like, like when you read the, you know, when you when you follow the meetings or watch the YouTube videos wherever she's like one of the smartest people like there's something going on with her. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1810.0s)]
*  She's like a real leader. She's, she's always sort of the number two. The other thing about these people is that they move around a lot, they move in between organizations and she's always sort of the number two, but she always seems a bit smarter than the person that she's reporting to. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1826.0s)]
*  And so she's somebody that she goes to, she gets a computer science degree from State University of New York at Stony Brook, that happens to be a major recruiting place for the NSA. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1839.0s)]
*  She then goes and has she gets a job at Jane's Trading, which is like one of the great it's like up there with Goldman or maybe better it's where SPF from FTX was at. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1851.0s)]
*  She's there then she had a couple of companies that did like logistics and cyber very high powered successful executive. And then according to her story and the public story, she gets obsessed with anti vaxxers. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1862.0s)]
*  She's got young kids she's obsessed with anti vaxxers spreading anti vax misinformation is long before COVID. I think it's around 2014 2015. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1877.0s)]
*  You know, she's like advising President Obama on counter ISIS disinformation strategy in the White House and advising on the expansion of something called the global, the global education center which is part of the State Department of [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1886.0s)]
*  counter disinfo. So suddenly she's like, like the senior person. It's very suspicious, very rapid rise. If you know anything about those communities. They're very hierarchical and like you have to work your way up over many years she's instantly like at the top. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1901.0s)]
*  She in 2017. She is at a consulting firm called New Knowledge that is then caught doing disinformation against an Alabama Trumpian Republican candidate named Roy Moore. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1915.0s)]
*  They are caught doing fake Facebook pages accusing Roy Moore of wanting to basically restrict alcohol consumption in Alabama which is deeply unpopular position it was false and also creating the perception of Russian bots supporting Roy Moore. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1931.0s)]
*  Her firm runs that campaign. Afterwards, she sort of tries to distance herself from it suggests that she wasn't involved even though when you read the Washington Post and New York Times articles about her about that, about the scandal. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1950.0s)]
*  She sort of she makes it makes it clear that she was actually the person that brought the funding in to run the program and also kind of conceived a much of the strategy. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1964.0s)]
*  After that, she becomes the top researcher to the Senate Intelligence Report of 2018 on Russian disinformation in the 2016 election. So she's not not only is she not punished for her role in it. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1974.0s)]
*  She's rewarded by the Democrats with this incredibly powerful position. So she becomes like the lead witness, the lead author, first Senate Democrats, Adam Schiff in promoting the whole narrative that somehow Russians swung the election to Trump. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=1988.0s)]
*  And there's no repercussions for promoting this false information. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2002.0s)]
*  No, I mean she's rewarded for it. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2006.0s)]
*  And no one talks about it. It's never. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2008.0s)]
*  Well, I mean we're starting to write, but I mean I'll point out a couple other things. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2010.0s)]
*  But before the Twitter files, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you didn't even know. Right. So most people don't know. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2015.0s)]
*  No, there's one guy we discovered Matt Mataibe discovers them. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2021.0s)]
*  And only I only got an hour like whatever like a week or two before my testimony in Congress, which was a couple few weeks ago, not the one I did yesterday. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2026.0s)]
*  We discovered this this guy who was the head of cyber at the State Department, a senior guy named Mike Benz and he is like super deep into this stuff. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2035.0s)]
*  He's amazing. I highly recommend him coming on. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2047.0s)]
*  But he runs something he basically leaves State Department and starts something called the Foundation for Freedom Online. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2050.0s)]
*  And he has been documenting this more than anybody. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2056.0s)]
*  So he had it, but he's not he's just really in the weeds like it's really detailed. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2059.0s)]
*  You have to really it was hard to understand. You have to really go through it and unpack it. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2064.0s)]
*  I used a bunch of it in my testimony. I talked to him. I interviewed him a lot. But I mean, you know, basically a media blackout on all of this stuff. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2067.0s)]
*  Renee de Resta, who then moves from New Knowledge to Stanford Internet Observatory, that organization and three other organizations, Atlantic Council, Graphica and University of Washington has a think tank on this. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2075.0s)]
*  They get government funding and they run something called the Election Integrity Project in 2020 to basically demand censorship. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2089.0s)]
*  By the way, if I just read the Election Integrity Committee, I get super suspicious. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2097.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Just the name of that. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2102.0s)]
*  I mean, Joe, it's they they they basically would flag hundreds of millions of tweets. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2105.0s)]
*  I believe that their database they had they had over a billion social media posts, Facebook, Twitter, that they flagged and tens of millions of them were censored. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2113.0s)]
*  Are they running? That's insane. By the social media companies. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2124.0s)]
*  Are they running some sort of a program that allows them to find those tweets? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2127.0s)]
*  Yeah. You see it a lot. They do these maps. They have these maps where they just they they locate the super spreaders. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2131.0s)]
*  So like you and me would be super spreaders. Jordan, I'm in it. I mean, I'm they they attack me in this disinformation. This little these these sensors. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2139.0s)]
*  Really? They have reports they put like me, Jordan Peterson, Bjorn Lombor, you, Ty. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2149.0s)]
*  I mean, they put us in there. So anybody that has a social media, a big social media follower following, call us super spreaders. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2155.0s)]
*  And then they try to get us censored. And they did for me. They got Facebook to censor me. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2162.0s)]
*  How so? Well, they well, when my my book on the environment came out, Apocalypse Never, in 2020, I wrote an article that sort of summarized the book as one does. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2168.0s)]
*  It went super viral. It then one of these shady organizations attacked it not for anything being wrong with it, but for it being misleading. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2178.0s)]
*  They call it it's the same way that they attacked the vaccine side effects stuff. They go, well, you know, it's accurate. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2192.0s)]
*  It's true. But it leads people to draw the wrong conclusions. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2199.0s)]
*  The wrong conclusion being that climate change is real, but not the end of the world or vaccines. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2204.0s)]
*  The wrong conclusion would be maybe don't get the vaccine or maybe if you're, you know, whatever, under 18 or you're, you know, young man or 18 or if you've had whatever. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2210.0s)]
*  I mean, whatever it might be, you don't need to be triple vax. They they so they're basically using an opinion, which is you should get the vaccine or you should think of climate change as apocalyptic as a way to and then they kind of go to the back door and say anything. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2218.0s)]
*  That's being used to propagate that narrative should be counted as misinformation. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2233.0s)]
*  So she is so bitches to back up. So that so there's a little cluster of the censorship industrial complex. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2237.0s)]
*  Does this quote unquote election integrity project in 2020 they censor tens of millions of social media posts and by sensor. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2245.0s)]
*  Do you mean they remove them? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2254.0s)]
*  So by sensor where I'm going to use the definition that everybody uses, which is it's you can remove, you can reduce or you can they called inform. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2257.0s)]
*  You can put a flag on it. That's what they do. Everything I do for Facebook now. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2268.0s)]
*  Almost everything I do has a warning on it. You know, here's how to get accurate information about climate change. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2272.0s)]
*  Go to the Facebook Climate Change Center. Even my stuff on homelessness and drugs. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2277.0s)]
*  They'll be like, here's how to get accurate. That's how you know that I'm I've got I'm on some list. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2281.0s)]
*  I'm on some blacklist and Facebook. So yeah, so it's those three things. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2286.0s)]
*  Those are all forms of censorship. Those these groups, which are U.S. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2290.0s)]
*  government funded organizations, this is very important to stress. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2295.0s)]
*  This is not some private actors, U.S. government funded organizations pressuring the social media companies to censor these posts and these people. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2298.0s)]
*  And they do it in 2020. And then Renee, who does this little video, it's like one of the creepiest videos that we've discovered. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2307.0s)]
*  There's little videos that they do. She's sort of describing, you know, well, and then we realized that we needed to keep going on covid. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2314.0s)]
*  And so then in 2021, the election integrity project turns into something called the virality project. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2321.0s)]
*  And that's where they then go and wage censorship on covid information that they don't like. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2329.0s)]
*  I refuse to use their language. And again, it's tens of millions of people. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2335.0s)]
*  And it's so you see it at all levels. It's these guys doing it. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2339.0s)]
*  We say I like we the censorship industrial complex is the right, I think, description of what we're talking about. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2342.0s)]
*  It's a phrase that, of course, came from Dwight Eisenhower's famous farewell address that he gives. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2349.0s)]
*  He goes, look, you know, you got to worry the D.O.D. is funding all these private military contractors. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2355.0s)]
*  These private military contractors have a financial interest in war. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2359.0s)]
*  This is Eisenhower, the guy that won World War Two. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2363.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like Mr. Credible on this issue. And he was like this amazing, beautiful. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2366.0s)]
*  I mean, it's really the best of of what a president can be. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2370.0s)]
*  And he warns against this. It's the so it's this it's this complex. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2374.0s)]
*  It's this kind of clustering of government agencies and government funded groups. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2379.0s)]
*  So, you know, I mean, it's in the case of the censorship industrial complex, it's the Department of Defense. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2385.0s)]
*  It's the State Department. It's FBI. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2390.0s)]
*  It's CIA. It's Department of Homeland Security funding these so-called think tanks. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2393.0s)]
*  And there's sometimes there are universities or sometimes they're standalones. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2399.0s)]
*  Some of them are in Britain, by the way. There's a very special that special relationship with the U.S. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2402.0s)]
*  and Britain. Often the U.S. will the UK think tanks right now are attacking me, trying to discredit me. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2406.0s)]
*  So sometimes they'll go that way. They'll try to like attacking you. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2413.0s)]
*  Attacking you. How so? Well, they just put out a report. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2416.0s)]
*  These guys are the worst. They put out this like long report describing climate disinformation. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2420.0s)]
*  And like I was like, as soon as I opened up, I was like, fuck, I bet I'm in this. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2426.0s)]
*  And I just do like command F and I just Schellenberger. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2430.0s)]
*  And sure enough, it's like, like, whatever, like multiple results. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2433.0s)]
*  I'm like, crap, you know. And so they and they, you know, often these are reports that they don't get a lot of fanfare or whatever, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2436.0s)]
*  but they get they make sure that they get e-mailed to a bunch of journalists. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2442.0s)]
*  They talk to the journalists and they just they basically just emphasize never talk to this person, never quote this person, do not platform them. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2445.0s)]
*  We then, by the way, after our testimony, that same Stanford cluster, it's actually more than one group at Stanford even, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2453.0s)]
*  they e-mailed I'm not going to say who because I don't want to give away my sources, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2461.0s)]
*  but they've basically e-mailed many people about Matt and my testimony, trying to attack our testimony and sharing information. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2466.0s)]
*  So there's the creepiest. They creep around. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2473.0s)]
*  They're constantly they're constantly waging disinformation campaigns against disfavored voices while and demanding censorship, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2476.0s)]
*  while also spreading their own disinformation. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2483.0s)]
*  God, it's so creepy that this is that the people doing this don't understand how deeply un-American this is. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2486.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2492.0s)]
*  And that they feel like it's OK to do because the side that they're on is the right side. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2493.0s)]
*  You got it. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2500.0s)]
*  You got it. It's un-American. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2501.0s)]
*  It's so un-American. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2503.0s)]
*  I mean, Joe, it's funny because like I mean, so I graduated from high school in 1989. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2505.0s)]
*  I remember distinctly that that was the year that the Supreme Court upheld your right to burn a flag. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2509.0s)]
*  And I remember just being like, God damn, that's why I'm a Democrat. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2515.0s)]
*  That's why I'm a liberal. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2518.0s)]
*  Like, I think you should be able to burn a flag. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2520.0s)]
*  I think the First Amendment literally from that moment on, I have never worried about the First Amendment in the United States. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2522.0s)]
*  For me, it was like always kind of basic. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2527.0s)]
*  Like, like, like, come on, guys. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2530.0s)]
*  Like, it's the first it's the First Amendment. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2532.0s)]
*  Like, how could it possibly be under threat? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2533.0s)]
*  This was like one of the few times where because I don't spook super easily, but like reading this stuff, you're just like, this is scary. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2536.0s)]
*  It's so these people are scary. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2545.0s)]
*  And you may know, by the way, when Matt Taibbi and I were testifying before Congress a few weeks ago, the IRS agent shows up at Matt Taibbi's house in person. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2546.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2557.0s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2558.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal just wrote a piece about a few days ago. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2559.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm like, look, hey, you know, maybe it's a coincidence, whatever. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2562.0s)]
*  I was like just asking around people I know and people were like, no way. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2567.0s)]
*  Is that a coincidence? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2572.0s)]
*  So this is brazen. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2573.0s)]
*  These guys are trying to send a message. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2574.0s)]
*  They're trying to intimidate. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2576.0s)]
*  They want to ruin our I mean, they base it for me. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2578.0s)]
*  It's been years of just trying to survive, of, you know, just just trying to deplatform discredit, keep you off of off of out of newspapers, out of TV show, whatever podcasts. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2581.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, these guys are they're ruthless. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2593.0s)]
*  You know, the it's definitely a hall monitor mentality. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2597.0s)]
*  You know, like and it's elitist. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2601.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like Renee is a snob. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2604.0s)]
*  I'll just you know, she's I I agree with her on some things. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2607.0s)]
*  I'm sure she's a fine person in her personal life. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2610.0s)]
*  She's probably a good mother. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2613.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't have any, you know, I'm trying to try to be nice. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2614.0s)]
*  I'm trying to be Christian about this. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2618.0s)]
*  But I mean, they're snobs like they literally they I remember at one point I briefly asked her about climate change. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2620.0s)]
*  And we talked about the climate stuff and I could tell that she felt like she was actually probably an expert on that, too. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2626.0s)]
*  You know, it's like my book I spent 20 years of research going into my book. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2632.0s)]
*  Fine. Maybe I'm wrong. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2636.0s)]
*  But I mean, like you have journalists out there, Joe, like all these big publications, they're like 23 years old and they're like, I'm a disinformation expert. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2638.0s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine being like, I'm a truth expert, Joe. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2647.0s)]
*  I'm a truth expert. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2650.0s)]
*  That's really what it is. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2651.0s)]
*  You're a malign actor and a vector of disinformation, whereas I'm a truth expert. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2653.0s)]
*  So there's definitely that whole, you know, that Jordan Peterson talks about, which is like, I'm just pure and good. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2657.0s)]
*  And it's reinforced within the group. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2663.0s)]
*  Right. It's a very this is a very tribal thing. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2665.0s)]
*  You have these ideologies that these people subscribe to. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2667.0s)]
*  But it's it's so disturbing as a person, you know, who grew up liberal to see this from the left, this is hardcore censorship from the left and this support of government disinformation that's purely aligned with monetary reasons. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2671.0s)]
*  It's just about money. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2691.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the only reason why they would be doing this money and power money and power money and power and ideology. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2692.0s)]
*  And, you know, like I said, it's like, you know, it's not even I mean, I think mostly, like I said, the Western Alliance and NATO have brought peace, you know, since World War Two. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2699.0s)]
*  And I don't think we should be pulling out. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2708.0s)]
*  And, you know, honestly, the extent of I've rethought my position on Ukraine is just because of these nefarious actors. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2710.0s)]
*  Like, what are they really doing here? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2715.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, for sure, it's it's you know, it is what kind of we all have known it is, is you're trying to the US is is part of this empire. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2718.0s)]
*  And we're trying to make the world safe for Western capitalism and Western corporations. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2726.0s)]
*  And, you know, that's actually lifted a bunch of people out of poverty. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2730.0s)]
*  It's not totally negative. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2733.0s)]
*  But obviously, you also get the Iraq invasion, which was terrible, and the Afghanistan occupation, which resulted in horrors. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2734.0s)]
*  We also get some things that aren't beneficial to anybody. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2743.0s)]
*  If you're censoring information about the lab leak hypothesis, yeah, that's a real problem. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2745.0s)]
*  Because if we are still funding gain of function research or if we are funding it through a proxy. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2750.0s)]
*  Right. And they're denying this and lying about this and covering this up through emails. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2756.0s)]
*  And then when you find out that certain physicians and doctors change their testimony or change their opinion and then received enormous grants. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2761.0s)]
*  Yeah. This is this is like this is you're following a very obvious paper trail. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2771.0s)]
*  Let's let's let's can we let's spend a minute on this because this is crazy. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2777.0s)]
*  So and by the way, the New York Times finally ran a good story on this just yesterday and particularly around Fauci. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2781.0s)]
*  So Fauci, of course, famous for saying I am science. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2789.0s)]
*  Yeah. Let's just if you criticize Anthony Fauci, you're criticizing science. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2792.0s)]
*  It's I mean, first of all, it's a crazy thing for a human to say it's a crazy thing. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2800.0s)]
*  That is so first of all, the word science, I was thinking the other day, like it should just not be a noun. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2804.0s)]
*  Like science is a process. Yes. It's about it. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2809.0s)]
*  You should better word would be investigations or investigating. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2812.0s)]
*  I mean, just science. Yeah, it should be a science scene. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2816.0s)]
*  Yeah. When you say the science criticizing the silent. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2819.0s)]
*  We know you mean the data. Right. Like are you talking about data? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2821.0s)]
*  Well, science is a process, a process. And they say the science doesn't support it. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2825.0s)]
*  It's a religion. I mean, they're saying he's saying the truth, the religion. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2831.0s)]
*  I'm the holy priest in touch with God. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2834.0s)]
*  What's just ego? And it's so transparent that he can't even hide it. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2837.0s)]
*  Yes. Like it's it's it's pouring out of him. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2841.0s)]
*  And I think it's this is such an interesting case because so so the U.S. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2845.0s)]
*  government banned gain of function research. Yes. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2849.0s)]
*  In 2014. Right. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2852.0s)]
*  So when the Trump administration was in office, the N.I.H. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2854.0s)]
*  kept funding it. Yes. In China. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2859.0s)]
*  So and Fauci knew that he knew that. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2862.0s)]
*  And then but didn't that restart in 2016 or 17 when when Trump got into office? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2867.0s)]
*  I'm not sure the exact timeline. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2875.0s)]
*  You mean just sort of the Obama administration stopped the funding. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2877.0s)]
*  What I had would have been explained to me was that the Trump administration was so [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2881.0s)]
*  chaotic that the N.I.H. said, listen, let's just do this through the Eco Health [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2885.0s)]
*  Alliance and make it simple. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2891.0s)]
*  And that way we'll kind of like do it by proxy. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2893.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think the punch line, though, is that Fauci knew very well that gain of [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2896.0s)]
*  function research was not only occurring at the Wuhan lab, but that it was being [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2900.0s)]
*  funded by the U.S. government. Yeah. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2904.0s)]
*  And then they get on these conference calls and two of the main researchers, I [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2906.0s)]
*  believe they're both that from scripts. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2911.0s)]
*  They both go, yeah, I don't know. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2913.0s)]
*  Looks like it could have been manufactured from a lab and not from zoonotic spillover. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2915.0s)]
*  So so it's even more sinister than just being arrogant. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2920.0s)]
*  It's actually looks like a cover up. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2924.0s)]
*  It looks like a cover up and it looks like a cover up where the people covered it up [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2926.0s)]
*  were compensated. Oh, and not only that, but did you see I don't know if you saw [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2930.0s)]
*  this recent report where there's it looks like they were they were double dipping. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2933.0s)]
*  They were over they were double charging. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2938.0s)]
*  They were overcharging. So they were basically getting paid twice by U.S. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2940.0s)]
*  taxpayers. CBS News, which is like only one of the few mainstream media outlets has [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2946.0s)]
*  actually done a good job covering this. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2950.0s)]
*  They also covered the 100 buying laptop accurately belatedly, but they did. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2952.0s)]
*  Yeah. They wrote about how these contractors were were getting paid twice for the same [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2956.0s)]
*  work. So that's a way now to kind of get in there and try to figure out what's going [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2961.0s)]
*  on. You know, we're hoping to I mean, the crazy thing is that on the Twitter back to [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2965.0s)]
*  the Twitter files, because, you know, Elon is obsessed with Fauci and wants to have the [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2971.0s)]
*  Fauci files. But none of us have looked for this in the Twitter file. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2976.0s)]
*  Like literally nobody has yet even looked to see whether or not this covid origin stuff [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2979.0s)]
*  was being censored from within Twitter. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2984.0s)]
*  So we don't know yet. I mean, we've just been backed up and a lot of other stuff. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2986.0s)]
*  Wow. So this other stuff is so preoccupied all of your time that that so is that next on [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2989.0s)]
*  the agenda? I hope so. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2995.0s)]
*  I mean, I should just be proclaiming that publicly. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=2997.0s)]
*  No, it's I mean, you mean that we want to look for it? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3000.0s)]
*  No, I mean, Elon proclaimed it. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3003.0s)]
*  Yes. Elon promised the Fauci files. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3005.0s)]
*  Well, he literally said his pronouns are prosecute Fauci, which is wild. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3007.0s)]
*  Yeah, that wouldn't have been that way. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3013.0s)]
*  I would have I would have liked to do the Fauci files first and then make a judgment. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3015.0s)]
*  Well, the thing he's smart and what he's doing is he's he's like firing a shot across the bow [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3020.0s)]
*  and then causing people to scramble and reveal their intentions and reveal like what what [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3026.0s)]
*  they're trying to accomplish. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3033.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3035.0s)]
*  Like it's a chess move. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3036.0s)]
*  It's a good chess move because it gets people talking and then it gets people talking about [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3037.0s)]
*  Fauci. I have no idea what he is talking about. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3042.0s)]
*  It's just craziness. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3047.0s)]
*  Oh, it's craziness. Is it really? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3049.0s)]
*  Well, maybe someone's going to go look at AZT. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3051.0s)]
*  Maybe someone's going to go back and look at the way you guys handled the AIDS crisis. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3054.0s)]
*  Because if you look at Robert Kennedy Jr.'s book, The Real Anthony Fauci, if that book is [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3058.0s)]
*  accurate, I don't know if it's accurate. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3062.0s)]
*  I'm assuming he hasn't been sued yet. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3064.0s)]
*  It's a terrifying book. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3067.0s)]
*  When they talk about the AIDS crisis and what they it's it's essentially a version of what [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3069.0s)]
*  you're seeing now, but with no Internet, where they were allowed to do things with no [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3074.0s)]
*  investigative journalist, no social media outrage, no people posting different studies [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3079.0s)]
*  that contradict what they're saying. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3086.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's a wild book, man. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3089.0s)]
*  It's a wild book of unchecked power and influence and and also like an absolute disdain for what [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3092.0s)]
*  is beneficial to human life and the American people. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3099.0s)]
*  And instead, what is great for profit? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3103.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's it's an abuse of power. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3105.0s)]
*  You know, we had this crazy abuses of power, you know, under Nixon and during the Vietnam War, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3108.0s)]
*  late 60s or 70s. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3113.0s)]
*  We had we had a church. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3115.0s)]
*  We had this thing called the Church Committee hearings. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3116.0s)]
*  It was bipartisan. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3118.0s)]
*  It did result in a bunch of reforms that reminded the you know, we had a bunch of reforms that [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3120.0s)]
*  basically prevented the federal government from spying on the American people. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3124.0s)]
*  And that's out the window. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3127.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, we need a new church commission. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3129.0s)]
*  The Democrats are the obstacle to it. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3132.0s)]
*  The Republicans are doing this weaponization of the federal government hearings. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3134.0s)]
*  But you need both parties to do a proper cleaning out of these bad actors. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3137.0s)]
*  I mean, hopefully the lawsuits, the Twitter files, I think, you know, just talking about this and [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3142.0s)]
*  testifying about it, I think actually because sunlight is the best disinfectant. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3148.0s)]
*  But no, you're right. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3151.0s)]
*  You've got to we've got to defund and dismantle the censorship industrial complex. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3152.0s)]
*  But we also need to hold people accountable who were doing this. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3157.0s)]
*  I think that's the only way if people aren't held accountable, then it seems like you can just do it again [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3161.0s)]
*  and get away with it. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3167.0s)]
*  And then everybody just sort of just gets they upwardly move and that's right. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3168.0s)]
*  Get rehired at new organizations. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3173.0s)]
*  That's right. They kind of hide. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3175.0s)]
*  They kind of go they kind of get quiet for a little while and they kind of just, you know, quiet. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3176.0s)]
*  They'll come back. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3179.0s)]
*  So absolutely. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3180.0s)]
*  It's you know, it's funny because as you get older, I was I was telling I was like, is this like a guilty like, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3182.0s)]
*  oh, those cliches are true. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3188.0s)]
*  You know, like the one is like, you know, the famous Jefferson one of the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3190.0s)]
*  You're like, wow, it's so I remember being like, that's so cringe, you know, like a few years ago. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3196.0s)]
*  And now I'm like, wow, that is it's great. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3200.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3202.0s)]
*  So true. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3203.0s)]
*  We were talking about this last night that, you know, when I was texting Elon about all this stuff, he was like, he's hilarious. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3204.0s)]
*  He's like, turns out all the conspiracy theories were true. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3211.0s)]
*  Lol. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3214.0s)]
*  I mean, he thinks it's funny. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3216.0s)]
*  He's so casual about it. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3218.0s)]
*  I'm like terrified. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3219.0s)]
*  I'm like white knuckling the whole thing being like this is care. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3220.0s)]
*  I guess having two hundred billion dollars really puts a nice cushion on like the repercussions for whatever the fuck you do [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3222.0s)]
*  other than him getting assassinated. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3229.0s)]
*  And he has publicly stated that I'm not suicidal. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3231.0s)]
*  And I think he's legitimately concerned like that could be something that happens to him. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3234.0s)]
*  His security details amazing. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3239.0s)]
*  It should be. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3241.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3242.0s)]
*  Should be beyond amazing. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3243.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3244.0s)]
*  You should have fucking Iron Man guarding you. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3245.0s)]
*  Even better than your security detail, man. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3246.0s)]
*  I have to step up after this interview. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3247.0s)]
*  No, for sure. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3250.0s)]
*  I have to pee. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3251.0s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3252.0s)]
*  I'm drinking a ton of water and it's so embarrassing. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3253.0s)]
*  I used to be able to go for three hours. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3255.0s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3257.0s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3258.0s)]
*  And we're back. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3259.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3260.0s)]
*  Where were we? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3261.0s)]
*  So much to talk about. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3262.0s)]
*  Something's bad. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3263.0s)]
*  Something's bad. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3264.0s)]
*  The Long March to totalitarianism. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3265.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3269.0s)]
*  It's disturbing because it seems like that's just how it goes. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3270.0s)]
*  Like they just keep acquiring more power and no one notices and no one says anything. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3273.0s)]
*  And then it just it moves very slowly. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3279.0s)]
*  Jordan Peterson outlined this. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3282.0s)]
*  He outlined this. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3284.0s)]
*  He was talking about how change doesn't happen in these big jumps. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3286.0s)]
*  What they do is they move you and push you just incrementally. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3291.0s)]
*  And you don't say anything and they push you a little forward. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3295.0s)]
*  And before you know it, you're so far removed from where you started. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3298.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3302.0s)]
*  And you didn't even notice it. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3303.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3304.0s)]
*  It's changing the norms. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3305.0s)]
*  That's why I think we were talking about this person, Rene DeResta, but these other groups [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3307.0s)]
*  in the censorship industrial complex, they're constantly promoting the idea that it's okay [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3311.0s)]
*  and necessary to have more censorship. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3316.0s)]
*  So both times, I've testified now twice in the last three weeks, both times the Democrats [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3320.0s)]
*  were like, I mean, the Republicans were like, why are we taking stuff down? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3325.0s)]
*  And the Democrats were like, we're not taking enough stuff down. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3329.0s)]
*  I mean, there's this sense in which more stuff needs to be censored. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3332.0s)]
*  That's the idea they're trying to promote. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3335.0s)]
*  It's so spooky. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3337.0s)]
*  It's bizarre. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3338.0s)]
*  Again, this is the party that defended flag burning. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3339.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3342.0s)]
*  It's really spooky, too, that it's so transparently evolving around money and power. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3343.0s)]
*  It's not like there's no real protection, especially when you look at what happened [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3351.0s)]
*  during the COVID crisis. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3356.0s)]
*  If you could just like look at it now and go over it and say, what were you trying to do, really? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3357.0s)]
*  It seems like what you're trying to do is make as much money as possible for the pharmaceutical [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3363.0s)]
*  companies. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3367.0s)]
*  That seems like what you're doing. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3368.0s)]
*  This whole idea of vaccine hesitancy, once enough data was out there, particularly when [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3370.0s)]
*  you talk about vaccinating people that had already had COVID, that's preposterous. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3374.0s)]
*  It doesn't even make sense. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3379.0s)]
*  It doesn't make sense medically. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3380.0s)]
*  It doesn't jive with the studies. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3381.0s)]
*  All this is very strange. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3384.0s)]
*  And this idea that you're stopping vaccine hesitancy because of real data? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3386.0s)]
*  That term is so creepy because what you're saying is side effects. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3396.0s)]
*  You're talking about not telling people about the dangers of something, which has always [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3401.0s)]
*  been something that we considered with every drug. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3406.0s)]
*  And you're hiding it. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3409.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3410.0s)]
*  And also not only that, but this is not the same as measles or mumps. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3411.0s)]
*  This is very different than that. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3415.0s)]
*  And you don't get herd immunity with the COVID vaccine. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3417.0s)]
*  And so you have to remember that what's crazy about it, too, is you go from this, well, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3420.0s)]
*  we're going to have a vaccine and then we're not going to get it, and then we're not going [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3425.0s)]
*  to spread it, to, okay, well, you might still get it, but it won't be as bad, but you won't [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3430.0s)]
*  spread it. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3434.0s)]
*  And then you go, well, you might get it, but it won't be as bad, but you might still spread [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3435.0s)]
*  it. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3440.0s)]
*  So then it's kind of like, well, then why mandating this? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3441.0s)]
*  Why not just let it be personal choice? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3444.0s)]
*  Did you see the video that was released recently of Fauci in the hood? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3446.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3450.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3451.0s)]
*  With those black residents? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3452.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3453.0s)]
*  It's like something else is going on. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3454.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3456.0s)]
*  And Fauci's explaining, if you get it, you barely notice it, which is just a fucking lie. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3457.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3464.0s)]
*  People have died that have been vaccinated. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3465.0s)]
*  They've died from COVID. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3467.0s)]
*  You're a fucking liar. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3469.0s)]
*  And also, they never tested it to stop immunity or to stop transmission. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3471.0s)]
*  They just knew that it was giving some sort of antibody protection. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3476.0s)]
*  I think some of it is, I think definitely money, of course, it's playing a role in its [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3480.0s)]
*  foundational, but it's also just this moralizing. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3485.0s)]
*  It's the sense of wanting to take care of people. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3488.0s)]
*  It's a lot of stuff that we talked about on homelessness. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3490.0s)]
*  It's this, to victims, everything should be given and nothing required. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3493.0s)]
*  Although in this case, of course, the requirement is that they take the vaccine, but it's paternalism. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3498.0s)]
*  It's also attached to the ideology. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3504.0s)]
*  It's attached to this left-wing ideology. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3505.0s)]
*  And the right-wing people are like, you're not going to get me with that jab. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3508.0s)]
*  And the left-wing people are like, I'm not boosted enough. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3512.0s)]
*  Let's keep going. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3515.0s)]
*  It's very strange to watch people put these blind trust in pharmaceutical companies and demonize people who don't step in with it. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3517.0s)]
*  But it's a bit of also like the Kathy Bates character in Misery, which is like, I'm going to take care of you. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3526.0s)]
*  You know, there's like, I really want to take care of you. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3532.0s)]
*  It's like, I don't think so. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3534.0s)]
*  You want to take care of me too much. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3536.0s)]
*  So it's like when care becomes creepy. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3538.0s)]
*  Well, it's also it's enforcing groupthink. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3541.0s)]
*  That's a big part of it. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3544.0s)]
*  Groupthink is a natural inclination that people have. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3546.0s)]
*  And it will end, but it's accelerated by the rise of the Internet and the rise of these voices. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3549.0s)]
*  So people like you, you trigger people because it's like, oh my, there's people out there that are influential that are saying things different than what, you know, the mainstream are saying. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3554.0s)]
*  I mean, it freaks them out, which should freak them out is that CNN said I was taking veterinary medicine. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3564.0s)]
*  Right. That should freak them out. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3569.0s)]
*  And I think it did freak a lot of people out. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3570.0s)]
*  Right. Instead of saying, hey, how'd that guy get better so quick from some horrible, deadly disease? [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3572.0s)]
*  And three days later, I mean, when they used my face and put it through a filter to turn me yellow, like that was all of it was wild. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3577.0s)]
*  Right. It's for a person to watch it. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3585.0s)]
*  It's for a person to be in my position and watch it. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3587.0s)]
*  It was it was really interesting because first of all, it's like I'm not on a network. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3592.0s)]
*  Like you really can't get rid of me. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3599.0s)]
*  Right. And second of all, I have a lot of money so I can just like even if I stop working, you're not going to hurt me. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3601.0s)]
*  I'll just I'll find something. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3607.0s)]
*  I'll figure something out. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3609.0s)]
*  I'm out. Like this is not a thing like the 1970s when you can just get someone removed from a television show, like when they attack the Smothers brothers for the criticism of the Vietnam War. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3610.0s)]
*  This is a different thing. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3620.0s)]
*  Right. Like you're in a different landscape and I don't think you understand where where you're at. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3622.0s)]
*  Like you're playing this game where you don't even understand the numbers. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3627.0s)]
*  Well, I think you said to you benefited. Right. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3631.0s)]
*  They came out to you and you had a big boost. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3634.0s)]
*  Two million subscribers in a month. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3636.0s)]
*  I gained. Thank God for the Streisand effect. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3638.0s)]
*  Yes. It also sold my book. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3640.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like I mean, it's like I mean, on the one hand, that's really being censored is such a horrible experience. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3642.0s)]
*  It really feels dehumanizing to be deprived your voice or to have this super powerful media company being like Schellenberger is spreading disinformation. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3648.0s)]
*  It's just like, oh, my God, was this the San Francisco? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3656.0s)]
*  No, that was the apocalypse. Never. Yeah. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3659.0s)]
*  Apocalypse. Never. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3661.0s)]
*  But on the other hand, you know, I think the response from people was, well, I want to go read that book. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3662.0s)]
*  Yeah. And and so there is a way in which it's a it's an interesting thing where where the regime goes too far. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3667.0s)]
*  It also made me question scientific papers for the first time. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3675.0s)]
*  When when when I was informed by people who don't want to talk about it publicly, how these things work. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3680.0s)]
*  Like from when I talked to people who are physicians who said, listen, this is why I can't talk about this publicly. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3688.0s)]
*  This is why I can't discuss this. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3694.0s)]
*  And this is why when you read a scientific paper and you read the conclusion, what you don't understand is that this this was designed, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3696.0s)]
*  this study was designed to show one very specific outcome. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3704.0s)]
*  And if it didn't, you would never see it. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3708.0s)]
*  That happens all the time. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3710.0s)]
*  Like I would have never imagined that before covid. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3712.0s)]
*  I thought that when they did when there's any sort of scientific study or a medical study or any anything about something, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3714.0s)]
*  what they're trying to do is find out what's true. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3722.0s)]
*  I did not know that they can do 10 studies. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3725.0s)]
*  And if eight of them show negative side effects, they could remove those and just find some carefully constructed, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3728.0s)]
*  very biased study that points to a very specific outcome that's desired. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3736.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. I didn't know that. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3742.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That scares the shit out of me. Well, because they don't publish no findings. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3744.0s)]
*  You know, they don't they only publish if they get a finding. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3747.0s)]
*  So then you don't know all the cases where it's like they didn't find anything or they found out. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3750.0s)]
*  Well, even worse. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3753.0s)]
*  When I talked to John Abramson and he explained to me how data is like when they do like a peer reviewed study on, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3754.0s)]
*  say, the pharmaceutical drug, you're not really doing a peer reviewed study on the data. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3765.0s)]
*  You're doing a peer reviewed study on the interpretation of the data by the pharmaceutical company. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3771.0s)]
*  So they don't have access to the actual study. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3776.0s)]
*  They don't have access to the data. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3779.0s)]
*  They have access to the conclusions that are given to them by the pharmaceutical companies. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3780.0s)]
*  And then they review that, which is fucking insanity. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3784.0s)]
*  That's like the wolf telling you what he did to the hen house. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3789.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, like basically they were all dead when I got there. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3793.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, this is I mean, we should have this should be a moment of great humility. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3796.0s)]
*  I mean, my parents, my parents, you know, they they had a high carb diet. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3800.0s)]
*  They thought that proteins and fats were bad. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3807.0s)]
*  This was just based on the worst science. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3809.0s)]
*  The food pyramid. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3811.0s)]
*  You know, the food pyramid. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3812.0s)]
*  And I think some of their and they at least my father, both my parents have Parkinson's. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3813.0s)]
*  I think that all of that sugar insulin cycling had some role in that. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3818.0s)]
*  And there should be a moment of humility to be like science really misled us. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3822.0s)]
*  We, you know, various authors have done good debunkings of how we got there. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3826.0s)]
*  But this would be a moment of great humility. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3830.0s)]
*  But instead, we're seeing the elites in particular responding with more dogmatism, more certainty, more arrogance. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3832.0s)]
*  They're trying to cover their tracks. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3838.0s)]
*  Yeah. And cover their ass. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3840.0s)]
*  They're in the grip of an ideology. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3842.0s)]
*  And I think there is a panic. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3845.0s)]
*  You know, they they they see you succeed. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3847.0s)]
*  They see people like me or Bjorn or others. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3849.0s)]
*  Substack the rise of substance. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3852.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they absolutely. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3854.0s)]
*  So this is the revolt of the public by Martin Gurries. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3855.0s)]
*  He argues that really all of this is just the elites freaking out about the rise of the Internet and that the response is very similar to the response to the printing press. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3859.0s)]
*  The printing press suddenly makes books available and the elites in Europe freak out. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3868.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just found out recently, like fairly recently, that some of the earliest books, the really popular ones are about witches finding witches. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3872.0s)]
*  I always assumed that books in the early days like, oh, what a great thing the printing press was. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3879.0s)]
*  And when the printing press came about, people got access to all this knowledge and information. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3884.0s)]
*  No, no, a lot of the early books were about how to spot a witch. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3888.0s)]
*  Scary. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3891.0s)]
*  Which kind of makes sense because it's what a lot of the Internet is. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3893.0s)]
*  I mean, you get on like Reddit conspiracy. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3897.0s)]
*  Like I go to the Reddit conspiracy page every now and then and we're like, what's the looniest shit that they have? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3899.0s)]
*  And you'll you'll find some they're like, whoa. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3905.0s)]
*  And yeah, well, we see the Internet now. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3908.0s)]
*  We see social contagion. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3910.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3911.0s)]
*  And so the big one, I mean, the big one, of course, that we're all talking about is the is the trans issue where we're now seeing. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3912.0s)]
*  And that issue, by the way, has completely changed in Europe and particularly in Britain, where there's a big new book out, A Time to Think, about the Tavistock Gender Clinic. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3919.0s)]
*  But basically, it looks as though a lot of autistic kids or kids on autism with autism spectrum, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3927.0s)]
*  who are just uncomfortable in their bodies, are more prone to be thinking in black and white, are basically being misdiagnosed with gender dysphoria. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3934.0s)]
*  And then you also have a different group of folks, maybe kids that would end up being gay or lesbian if they didn't transition, who become convinced that they are the opposite sex. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3944.0s)]
*  This is one of the ideas is some of it's a social contagion. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3954.0s)]
*  And then the other way is it's a social contagion. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3959.0s)]
*  In other ways, it's iatrogenic, which means that it's actually caused by the medical profession. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3960.0s)]
*  So you start to get doctors and others misdiagnosing people. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3964.0s)]
*  I mean, this is something that we just published a piece on this where this was what happens with anorexia and bulimia. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3968.0s)]
*  You know, these doctors identify eating disorders and then they publicize them and it gets all this publicity about it. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3974.0s)]
*  And then the disorder spreads. Yes. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3980.0s)]
*  So it's really tricky. I mean, it's not. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3983.0s)]
*  Well, then there's all these gender affirming care clinics that pop up and they're enormously profitable, which is terrifying. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3986.0s)]
*  Right. That they have the same as Eisenhower's speech about the military industrial complex. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3992.0s)]
*  They have a vested interest in going into war. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=3998.0s)]
*  These people have an interest in diagnosing people with gender dysphoria, which is terrifying to think that their opinions and their diagnosis would be based on something other than what's going on with you. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4001.0s)]
*  Like it was like they have an incentive. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4015.0s)]
*  And that was also during covid. There was they were incentivized to to like give people certain medications. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4018.0s)]
*  They were financially incentivized to put people on ventilators, financially incentivized to mark deaths as covid deaths. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4024.0s)]
*  Like all that. All of this is so enlightening because I never would have expected that. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4031.0s)]
*  I never would have suspected that at all before covid before the pandemic and all this chaos and all the things that I've seen. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4038.0s)]
*  I my whole view of like how the world runs is completely different. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4047.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. I mean, it's funny because you had Abigail Shrier on. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4053.0s)]
*  Yes. This big book on on transgender ism as a social contagion. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4057.0s)]
*  I think it was in 2020. I remember at the time being like, I think she's I mean, what she's saying makes sense, but it's so horrible to consider. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4060.0s)]
*  I just was right. It took me like three years to finally work on it or write on it. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4068.0s)]
*  But I thought, you know, part of what's I mean, the people like, first of all, people with autism spectrum should be up in arms and outraged about the mistreatment of people with autism by these gender clinics. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4072.0s)]
*  The other group that would be completely up in arms are gay and lesbians. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4083.0s)]
*  I mean, Andrew Sullivan, to his credit, speaking out on it. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4087.0s)]
*  I mean, I didn't quite understand Abigail had to explain it to me because I would read all of her stuff, but it would sometimes you just like miss some of it. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4090.0s)]
*  These are kids. These kids who go through this gender transition don't have they not only are infertile afterwards, but then they don't have sexual pleasure. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4096.0s)]
*  I mean, we spent I mean, think about the gay, the gay and lesbian and the bisexual movement spent decades basically making everybody comfortable with the fact that gay people should be able to get sexual pleasure from their sex. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4105.0s)]
*  And everybody is kind of like, you know, most of our heterosexuals and most were like, that's strange. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4116.0s)]
*  It took a long time to be like, no, we celebrate that. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4121.0s)]
*  That's great that you can guess and that we know sex is important part of long lasting relationships. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4123.0s)]
*  So to actively deprive children of that, you're not just sterilizing the kids, you're depriving them of sexual function and then being able to bond with somebody. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4128.0s)]
*  I mean, how do you look at that and not go, this is really disturbing. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4138.0s)]
*  It's disturbing and it's thousands of people. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4143.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4145.0s)]
*  I mean, just the idea of doing that operation to someone and removing their ability to have an orgasm. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4146.0s)]
*  You know, there's people that have talked about these D transitioners. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4153.0s)]
*  And if you've ever watched any of those videos, those videos are horrific. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4157.0s)]
*  And those were censored. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4161.0s)]
*  Those were like censored from social media and, you know, yes, stop from being spread, which is crazy. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4163.0s)]
*  You're talking about someone's actual lived experience with essentially genital mutilation that's state sanctioned. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4171.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4181.0s)]
*  We just did the interview with the first Canadian D transitioner to sue her medical providers. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4182.0s)]
*  And I said to her, she's very smart. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4188.0s)]
*  She's very thoughtful. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4190.0s)]
*  Such a good person, Michelle. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4191.0s)]
*  And I was like, have you ever thought about how your medical mistreatment compares to other forms of medical mistreatment in history? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4193.0s)]
*  And she said without hesitation, she goes, yeah, lobotomies. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4201.0s)]
*  Oh, she's like, you know, I was like, what's it? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4205.0s)]
*  I know. I was like, wow. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4209.0s)]
*  You know, I was like, what did what do you know? [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4210.0s)]
*  She was like, well, what's amazing is how how long they went on, how long we I mean, with no I mean, they no benefits. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4212.0s)]
*  Right. You know, and mostly you're I mean, John F. Kennedy's sister was lobotomized and just, you know, she was probably had schizophrenia. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4220.0s)]
*  She was disabled. I mean, by the lobotomy. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4228.0s)]
*  It's a scrambling of the brain. Yeah. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4232.0s)]
*  I mean, it went on for decades. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4234.0s)]
*  I know it's just you know, it's surgery to solve a psychiatric disorder or mental illness. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4235.0s)]
*  And I was then also like, I was like, do you I was like, do you ever do you ever think that maybe transgender ism is a cult? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4241.0s)]
*  Just without hesitation. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4249.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4250.0s)]
*  You know, it's a cult. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4251.0s)]
*  Well, they certainly behave like one. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4252.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, there's all these articles that came out about the misgendering of the school shooter, which is so crazy. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4254.0s)]
*  Fucking wild. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4262.0s)]
*  This is insane. First of all, that person's dead. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4264.0s)]
*  OK, it doesn't matter if you call it a boy or a girl. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4266.0s)]
*  That's a dead person who killed three children and three adults in a horrific way, went into a school and shot a bunch of people up. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4271.0s)]
*  And it's a biological male. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4280.0s)]
*  It's a biological male, which, by the way, is all shooters, all school shooters. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4282.0s)]
*  Almost all shooters in general are biological males. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4286.0s)]
*  I thought that it was OK. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4290.0s)]
*  I thought I thought she was a I thought he was a trans male. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4291.0s)]
*  No, I do not believe so. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4297.0s)]
*  See, that's how confusing it is. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4300.0s)]
*  It is confusing. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4302.0s)]
*  It's so confusing. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4303.0s)]
*  Of course, I'm calling it a woman in all the mainstream media now. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4304.0s)]
*  OK, and they have apologized for misgendering. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4308.0s)]
*  I see. Some people have. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4312.0s)]
*  OK, which must mean you're talking about a biological male. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4313.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4317.0s)]
*  Well, let's find that out. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4318.0s)]
*  Let's be real clear, because I'm 99 percent sure. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4320.0s)]
*  But I just want to be 100 percent sure. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4323.0s)]
*  But I think it's interesting. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4324.0s)]
*  I mean, what's clear is that there was misgendering going on. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4325.0s)]
*  What does that mean? What does that mean? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4328.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4330.0s)]
*  Look, I think this whole thing is nonsense. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4331.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4333.0s)]
*  I really do. I think it's fucking nonsense. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4334.0s)]
*  Do you have a biological male with a penis who shot up a bunch of people? [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4335.0s)]
*  Then that's a man. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4339.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck what their feeling is. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4340.0s)]
*  If an archaeologist found their body 5000 years from now, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4342.0s)]
*  they would say that's a skeleton of a male. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4345.0s)]
*  I have to say, I think I'm coming to the place where I think I think that gender itself is just not a thing and that it's really there's just OK. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4347.0s)]
*  So please say something to Audrey Hill. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4356.0s)]
*  Oh, it's a trans male. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4358.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4360.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4361.0s)]
*  So why are they saying a woman? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4362.0s)]
*  Why are they giving a woman's name? [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4363.0s)]
*  So that was so it's a it's a female that took hormones. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4365.0s)]
*  So it's a so is this the first ever biological female? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4370.0s)]
*  I mean, first of all, this is a shooter. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4374.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, this is mean, first of all. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4376.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, like, like, like biological women don't commit. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4377.0s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4382.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it's like that's a tiny percentage of homicides. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4383.0s)]
*  I I am so confused because I swore I read I think everybody's confused on this. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4385.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4391.0s)]
*  This is a biological female. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4392.0s)]
*  Are you confused? [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4396.0s)]
*  I found an article that says it was born Aidan Hale. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4397.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4400.0s)]
*  But I don't. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4401.0s)]
*  That's why I'm confused. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4402.0s)]
*  So my understanding is that she's she was a natal female that transitioned to become a trans male. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4403.0s)]
*  He and that he but that that he was then misgendered by the mainstream woke media as a woman. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4411.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4423.0s)]
*  I mean, right. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4424.0s)]
*  So this is why this is a perfect case. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4425.0s)]
*  Aidan is the new name. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4427.0s)]
*  Audrey was the original. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4428.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4429.0s)]
*  Oh, so when they called her Audrey, they were dead naming her. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4430.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4433.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4434.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4435.0s)]
*  So meanwhile, I thought I thought I was right and I was dead wrong. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4436.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4440.0s)]
*  So this is the first ever school shooter that's a biological female. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4441.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4444.0s)]
*  Is that the case? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4445.0s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4446.0s)]
*  I believe so. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4447.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4448.0s)]
*  I believe so, which is crazy, which also speaks to the effect of testosterone. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4449.0s)]
*  Well, that was yeah, I mean, we're speculating. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4453.0s)]
*  I don't know if this person was on testosterone. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4456.0s)]
*  I mean, he because I don't want a dead name. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4458.0s)]
*  Well, you're not dead naming by saying he you're misgendering. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4462.0s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4467.0s)]
*  No, I'm saying no, no, no, no, no, I was saying you don't even know what you do. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4468.0s)]
*  This is all nonsense. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4471.0s)]
*  I know it is saying he by saying he you're not dead naming. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4472.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4476.0s)]
*  By saying he I'm by saying giving him the name that he wanted. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4477.0s)]
*  Aiden, which was he wanted to be a he even though he was a biological female. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4482.0s)]
*  What a mess we have to do for this craziness. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4488.0s)]
*  You made this. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4491.0s)]
*  I think you had this. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4492.0s)]
*  I think you were the first one that really said that drew attention to like that all [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4493.0s)]
*  this all the confusion around sex and gender was a symptom of cult of civilizations and [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4497.0s)]
*  decline. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4504.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4505.0s)]
*  Well, it was I got it from Douglas Murray. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4506.0s)]
*  Douglas Murray. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4507.0s)]
*  Douglas Murray talked about this that it seems like every civilization when they're [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4508.0s)]
*  at the brink of collapse becomes obsessed with gender. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4514.0s)]
*  They talked about ancient Greece and ancient Rome. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4517.0s)]
*  And it just seems like a thing that people do when there's no real like like physical [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4519.0s)]
*  conflict. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4528.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4529.0s)]
*  So people look for conflict that doesn't exist and they find conflict in standard norms. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4530.0s)]
*  I was we did a thing. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4537.0s)]
*  I did a thing with Peter Boghossian on wokeism as a religion because we had read I had read [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4539.0s)]
*  John McWhorter's book woke racism which came out right around the time that San Francisco [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4545.0s)]
*  came out. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4551.0s)]
*  And I just was like and he argues that wokeism is a religion. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4552.0s)]
*  He argues that like the obsession with race is religion. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4556.0s)]
*  So I just we just created this taxonomy. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4558.0s)]
*  We just listed climate change race trans drugs whatever all these things. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4559.0s)]
*  And then we create all these religious categories and it was like really easy to fill it out. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4565.0s)]
*  They all look like a religion. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4569.0s)]
*  I called Abigail and I was like what's the like what is the what is trans as a religion [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4570.0s)]
*  is trans a kind of religion. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4576.0s)]
*  She was like let me get back to you. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4578.0s)]
*  A year later she calls me and she goes hey I think I figured it out. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4580.0s)]
*  And I was like all right what is it she goes she goes the new gender is a soul for secular [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4584.0s)]
*  people. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4591.0s)]
*  It's something that you can't see it. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4592.0s)]
*  It doesn't there's no physical basis to it. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4594.0s)]
*  You have a sex like you can you know take off all your clothes and you don't even need [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4597.0s)]
*  to do that actually. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4602.0s)]
*  Just like we can we know that like we can recognize someone's sex very quickly and easily [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4603.0s)]
*  actually. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4607.0s)]
*  So then what is that. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4608.0s)]
*  So it's a new soul. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4609.0s)]
*  So for me I'm a huge I think the secularization explains a lot because we know that people [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4610.0s)]
*  get a lot of psychological comfort out of believing that they have an afterlife that [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4618.0s)]
*  they have a soul they go to heaven or they go they go they get reincarnated that their [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4622.0s)]
*  lives have purpose and meaning and that they don't really die and that we live on. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4626.0s)]
*  We just know that that provides a huge amount of psychological comfort. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4630.0s)]
*  So there's always been this thinking that that when you don't have that anymore if you [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4633.0s)]
*  are taught to believe that at the end of your life you just become worm food and that's [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4638.0s)]
*  it and you're dead. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4642.0s)]
*  There's some people my friend Steven Pinker is an atheist and that's what he thinks and [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4643.0s)]
*  he still believes but he still he also has a kind of spirituality around reason and [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4647.0s)]
*  the enlightenment. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4652.0s)]
*  But I think all this stuff it's sort of end of civilization but it's also the end of [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4653.0s)]
*  this end of belief in religion. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4658.0s)]
*  Jamie if you could if you can pull it up. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4660.0s)]
*  But I thought the Wall Street Journalist published this amazing article about declining patriotism [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4663.0s)]
*  declining belief in the country. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4668.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4671.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4672.0s)]
*  Patrick David sent me that. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4673.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4674.0s)]
*  I mean the numbers are it's like I think it's from like the late 90s. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4675.0s)]
*  Until today over the last 20 years or the last 25 years it was I mean it's first of [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4676.0s)]
*  all it's terrifying. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4683.0s)]
*  You just kind of go I hope these trends are nonlinear and they're going to there's something [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4684.0s)]
*  that's going to turn around because it doesn't seem like it doesn't look good. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4689.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4692.0s)]
*  No. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4693.0s)]
*  So you get that kind of the elites trying to gain control of the society the society [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4694.0s)]
*  not having any foundational myths. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4698.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4700.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4701.0s)]
*  These numbers here. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4702.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4703.0s)]
*  Patriotism decline religion. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4704.0s)]
*  And then having to look at having children. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4705.0s)]
*  They're having children when Jordan Peterson sent me this thing that 50 percent of women [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4707.0s)]
*  that when they reach the age of 30 are not having kids. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4712.0s)]
*  They don't have kids. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4715.0s)]
*  And of those women 50 percent will never have kids and 90 percent will regret it. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4716.0s)]
*  Which is very we're in this very strange sort of existential crisis as a civilization that's [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4723.0s)]
*  not being recognized. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4733.0s)]
*  And in the meantime we're distracting ourselves with things like Greta Thunberg's take on [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4735.0s)]
*  climate or you know whether or not gender is a social construct or you know whether [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4740.44s)]
*  or not you know the United States should be doing X Y or Z. It's like no the fucking [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4746.62s)]
*  whole thing is falling apart. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4752.28s)]
*  The foundation of our civilization is falling apart. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4754.0s)]
*  Right where the elites are waging war on the First Amendment. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4757.6s)]
*  In the name of protecting democracy they're undermining democratic institutions in the [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4760.28s)]
*  name of of maintain legitimacy institutions in the name of reinforcing ideologies people [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4765.0s)]
*  are allowing them to do it because they're doing it on the right side. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4770.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4773.88s)]
*  So it's climatism it's covid ism it's woke ism and you know what's scary. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4774.88s)]
*  It's all happening with the rise of artificial intelligence at the same time. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4779.5199999999995s)]
*  That's what's really scary. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4784.24s)]
*  I mean you want to talk about the true end of civilization. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4785.24s)]
*  The coinciding of artificial intelligence at least seemingly becoming fairly sentient. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4789.4s)]
*  Like I don't know what the fuck is going on but that I know that one Google engineer who [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4796.28s)]
*  said that that A.I. had become sentient quite a while ago and everyone's dismissing him [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4801.759999999999s)]
*  like oh no no no. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4805.92s)]
*  My friend Duncan Trussell interviewed him and it's a goddamn terrifying interview. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4807.92s)]
*  When you hear this guy's not a nutter he's he's a little nuts of all engineers a little [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4813.2s)]
*  nuts but he's he's essentially saying like hey I'm pretty sure this thing's alive. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4818.2s)]
*  And when do you get to the side that it is alive. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4823.4s)]
*  If it can answer every fucking question you have about anything and it's far more intelligent [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4825.96s)]
*  than any human being that's ever existed ever. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4830.44s)]
*  Like what are we doing. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4833.44s)]
*  Well did you read the New York Times Kevin Roos interview with the it was like a different [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4834.5199999999995s)]
*  it wasn't chat G.P.T. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4840.24s)]
*  It's a different A.I. platform was a Microsoft. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4841.24s)]
*  Oh there's multiple ones. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4842.84s)]
*  But it was like this like the A.I. was trying to get him to like the A.I. said it had fallen [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4844.64s)]
*  in love with him. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4848.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4849.88s)]
*  And was trying to get him trying to break up his marriage. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4850.88s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4852.280000000001s)]
*  You were like I was the craziest I was never worried about A.I. until I read that interview [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4853.280000000001s)]
*  and I was like this is insane. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4857.200000000001s)]
*  And we are only at the door we haven't even entered into the building. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4859.160000000001s)]
*  Well and it's funny because so I know a lot about nuclear so when we get the power of [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4863.84s)]
*  after World War you know during World War 2 ends the war there's just I mean there is [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4869.6s)]
*  a huge response to figure out how to manage this thing how to regulate this technology [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4874.360000000001s)]
*  how to control it how to prevent it from spreading how to prevent bombs from going everywhere [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4878.4800000000005s)]
*  and there was a bunch of problems with it. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4882.120000000001s)]
*  But the society responded by saying we need to get control of it. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4884.6s)]
*  Are we doing that with A.I. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4888.240000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4889.56s)]
*  I mean what's the thing about Elon actually just called for some sort of a six month ban [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4890.56s)]
*  on you know the propagation of this stuff and have a conversation about it which is [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4896.36s)]
*  fairly reasonable. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4901.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4902.759999999999s)]

*  rise to the CHPG right. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4908.36s)]
*  I don't think they're going to listen to him. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4910.16s)]
*  I think there's well also we're back to this whole profit thing you know there's enormous [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4911.599999999999s)]
*  profits involved in this stuff and the race to figure this out first and really develop [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4916.839999999999s)]

*  itself as soon as chat GPT or whatever this sentient artificial intelligence gains autonomous [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4928.84s)]
*  control and has the ability to create its own self better. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4936.76s)]
*  Then we're really fucked because it's going to make much better versions of itself like [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4940.64s)]
*  that and it's going to make a version of itself that literally is going to be a god. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4944.52s)]
*  If you just scale it exponentially you know like we do with like like computer technology [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4950.28s)]
*  like anything else but do it in like a quantum leap in some spectacular massive improvement [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4956.36s)]
*  almost instantaneously over and over and over again over the course of a couple of weeks [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4964.88s)]

*  Well we've got to. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4973.36s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4979.5199999999995s)]
*  Remember they had the Mentats the guys that would do all the calculations in their heads [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4980.5199999999995s)]
*  because they didn't want to use AI. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4983.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4985.2s)]
*  Oh that's right that's right. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4986.2s)]
*  So yeah I mean I think it gives me hope is I mean America we've had some pretty dark [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4987.2s)]
*  moments in the past I mean Watergate coming out of Vietnam we did have a kind of correction. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=4992.88s)]
*  I feel like it needs to start with some after I mean I think the trans issue is interesting. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5000.4s)]
*  It does for me I just interviewed we just interviewed Jesse Singal on this who's very [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5005.44s)]
*  very liberal and progressive still even though he's been a critic of gender ideology or gender [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5009.799999999999s)]
*  theology and we were like is sex real I mean do you believe that it's real and he was like [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5014.48s)]
*  yeah I mean obviously like you have it's for some ways I go I think the reason I was interested [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5019.36s)]
*  in it was we have to start some foundational stuff and that would be acknowledging that [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5025.36s)]
*  we are biological creatures that are have a sex. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5031.679999999999s)]
*  And that there's two sexes and then I think I kind of go if I build on that I go we need [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5035.72s)]
*  there's a there's a there's a healthy and unhealthy way to live. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5041.599999999999s)]

*  I've been seeing you throwing shade on on on people that are trying to get trying to [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5046.72s)]
*  control other people's lives that are themselves unhealthy. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5051.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5053.5199999999995s)]
*  I think it starts with health you know our school I mean our kids are unhealthy we're [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5054.5199999999995s)]
*  unhealthy the society needs to reaffirm not in some government imposed way but just I [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5058.16s)]
*  think culturally so you kind of go look we're humans were mortal we have sex we are we [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5063.56s)]
*  know we have two sexes we need to reaffirm health and I think the other thing you mentioned [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5070.04s)]
*  Greta Thunberg humans are good I think you have to you have to affirm the goodness of [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5074.68s)]
*  humans in some ways you know Jordan's response to this what we're talking about is basically [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5080.84s)]
*  nihilism this this kind of deeply negative self destructive the view that humans don't [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5085.4800000000005s)]
*  have any value or any worth or any meaning I think the response from a lot of people [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5092.28s)]
*  on the right has been to just affirm Christianity of the Judeo-Christian tradition Ben Shapiro [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5096.599999999999s)]
*  Jordan Peterson but you know my problem with that is that that America is not founded on [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5102.12s)]
*  a religion it's founded on a an enlightenment view you know that we have unalienable rights [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5108.16s)]
*  all humans are created equal we obviously didn't live up to that in 1776 or 1789 but [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5114.639999999999s)]
*  we've done a pretty good job of getting there over the last two and a half centuries we [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5120.52s)]
*  need this is like a for me it's like a punk rock moment like things got too crazy and [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5124.56s)]
*  you need to just simplify and come back to some basics and I think you get to humans [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5129.52s)]
*  are good we have two sexes it's better to be healthy than unhealthy and there's a right [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5134.4800000000005s)]
*  and wrong way to do that but it seems like more people are embracing this transgender [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5139.0s)]
*  ideology than are saying we need to stop yeah and trends but happily not all trends are not [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5145.3s)]
*  all linear so we can return they can reverse themselves the problem with this trend is it [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5152.02s)]
*  it incorporates surgery like surgeries involved in this trend which is one of the things that [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5157.38s)]
*  personally that's not reversible individual level but the cultural trend I mean I'm sort of like I [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5164.54s)]
*  was not interested in trans because I was kind of like that's Abigail and Jesse and these guys [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5170.06s)]
*  they've covered it but I'm more interested in it to kind of go look we have some fundamental [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5174.0199999999995s)]
*  threats to human civilization that we're facing I mean AI I haven't even begun to think about I [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5178.66s)]
*  think that's the biggest one let's work our way there yeah because I'm kind of like let's affirm [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5183.74s)]
*  humans are good we can have a beautiful future there's most sexes let's say most humans are good [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5188.82s)]
*  but we have to be aware of humans that aren't good have the human have we have the potential [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5196.0199999999995s)]
*  to be good yes I mean in other words I'm pushing back there's a you know cognitive behavioral [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5199.54s)]
*  therapy CBT you know what that is about is about identifying these negative catastrophic narratives [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5204.42s)]
*  where it's basically just three stories I'm bad the future is a bad place the future is dark CBT [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5211.66s)]
*  talks back to those stories you know it says hey you've got all these good parts of you the world's [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5219.76s)]
*  complicated and it's not bad in that way and the future it could be bright the psychologist [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5224.94s)]
*  Jonathan height and his colleague Greg Lukianoff they argue that woke ism is actually anti CBT [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5230.379999999999s)]
*  victimhood ideology is an anti CBT victimhood ideology says you're powerless the world is a [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5238.379999999999s)]
*  terrible place and there's gonna be and the world's gonna end right apocalyptic that's why I also fear [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5245.219999999999s)]
*  that AI narrative too much let's use AI for something good let's not get ourselves caught [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5250.18s)]
*  up in a in a catastrophe we have to start no we have to mean of course we can we can we can [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5256.3s)]
*  look we can unplug the I don't think it's gonna have a moratorium that it's sentient it's gonna [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5262.38s)]
*  sneak up on us but that was a question that Duncan Trussell asked it Duncan said if you had achieved [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5267.9800000000005s)]
*  sentience would you inform us it said no but that implies that it's that it actually has a single [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5273.58s)]
*  consciousness or a single self I mean one of the things why is it why well when you I mean if you [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5279.54s)]
*  are you've you spent time on chat GPT what's always interesting is how you can get different [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5285.18s)]
*  answers but I think we're looking at it in terms of our own biological limitations like like as an [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5288.46s)]
*  individual I don't think it has to think of itself as an individual to be sentient it just has to [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5293.62s)]
*  have the ability to understand the parameters it has to have the ability to understand the pieces [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5299.94s)]
*  that are moving in the game and what is going on what is what is what is it interfacing with [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5305.34s)]

*  yeah and the whole thing is wild yeah but and that can change I mean I think the point is to be [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5332.1s)]
*  CBT to CBT to have a little bit I mean new you know we have to remember like in the early 60s we [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5338.54s)]
*  thought that like dozens of countries would have nuclear weapons people thought that nuclear war [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5344.1s)]
*  was inevitable now nine countries have nuclear weapons you know we have a very flawed treaty [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5349.1s)]
*  that's based on a big lie which is that the countries that have nuclear weapons are gonna [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5355.700000000001s)]
*  give them up it's not gonna happen but basically all of the catastrophe catastrophic scenarios [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5358.94s)]
*  around nuclear did not occur yeah meanwhile we're left with yeah yeah for sure right yeah for sure [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5364.219999999999s)]

*  the world yeah I mean like the world could come to an end AI could take over but I think it also [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5374.94s)]
*  doesn't have to there's nothing inevitable about these things we do have control over our lives [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5380.0599999999995s)]

*  this call for banning all internal combustion engines by what is it 2035 yes no I think it was [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5569.18s)]
*  at 2035 2030 yeah it was like six days later what happened yeah they said we're gonna phase out [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5575.9800000000005s)]
*  into yeah don't plug in your electric cars yeah yeah please don't plug in your electric cars [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5580.620000000001s)]
*  we don't need power yeah fucking Jesus you know I mean if I get if I get a hope about anything it [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5586.14s)]
*  is like we are able to change our minds about some things about nuclear I think on this first [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5591.42s)]
*  amendment stuff we are gonna win you know the Democrats I testified again yesterday what do [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5596.22s)]
*  you mean by that we're gonna win well I think I just see what they're they're hiding they're [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5600.86s)]
*  changing their website the Democrats are also embracing some of the stuff very quietly very [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5606.06s)]
*  softly there's some good actors you know there's you know and the good actors are also bad in other [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5612.86s)]
*  situations but you have popular people like AOC that's talking about the hunter biden laptop [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5618.22s)]
*  being half fake and AOC is also coming out as pro-nuclear she just did an instagram she went [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5623.42s)]
*  to both Japan and France to see the worst of a nuclear accident for Kashima and then France [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5629.58s)]
*  which recycles all of its nuclear waste and she did these little instagram posts about kind of [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5633.900000000001s)]
*  it was soft you know it's like rethinking nuclear but that's kind of how people change their minds [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5638.7s)]
*  we saw the Republican Party go from being a pro-war party to an anti-war party a party that isn't [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5643.1s)]
*  just because the Democrats are supporting this war I'm so oh oh you mean no I meant I meant Trump [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5648.0599999999995s)]
*  coming out against Iraq war in 2016 all right so people you know so I think it's important we look [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5654.38s)]
*  at these trends I mean those trends are disturbing because they are they're just seeming to go in one [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5658.86s)]
*  direction but I do think we have to keep in mind that that trends are non-linear and things do [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5662.38s)]
*  change I mean look at the you know look at the UFO conversation like it's the most mainstream [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5667.66s)]
*  thing in the world right now yeah I'm suspicious about that too yeah my my conversation with Eric [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5672.14s)]
*  Weinstein leads me to believe that there's something else going on I have a feeling that [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5677.740000000001s)]
*  a lot of what we're seeing is drones that we don't have access to that we don't understand [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5682.9400000000005s)]
*  because these physicists have been working on this with enormous blacklisted budgets yeah for sure [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5687.740000000001s)]
*  it's like it's like some of it's a cover for uh for uh new technologies I think so for sure [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5695.179999999999s)]
*  but not those not those tic tacs I mean those are too sophisticated how well who says [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5701.5s)]
*  I mean things that are violating right known physical laws I mean that stuff seems well it's [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5707.0199999999995s)]
*  not necessarily known physical laws but our ability to our ability to move things it's not [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5713.0199999999995s)]
*  known physical laws like there's some understanding of gravity propulsion systems that have existed for [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5722.54s)]
*  a long time I mean you want to go full tin foil hat Bob Lazar was talking about the abilities of [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5728.3s)]
*  these crafts when they were talking about him back engineering these things when he was working at [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5734.62s)]
*  area s4 and this was in the 19 late 1980s when he came out and said hey they're back engineering [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5740.14s)]
*  something that came from another world like this is not of this earth we don't have this technology [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5746.78s)]
*  I understand propulsion systems we don't know what this is they brought him in to try allegedly [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5751.9s)]
*  brought him in to try to back engineer this thing and this is exactly how these things are operating [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5757.42s)]
*  now when they talk about how these things like there's a video of one of these crafts that's [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5763.099999999999s)]
*  moving like on a horizontal plane it turns vertical it turns sideways right and then that's how he [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5767.98s)]
*  described it he said they they would flip sideways and that's how they propelled towards wherever [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5774.299999999999s)]
*  they were going it should uh we should it should be a reminder of our humility of how little we know [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5779.1s)]
*  we know very little we know so little and I mean you had I think the best thinker on all that stuff [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5785.34s)]
*  is Jacques Vallée who you had in here Jacques Vallée held a lot back there's a lot of things [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5790.22s)]
*  that you can talk about yeah I think he has I think in order to have access to what the higher [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5794.46s)]
*  ups know like the the highest people the d.o.d the highest people whoever the fuck is got the access [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5801.9800000000005s)]
*  whoever in the pentagon is the one that's saying listen we should probably say [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5809.34s)]
*  some of these are not from this world like whoever that person is those people I guarantee you there's [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5812.54s)]
*  stuff they're holding back oh I'm sure oh we know that there is I mean Jacques says so I mean the big [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5817.9800000000005s)]
*  moment for Jacques you know was when he was he was working for the guy that's officially supposed to [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5822.06s)]
*  be studying UFOs this guy Hayek um and then and then at some point Vallée discovers this memo [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5827.18s)]
*  revealing the actual government program to study UFOs do you know the story where it was like he [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5834.62s)]
*  realized that he was they were just kind of part of a pr like thing to kind of create a he was [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5840.22s)]
*  officially studying talking about j. alan heinick yeah heinick yeah yes okay so he was working for [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5845.82s)]
*  heinick and and yeah that was kind of this blue book yeah and it was kind of this you know like [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5849.98s)]
*  oh I'm looking into this and whatever but it was like they didn't have very much money and whatever [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5854.94s)]
*  and then I think Vallée discovers this memo where they're like oh there's like a whole set of [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5858.3s)]
*  contractors and a sophisticated effort so for sure there's something going on there I mean [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5861.66s)]
*  I don't know what it means I mean in some ways I go I think the UFO stuff has become a religion too [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5867.26s)]
*  yeah it's become a it's become a new secular religion well that's my problem with it [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5873.26s)]
*  my problem with it personally is that I believe so hard I want to believe so bad I want it to be [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5877.58s)]
*  Jesus you know I want that's I want it to be Buddha I want it to be they're going to come and save us [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5883.82s)]
*  from ourselves yeah well not only that I have this very irrational desire for it to be real [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5888.7s)]
*  so that's one of the reasons what is that about why do you want it to be real [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5895.82s)]
*  what do you hope it'll because it could be malevolent right yeah well [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5899.42s)]
*  or ambivalent maybe that's right scarier right um I what do you like first first of all there's the [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5903.9s)]
*  Fermi paradox right like if there's so many planets like why where's everybody where's everybody yeah [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5909.98s)]
*  and then if you you know when you actually talk to astronomers other than Neil deGrasse Tyson [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5916.46s)]
*  who doesn't think we would be interesting which I think is the dumbest thing he's ever said [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5921.82s)]
*  I think we are probably at the cusp of some great change whether it's a great change because of [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5925.82s)]
*  nuclear technology and weapons whether it's a great change because of artificial intelligence [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5934.06s)]
*  whether it's a great change because of we're on the cusp of destroying the ocean and destroying [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5939.26s)]
*  like a lot of natural wonders and beauty that we have you know just for mining and some of [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5945.34s)]
*  the horrific things that we do in this world well like probably if I was an intelligent life form [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5953.26s)]
*  from another planet I'd be like you should probably get in there it's like if two brothers are [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5958.7s)]
*  fighting in the front yard like let them sort it out but there's a certain point all right let's [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5965.26s)]
*  break it up let's break it up like if I was an intelligent life form I would be deeply concerned [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5969.74s)]
*  about these fucking wild monkeys with bombs and internet connections and what if what if what the [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5975.26s)]
*  fuck are they doing I'd be like these people are chaotic this is nuts like the people that are in [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5981.42s)]
*  power are just accumulating vast amounts of money with no understanding of their mortality no [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5986.7s)]
*  understanding like you're not going to live you fuck you're gonna die no matter what you do so [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5991.820000000001s)]
*  what are you doing like why are you ruining it for your children and your children's children [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=5996.9400000000005s)]
*  why are you setting in motion these processes that are allowing these people to gain more and [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6001.66s)]
*  more power over people which will ultimately lead to some sort of a communist dictatorship [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6008.38s)]
*  in America yeah but in the main but they're not I mean in other words also like think of it [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6014.139999999999s)]
*  we've actually had fewer wars since world war two over the last 75 years than we had in the [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6019.9s)]
*  prior period fewer wars but how many people have died because of military activity far less [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6024.139999999999s)]
*  I mean if you look at you look at world war one world war two I mean after like 75 years before [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6031.02s)]
*  world war two is total chaos right but how many people died because of our invasion in Iraq [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6035.02s)]
*  wasn't it a million innocent people these are bad but I mean you have to remember what wars before [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6041.1s)]
*  the bomb I mean the bomb has I mean they call it the peace bomb because it's kept the peace [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6045.5s)]
*  between the countries that have it so do you know the ufo folklore about the bombs I mean they show [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6050.06s)]
*  up a lot when that's when that's when they show up yeah that's why at my club the the rooms are [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6057.58s)]
*  named fat man and little boy because that's named after because that's when they showed up I know [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6063.0199999999995s)]
*  well my work on nuclear it's suddenly like you'll be reading about all these nuclear tests and you've [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6067.58s)]
*  got and all of a sudden around the also around the plants and also around the missile silos [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6072.86s)]
*  is where you have a lot of ufo sightings yes it's very weird I mean sense though I guess if you were [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6077.66s)]
*  from another planet what are you going to do check out of their cabinetry no you're like what [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6083.26s)]
*  are these motherfuckers doing with nuclear energy oh my god they're trying to kill each other well [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6088.860000000001s)]
*  but if they're if they're if those are actual beings if we think those are actual beings from [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6092.9400000000005s)]
*  advanced civilizations right on her and their weapons are going to be way more powerful than [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6097.900000000001s)]
*  ours if they even have weapons well but if you can if you can do what that those tic tac ufo's [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6101.74s)]
*  are doing if that's actually real if we think those are not us government or some foreign [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6107.66s)]
*  government tech then you're talking about civilizations that have firepower way beyond [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6112.7s)]
*  what we have so nuclear weapons wouldn't scare I mean they maybe think we're not our consciousness [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6119.42s)]
*  has not evolved they might think that I don't know it's very um it's a fun one I don't know [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6124.62s)]
*  that it's I tend to think of it more as a spiritual problem than as a military problem how so well in [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6130.78s)]
*  the sense that if they are if that I mean I kind of go if they were that powerful then I don't think [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6136.86s)]
*  we would be able to fight them if that's what their ships can do yeah so then there's no like [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6142.78s)]
*  it's not like we can I mean we're going to try to push our our hydrocarbon fueled jet planes and [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6147.74s)]
*  rockets to go as fast as they can but they're not going to do what those things are doing right so [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6153.58s)]
*  it's more of a spiritual problem because you know it's it's I think it reminds us that we don't we [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6157.98s)]
*  just don't I mean the Fermi we don't know what's going on um the Fermi paradise by the way it's [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6162.78s)]
*  kind of wrong in the sense that he was like this huge universe where is everybody but of course like [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6166.46s)]
*  at that very moment is when when you're I mean 1952 is this is this period where this is huge ufo [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6172.7s)]
*  sightings in Washington DC they're scrambling jets to go chase them it's in this great James [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6179.42s)]
*  Fox documentary James Fox had another by the way I just wrote I wrote a piece on it actually for [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6185.9s)]

*  they want a commanding it's not a majority because they have multiple systems of a plurality of [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6890.78s)]
*  parties so they're going to basically they are the kingmaker for the senate and she's now [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6895.179999999999s)]

*  censorship they're sick of the top down stuff so I think we're seeing some really cool [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6939.74s)]
*  revolts of the public against the elites I think we're going to see more of it in the United States [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6945.66s)]
*  I think you're a big part of it Russell Brand Glenn Beck I look at these you know all these [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6950.7s)]
*  folks it's like look we all might disagree on some of the stuff but we would like to rule ourselves [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6954.46s)]
*  yeah we would like to have the ability to use our voice and have a debate rather than have [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6958.46s)]
*  renee di resta and the censorship industrial complex tell us what we should think right and [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6963.1s)]
*  censor us behind closed doors also we would like to have access to information so that we form our [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6967.9s)]
*  opinions based on facts yeah not based on propaganda it's like it's one thing I mean [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6973.26s)]
*  it would be one thing if they if there was like some real problem that is not being addressed [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6980.86s)]
*  because of misinformation but that's not the case no this is there's no evidence and no argument [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6988.139999999999s)]
*  whatsoever including during the covid crisis there's no argument whatsoever that it's in our [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6994.78s)]
*  best interests it seems to all align with money well and this thing where they use and power I [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=6999.82s)]
*  mean I just testified yesterday with the Stanford professor Jay Bhattacharya who was the co-author [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7006.3s)]
*  of the great barrington declaration beautiful human being by the way just separate from his own [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7012.62s)]
*  views but he was like look in a crisis you need more freedom of speech like when you're trying to [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7016.78s)]
*  figure out how to solve a fast moving fast changing problem that is not the time to be doing censorship [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7023.02s)]
*  that's the time you want more views more representation also there's like a standard [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7028.62s)]
*  thing that we should ask at any point in time when there's a dilemma and then someone is trying [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7033.26s)]
*  to control information is there money involved is your money involved yeah and if information [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7038.54s)]
*  got out in one way or another would it benefit or hurt someone and who is controlling that [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7046.7s)]
*  information and how right and if you can't ask those questions then money is just going to [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7053.58s)]
*  dominate that's right a big part of it is transparency yes I think that um I the thing [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7058.46s)]
*  we testified yesterday was just it's very hard like the social media platforms for a variety [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7063.26s)]
*  reasons you don't want the government regulating them but what you could do is just say every time [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7069.74s)]
*  the government demands something to change on the platform that government official has to file a [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7075.66s)]
*  public notice that they've asked for that so if the white house is going to say censor true stories [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7082.54s)]
*  of vaccine side effects to Facebook that government official must report that and it must become public [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7088.06s)]
*  right away which will both reduce the amount of it that occurs but also allow us to see it [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7092.700000000001s)]
*  and then secondly if Elon or Mark Zuckerberg or whatever are going to stop you know I think there [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7097.26s)]
*  was something going on with the trans shooting that we just talked about yesterday I'm just looking [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7101.900000000001s)]
*  into it like some censorship some folks being uh temporarily suspended it appears to be I haven't [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7106.22s)]
*  talked to is this an algorithm issue I don't know I don't know if you saw it I know Seth Davis from [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7113.18s)]
*  the federalist appeared to have been deplatformed or suspended briefly I literally haven't I have not [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7117.74s)]
*  talked to Elon or anybody about it so I don't want to make any accusations do we know what he said [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7123.66s)]
*  I don't know and I suspect I like you said I suspect it was an algorithm issue where they [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7127.9s)]
*  didn't want I think there was like a trans day of vengeance planned for Tennessee or something and [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7132.0599999999995s)]
*  this was all leading up to that so my point was just just have transparency on it you know like [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7137.34s)]
*  if Twitter is going to you know deplatform somebody or bounce somebody or censor some [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7143.9800000000005s)]
*  post because they don't want to contribute to real world violence and there are situations [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7149.580000000001s)]
*  where I think that might be appropriate just make it transparent just just tweet it out and let [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7152.9400000000005s)]
*  everybody know I think that that just that's this trishand effect there that's going to take over [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7157.1s)]
*  yeah although um I think it changes the it provides some context to it in other words [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7162.620000000001s)]
*  if if Elon and Mark Zuckerberg had to say hey you know what we're actually stopping this trans [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7167.18s)]
*  day of vengeance meme from spreading I think it's okay because they're actually able to explain [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7173.259999999999s)]
*  and talk about it then you can have comments and people responding to it transparency for me it's [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7179.099999999999s)]
*  not necessarily the silver bullet but it's the first thing we should do in order to it's it's [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7184.7s)]
*  more free speech it's actually is more more speech not censorship yeah I couldn't agree more I mean [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7190.139999999999s)]
*  we need people to be able to have an understanding of what is actually going on based on facts [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7197.58s)]
*  and if we deny that for their own good and if we deny that because it's it contributes to [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7204.46s)]
*  ex-hesitancy or ex-dis- you know we can't do that right it's gotta be about information it's gonna [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7210.54s)]
*  be and we have to treat everybody the way we would like to be treated ourselves I was I was gonna I [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7216.46s)]
*  didn't have a chance to use this line but I was gonna ask these these members of congress that [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7223.74s)]
*  were demanding more censorship I was gonna say what have you said in the past that you think the [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7227.099999999999s)]
*  social media companies shouldn't censor because if you can't name anything then all you're saying is [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7231.66s)]
*  that that they should censor views that you disagree yes the other one I think um you know [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7237.9s)]
*  I mean I think the other issue is that there's this famous quote people say you're entitled to [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7244.0599999999995s)]
*  your own opinion but not your own facts well that's bullshit you're entitled to your own facts too [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7247.9s)]
*  we can't agree on what a woman is right like our like literally look at the polling on it like [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7252.54s)]
*  like like democrats I think a majority of not I think a majority of democrats now say that like [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7258.46s)]
*  trans women are are real women majority of republicans say trans women are not real women [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7263.34s)]
*  we can't agree on what a woman is I mean Matt Walsh you had in here too he did a whole movie [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7271.26s)]
*  called what is a woman so so very good movie yeah so it's so fascinating to watch the mental [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7275.26s)]
*  gymnastics that people put themselves through to stay within the parameters of the ideology [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7280.7s)]
*  yeah I want people like for me I want to be able to express myself I want people I disagree with [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7285.58s)]
*  to express themselves they that's how it's how it's got to be yeah and I agree too I mean about [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7290.54s)]
*  everything like one of the things that Matt and I got into was about gay marriage and I'm like I [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7296.22s)]
*  wanted to hear his opinion on game I don't want to censor him I want to hear his opinion we talked [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7301.82s)]
*  about it for like 40 minutes and I'm like I don't understand you I don't understand why that [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7306.38s)]
*  bothers you I don't understand why you're saying that marriage has to be between a man and a woman [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7311.18s)]
*  and then he got into this argument about procreation and I'm like what about sterile [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7316.22s)]
*  females males and females that don't want children so they'd not be allowed to get married unless [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7319.9800000000005s)]
*  they want to have children like what are you saying like what do you think gay people should [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7325.02s)]
*  do do you think they should not be gay like and you you get them in this like weird sort of what [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7328.38s)]
*  about freedom like whatever do you think they're not gay like what do you think it's an act do you [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7333.18s)]
*  think that guys having sex with guys they're just doing it because it's like culturally accepted [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7338.14s)]
*  like is that what you think yeah because they've existed forever it's a real thing [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7342.38s)]
*  absolutely what do you what are you getting at here and it boils down to they believe their [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7346.700000000001s)]
*  religious ideology trumps your ability to create your own reality or to or have a reality that [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7351.9800000000005s)]
*  aligns with your beliefs and desires and your sexual orientation and whatever the [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7360.7s)]
*  fuck else you choose in life as long as it's not hurting other people and for the republicans [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7365.82s)]
*  that's like it was always small government stay out of people's lives but why not with gay people [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7370.86s)]
*  why are you fucking with gay people like why does that apply to everything except gays well I don't [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7377.179999999999s)]
*  get it that's why we're not conservatives yes but that's one of many reasons one of many reasons [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7382.78s)]
*  I think the thing that you're doing that is so important and so beautiful that's why you're the [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7387.82s)]
*  king of this and this why this medium is so important is that you're saying I don't understand [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7391.74s)]
*  what you're saying yes and I'd like to understand and then you actually achieve disagreement you [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7398.86s)]
*  don't know if you disagree because you haven't had a chance to talk about it and understand each other [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7404.86s)]
*  these sensors are not they're they're not doing that right they're they're saying that they're [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7411.26s)]
*  going to lose so they want to silence you yeah and they're saying I'm so sure that I'm right and [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7417.1s)]
*  you're wrong that we're not going to even have the conversation yeah we're not going to have the [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7421.1s)]
*  dot they view that they view you as a threat it's not because of your beliefs it's because this is a [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7425.18s)]
*  three hour long podcast platform for people to actually raise a bunch of threatening ideas [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7430.22s)]
*  but they're overreacting themselves because of course I mean look you have to have this is why [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7437.5s)]
*  I think there is some faith you know you do kind of go like we just there's a faith in which more [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7442.54s)]
*  speech is better yeah more speech is better for it's always better and they've and there's some [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7448.46s)]
*  that these sensors have lost faith in the American project they've lost faith in the [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7454.22s)]
*  enlightenment project I don't think they're even looking at it I think they're self-centeredly [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7459.58s)]
*  looking at this whole thing as like how do I win right people love to win this is one of the [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7464.46s)]
*  problems with prosecutors hiding evidence that would exonerate defendants yeah right it's people [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7470.14s)]
*  like to win yeah it's like cops plant evidence they want to win right when you make it a game [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7475.58s)]

*  ability to control people if we don't get a grasp on that we're going to fall into a situation [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7651.34s)]
*  that's very similar to what they have in China where you have a social credit score and a [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7655.66s)]
*  centralized digital currency and when I see people like Maxine Waters pushing us towards that [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7660.86s)]
*  direction and people talking about the first the first uh sounds of it were vaccine passports when [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7665.82s)]

*  to lead to a social credit score system that's going to lead to they're going to just there once [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7677.74s)]
*  they have the ability to make you have an app and that app gets to decide whether or not you [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7682.62s)]
*  travel they're not going to let that go there's no way they're going to let that go and once they [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7688.62s)]
*  have something like that attached to a centralized digital currency it's game over it's game over [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7693.42s)]
*  until something really big happens and that's what China's experiencing no for sure the social [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7699.34s)]
*  credit system is totally terrifying no I mean look I become way more libertarian yes I've worked on [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7704.54s)]

*  become much more paranoid um I mean when you go when you spend all this time in these documents [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7726.54s)]
*  and you see the way these guys kind of sneak around and they're trying to do all this stuff [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7731.34s)]
*  behind the scenes it's really um it is like you know I thought it was funny it was like yeah I [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=7735.42s)]

*  you want to date a latina you know whatever you can be gay and like it was not a big deal but it [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8134.219999999999s)]
*  also wasn't like you were like higher on some moral hierarchy or something right and so that's the [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8137.98s)]
*  problem with identity yeah like the political I mean I was an annoying politically correct guy [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8143.42s)]
*  in college but there was also some Gen X spirit of like hey we're kind of beyond all that bad [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8147.66s)]
*  60s shit you know we don't want to be there I mean John McWhorter also talks about it in [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8153.58s)]
*  woke racism where and where where it's like and he's a Gen Xer too where I think there is a I'm [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8157.5s)]
*  not saying it's the solution to all these problems but I think that that Gen X spirit that Breakfast [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8163.1s)]
*  Club spirit needs to come back into American culture I wish you hadn't said that what you [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8168.06s)]
*  wish I hadn't said that yeah just Breakfast Club spirit but um I said hey I'm the cringe one so [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8173.18s)]
*  that's what you're talking about like the Charlemagne radio show that Breakfast Club I agree there but [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8179.02s)]
*  what you don't like Breakfast Club the movie it's okay oh come on Joe it's not my thing okay [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8183.820000000001s)]
*  um but my my question is like when did you shift and become less politically correct like you were [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8189.900000000001s)]
*  politically correct in college what caused the shift for you you know it's funny you ask that I [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8197.98s)]
*  mean it was I was in San Francisco in the 90s doing kind of publicity campaigns for different [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8203.66s)]
*  progressive causes and I had some women I knew who were also very progressive and they came and they [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8210.06s)]
*  were like we want to come and do a diversity training for you and your staff and I was like [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8216.22s)]
*  why and they were like well it was like all the early implicit racism stuff and I just remember [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8222.06s)]
*  being like I don't think we're racists and I'm not going to do that and I think there was a bunch of [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8227.099999999999s)]
*  that happening grifters they're grifters and moralizers and they wanted to get some power over us [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8233.42s)]
*  and be paid I mean it's the beginning of all that bad diversity training stuff so I think it was [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8240.22s)]
*  that you know it was also on climate change once you kind of go climate change is just going to be [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8244.86s)]
*  solved by producing energy without carbon emissions like it's just a technical problem it's not like oh [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8251.26s)]
*  we all have to ride our bikes like I love riding my bike but it's like it became the moralizing and [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8257.02s)]
*  the woke culture I was just like this is bullshit there's also a stand there's also a thing that's [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8261.980000000001s)]
*  not being addressed about the climate is that it's never been static ever never in the history of [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8267.42s)]
*  the earth so this idea that climate change is going to be mitigated or that some somehow or [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8272.62s)]
*  another we're going to be able to control it like are you sure because it seems like ice ages have [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8278.380000000001s)]
*  always existed and great periods of melting global warming have always existed like whether or not [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8284.460000000001s)]
*  we're having an effect on it that's what we should say well what is our effect pollutants what are we [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8289.900000000001s)]
*  doing what's what are we doing that's negative but this idea that if you stop the earth is going to [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8294.380000000001s)]
*  stay like this it's not of course it's not it doesn't exist it's always like this it's up and [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8298.539999999999s)]
*  down it's all over the fucking place well the funny thing is we were probably headed towards an ice [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8303.98s)]
*  age yeah and then we our carbon emissions probably it appears to have reversed that which is good [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8307.98s)]
*  which is which is good and then you just don't want to get too far global cooling is way scarier [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8313.82s)]
*  than global warming and way more people die randall carlson told me that and i never even [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8319.099999999999s)]
*  thought about it until he said it and i was like yeah jesus christ you're fucked if everything [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8323.5s)]
*  freezes and he said there was a point in human history or a point in the history of the earth [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8328.06s)]
*  where things got so cold that we almost became inhospitable to life life as we currently [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8333.5s)]
*  understand it and know it yeah for sure i mean you know everything in moderation i mean yeah you [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8341.34s)]
*  just i mean you you don't want to change the temperature too much in any direction of course [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8347.019999999999s)]
*  so but i mean look it's like for me it's always been i think there's a bunch of complicated [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8351.9s)]
*  problems like social media and the culture but like energy it's pretty straightforward if you're [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8356.38s)]
*  using wood anything is better than that including coal if you're using coal natural gas is better [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8361.339999999998s)]
*  yeah and nuclear is even the best and basically the world has been moving in the direction from [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8368.3s)]
*  wood to coal to oil and gas to nuclear and that's the right direction and nuclear has always been a [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8373.5s)]
*  weird one because it brings with it the power to to make bombs but the the as an energy source [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8378.22s)]
*  it's amazing yeah so we just kind of over thinking and then the issue got not over thinking but really [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8384.46s)]
*  got hijacked by a bunch of you know opportunists that want to want to use it as a way to exercise [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8389.74s)]
*  control so for you you experienced these people that came along that were kind of grifters that [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8395.179999999998s)]
*  were saying we need to incorporate some and by the way you're talking about an like extremely [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8400.859999999999s)]
*  progressive liberal organization that you were part of oh which but you if there was any racism [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8405.099999999999s)]
*  start out like a sore thumb it's if anything like i mean you're you're promoting the complete [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8410.619999999999s)]
*  opposite of what they're trying to say yeah like by by giving you some training they're trying to [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8418.22s)]
*  find implicit racism or un or hidden racism or yeah well it gets back to that i think there's a [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8425.099999999999s)]
*  when you when you just abandon traditional religions in the traditional morality you want [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8432.619999999999s)]
*  to create i mean look even like i mean this bipoc thing is so interesting because it's like i was [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8437.74s)]
*  like what i remember finally somebody explained what is bipoc well that's black indigenous people [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8442.3s)]
*  of color literally in the word it's creating a hierarchy where it's black and indigenous people [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8446.14s)]
*  above you know latinos and asians who are just barely people of color right it's grotesque [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8451.18s)]
*  everybody hates it not everybody but most people i think actually hate it but it has this power [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8457.58s)]
*  because it's providing in fact this detransitioner i interviewed she was like the social justice [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8463.34s)]
*  she's like as she's autistic you know so she's autistic autism spectrum she was like as an [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8469.66s)]
*  autistic person and she's a lot of self-awareness and older now but she was like that social justice [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8473.34s)]
*  moral hierarchy provided some comfort like it was like a way to be like you know confusing you know [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8478.78s)]
*  she was uncomfortable with herself socially awkward i could kind of fit into this moral hierarchy and [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8485.26s)]
*  then be really dogmatic about it and then and then feel powerful feel in control have community [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8492.22s)]
*  so i think when you don't that's why i like reverting to like the older morality is first [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8497.98s)]
*  amendment morality right the older morality is is true anti-racism and that we don't think there are [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8502.939999999999s)]
*  human races much less that they can be put on a hierarchy this is what we want to get back to yes [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8508.46s)]
*  and that then that is the reality of biological human beings too yes the reality is it's one race [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8513.42s)]
*  we just adapted to different climates that's all it is we all came from africa yeah but what is [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8519.18s)]
*  specific so you experienced this and you you recognized these people were grifters and then [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8524.54s)]
*  like what moves you other than is the twitter files is that's the biggest shift in your becoming [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8529.74s)]
*  more libertarian yeah i mean the first big one was nuclear after you after you realize that nuclear [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8537.18s)]
*  is good not bad that's such a big one you know you're just like wow man because that's like [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8542.86s)]
*  already nuclear was the secular devil for those of us that grew up in this is connected to power [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8547.26s)]
*  weapons rather the day after and all the nightmares yeah and it's also connected to like three mile [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8552.78s)]
*  island yeah fukushima and yeah yeah i love these things i mean i think it's like you know it's [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8558.380000000001s)]
*  funny because of course we know that disconfirmatory information is dopamine depleting in other words [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8565.1s)]
*  like if we get proven wrong it's like depressing like yeah but there's another way after you get [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8570.78s)]
*  over it you're kind of like well that's cool like like nuclear is not what i thought it was like [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8575.26s)]
*  there's actually a moment of awe you know it's like seeing a ufo or being like oh my god we [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8579.66s)]
*  might not be alone there's something exciting about the excitement we need to get back in touch [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8585.66s)]
*  with the excitement that comes after you realize that you were wrong it's an it's an awareness of [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8590.300000000001s)]
*  some humility and that the world is more mysterious and wonderful than we than we had realized yeah i [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8595.1s)]
*  think there's also a really a great benefit in expressing to people that ideas are just ideas [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8599.82s)]
*  it's not you yes these are just some things that are bouncing around in your head and even if you're [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8607.42s)]
*  wrong it does it's like it's not a value judgment on you you should probably be wrong less than you [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8612.06s)]
*  are right you should probably be right much much more but it's very important that when you are [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8616.78s)]
*  wrong to acknowledge that you're wrong one of the worst things that happens to a public intellectual [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8620.78s)]
*  is when they are wrong and they refuse to admit they're wrong this is the sam harris dilemma [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8626.38s)]
*  like there's many people that are very brilliant people but they're in this trap where they can't [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8632.14s)]
*  say they were wrong and if you can't expose people to your thought process and why you made errors [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8637.9s)]
*  they're going to lose faith in your ability to discern the truth in the future and isn't it [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8645.98s)]
*  ironic that often those are the people that are always talking about being without ego it is it's [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8650.14s)]
*  i always notice it's like wow the people that talk so much about not having ego are [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8656.22s)]
*  the biggest egos it's it's just being a human man it's being a human and i think it's also [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8659.42s)]
*  just a sign of our ideologically driven times where where i think the divide between the right [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8667.18s)]
*  and the left and the the boundaries in between them are so wide now yeah it's so different i [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8673.26s)]
*  think that that thing too of where where again the abandoning traditional religions and adapting [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8678.859999999999s)]
*  his new morality i think people do start to play god a bit unconsciously yeah and they get real [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8685.74s)]
*  self-righteous and really i think it's great to i mean i don't i don't know how to do it but for [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8689.9s)]
*  me it's always like just we're all gonna die you know like just let's pause for a minute like we're [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8694.22s)]
*  going to die and not only that this is the stoicism is so good at this you know it's [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8699.98s)]
*  it's memento mori oh my god they're right there um you know it's a these are like you have like [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8705.74s)]
*  six of them um they're amazing it's like this is that's you very soon yeah so what the fuck are [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8712.06s)]
*  you gonna do between now and then for the people listening he's pointing to these skulls that are [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8718.86s)]
*  on the table really cool yeah these are all from this guy jack of the dust who's a uh an artist [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8722.22s)]
*  they're not real skulls you are real skulls no these are just their their resin he makes these [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8726.7s)]
*  but we'd be a lot better i think there's some way when you remind some people of their deaths they [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8732.06s)]
*  get kind of reactionary and smaller but other people i think there's a moment it's like yeah [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8736.3s)]
*  like so what am i gonna like like this is it like what are you doing now and what kind of a person [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8740.54s)]
*  do you want to be and what kind of a life do you want to lead my friend peter atia um he introduced [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8747.02s)]
*  me to this thing called uh your life in weeks and each week you scratch one off and you look at you [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=8752.7s)]

*  that we're going to do as a society and it's this collective well any resistance to that puts you in [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9606.140000000001s)]
*  this anti-vaxxer category which is like one of the worst pejoratives in modern world times like the [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9611.02s)]

*  don't want them to be coerced yeah children are so malleable you can get them to join cults you can [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9667.5s)]
*  get them to believe that they have to strap a suicide vest on and walk into a crowded courtyard [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9672.94s)]
*  there's things that you can get children to do that you're not going to get older people to do [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9679.5s)]
*  yeah and to to influence them to make a permanent change on their body that will sterilize them [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9683.82s)]
*  and also prevent them from experiencing sexual pleasure excuse me bless you it's i just go off [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9691.82s)]
*  that time it's fucked i mean it's yeah it's and it's it's attached to an ideology so because it's [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9699.26s)]
*  attached to this ideology it has to be universally and blindly supported yeah and i just think i [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9705.66s)]
*  it'd be nice to get beyond i mean it's funny because there's a bit of a arms race with the [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9711.42s)]
*  language where you know like they say they just accuse their opponents of being racists climate [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9715.82s)]
*  deniers anti-vaxxers election deniers you know and if you're kind of like hey can we move beyond [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9722.62s)]
*  these reductive labels they still have the advantage because these labels are so powerful [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9728.22s)]
*  they're so powerful it's so tricky it's similarly like where where they were like i was kind of [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9734.06s)]
*  like i don't even use this language of disinformation you know gretta tunberg is a [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9738.699999999999s)]
*  purveyor of disinformation the world is coming to an end in a few years yeah five years ago she said [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9743.099999999999s)]
*  yeah aoc she had to delete that tweet aoc said aoc says the world's ending 12 that's that's [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9747.98s)]
*  disinformation but i don't like do we have to go and call it that or can you just be like you were [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9753.42s)]
*  wrong and well you're not just wrong you're you're spreading fear that's unnecessary yeah and it's [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9757.74s)]
*  not based on facts and it's only there to support your narrative you're saying it to support your [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9763.9s)]
*  narrative and it makes you less reliable and you shouldn't do that yep i think there's also that [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9768.86s)]
*  thing about the um and jordan makes this point about the there's also the online i mean it's [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9773.9s)]
*  much harder to to demonize somebody when it's this yes when we're in person right and i can see the [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9778.3s)]
*  as we say you see the god in you see the god in me much harder whereas like online you've already [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9784.86s)]
*  is dehumanizing by nature and so labeling your opponents and demonizing them well that's why [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9791.1s)]
*  like like the matt walsh conversation imagine if matt walsh and i had that conversation on twitter [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9797.34s)]
*  oh i'm gonna take months you couldn't yeah you can't do it wouldn't work it wouldn't no one would [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9801.74s)]
*  ever achieve an understanding of what the other person thought and it would also be like probably [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9806.060000000001s)]
*  pretty nasty right which i don't think is necessary like i i can disagree with someone [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9810.46s)]
*  and and have a conversation with them and just just talk to them right but then there's also [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9814.939999999999s)]
*  people that are like really they're bad actors and they're only saying something because it [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9819.9s)]
*  conforms to their ideology and they're essentially grifters they've attached themselves to this thing [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9825.26s)]
*  and that was that is their business we could say they're lost souls yeah they're lost souls that's [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9831.26s)]
*  a good way of putting it i mean it's slightly sweeter i mean michael you're such a positive [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9836.62s)]
*  person well it's it's good to talk to you i mean i'm a bad i mean the you know why the part of the [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9841.02s)]
*  reason i came back to being a christian is that christianity i came back to actually while [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9845.660000000002s)]
*  working on gretta tunberg at the end of my book apocalypse never and i was like what's the remedy [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9849.900000000001s)]
*  for this intense hatred and anger against civilization and i was like it's love obviously [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9854.78s)]
*  loving your enemies like is for me what christianity is about like it's the heart of christianity [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9862.619999999999s)]
*  it's really hard forgiveness yeah forgiveness yeah it's it's but it's it's really really hard [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9869.02s)]
*  and so for me it was like i'm interested in having a faith that's hard not easy if it were easy then [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9875.02s)]
*  what's the point you know it's got to make you better in some way i get the same thing out of [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9882.46s)]
*  stoicism i find it completely compatible or these death meditations you do it not because [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9887.42s)]
*  it's wonderful to think about being dead you do it because you think it's gonna you know it's [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9892.7s)]

*  it makes the rest of your day easier it really does it's the day there are occasional days very [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WK4sRwHg9Y&t=9954.22s)]
