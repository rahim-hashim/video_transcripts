# Joe Rogan Experience #1394 - Matt Farah
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 06, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imi5ODmIckw)
*  Three two I gotta get a picture of that
*  Matt fair ladies and gentlemen Joe Rogan we're going live are we dude the interior of your car is fucking disgusting
*  I can't believe you like it. Why would you do that when you can get any interior?
*  You could make it any color you decided to do. What is it bus? It's city bus fabric city legitimately
*  It's actual city bus fabric. Yeah. Yeah, if we got it from the city bus supply I
*  Like just like puke resistant or something. It's everything resistant UV dirt staying. Yeah. Yeah
*  I but does it feel good? All right. Hi everybody. Hi
*  I have an old 9-eleven. It's called a Safari build this guy named Lee Keane built it and I showed it to Joe
*  I brought it here. There it is and these people on the video. We're looking at the smoking tire on Instagram
*  Thank you, and that's my everyday car in LA. You drive that everywhere
*  Yeah, it's got big fog lights and bash bars and it's got a man. Oh, yeah. Yeah in traffic
*  Yeah, but I don't I also have a little scooter so it's what I need to go fight traffic
*  I live yeah, you drive a scooter. Yeah, a little Yamaha 125. Oh geez, bro. You wear a fanny pack
*  I can ride a scooter. I mean for your own health. No, it's the best. It's the best
*  I mean look riding motorcycles is dangerous. We all know that but it I think it's a calculated risk
*  Yeah, you know and it like the other day my wife and I left the house at the same time
*  We live in Venice and she left in a car and I left on the scooter and like exactly like 40 minutes later
*  She I got off the bike and texted her that I was at my destination in Koreatown and she was at her destination in Culver City
*  so I was literally like
*  Double triple the distance that she had gone
*  so but anyway, the city bus fabric is amazing and I fully anticipated that
*  90% of the people would like it and 10% of the people would find it deeply offensive
*  I'm surprised that you fell into the offense disgusting. It's cool, man. It's gross. I mean, yes, it's not
*  Yes, it's fun. But it's fun that you did that. Yeah, I'm not offended
*  It's it is fun. Yeah, and I you know here in LA a car is kind of like, you know your outfit a little bit
*  You know a little bit. Yeah, you're showing a little jazz a little bit and I like I like to if I'm gonna put a message
*  Out there of myself in a car, right?
*  I don't want to be like
*  Some douchey shitbag in a Porsche like I want to be the guy who's in like a pink Porsche
*  With big tires on it and it's kind of bus interior, you know that's me
*  And it says a little more about me than it does about
*  Porsche is a weird car right Ferrari is a hundred percent douchebag
*  They take themselves very seriously really hard to not be a douchebag in a Ferrari
*  Well, although I did see a really interesting one that this guy built in England where he took a Dino
*  Oh, yeah, and he put a 400 plus horsepower and modern Ferrari engine in it and put like a clear
*  Glass over the engine bay and and everything you could take off and bring the car back to stock
*  It was I found almost those sort of singerization of a Dino
*  So the Dino is one of the prettiest Ferraris ever right?
*  But if you've ever driven one they sound great, but they're just slowest dog. Yeah, there's the v6 is it's for the smallest engine
*  Ferrari ever made what did you know the the website for the guy that did it or the YouTube channel?
*  I think the guy I think his name was David Lee and he built it and it's I think he claimed it was an f40 engine
*  Which I don't think was entirely accurate. I think I think he exaggerated a little bit
*  I think I think it's a it's an engine from like a 360 that has been modified in certain ways
*  40 has more than 400 horsepower. Well, it also had turbos and you just it's not like you just wouldn't use an f40 engine for that
*  It would just be it would be like using
*  Something that's very valuable and not really replaceable force for four purposes of modification
*  Doesn't make much sense when other options are available that could deliver you the same result like a 360
*  What did it 360 have when it came with the Modena like 400 horsepower? Yeah, look around 400
*  Dino's gotta be like what is it? You know was like your pounds. Yeah, maybe maybe they're tiny
*  They're tiny and they're made of nothing. I mean they're
*  2500 is maybe a good number. They're little wild. Yeah, and if you've I've heard that car that car lives here
*  Really? Yeah, that car lives in Los Angeles the black one. Yeah. Yeah, it lives here. I've seen it in our shows
*  Yeah, that's gonna sound
*  Nice it's weird because you actually have to yes
*  Is a half a million dollars would be a very low estimate for that car
*  Maybe a really good original Dino is there it is. So it's actually
*  That's not the car because the car has a hard top or is it a target? It's a target
*  Oh, look how pretty it is. It's better with the roof off in that picture with the back end of it right there
*  Yeah, so what's so interesting about cars?
*  It's actually hard to tell it apart from a regular Dino
*  If you don't know what you're looking for the things to look for obviously that badge on the left that says like Evo
*  Something and then the clear engine cover with the big bubble in the middle of the of the engine bonnet is changed
*  Yeah, by the way that badge can go fuck itself. The badge doesn't need to be there. Yeah
*  The exhaust is a little bigger. I like the exhaust. I like these are that's fine. I wish they had some grip to the tires
*  Those are some skinny ass bitch ass tires. Well, look how narrow I mean, you know, you're talking about a car that
*  Without widening the body. There's only so much you can do I imagine a modern rubber compound
*  What they did was they reproduced the Dino's I think they're camping Yolo wheels
*  Which were probably like 15s on the Dino and I think they're of 17s here
*  So pretty that you want to talk expense. Yeah, David Lee the Monza 3.6 Evo Dino
*  So 3.6 that's what tells me it's a modem 360 engine
*  Yeah, it was if it was a 40 engine be a 2.8 liter engine. Yeah with turbo with turbos
*  God that's a pretty car, which by the way if it had an f40 engine it'd be a fucking death trap
*  You would sail that thing
*  With 400 horsepower, it's got to be crazy. Yeah, you know what? It's it's gonna be linear right without the turbo spool
*  Yeah, you know you have that natural build of power and you really kind of can just use less throttle
*  It won't just jump out at you. Yeah, but I mean you are a man of taste Joe. That's awesome
*  It's a beautiful ride. Look at that thing. They're selling them
*  Yeah, they're trying to build a run of them, okay, I think they're like singer yeah, yeah
*  Yeah, well, here's the problem with with with doing this with Ferraris though
*  Ferrari people
*  Even if you did something to the level of singer Ferrari people aren't really like that Ferrari people are
*  originality over
*  Everything that's so weird. Yeah, I don't know they don't like they don't like modifying the cars
*  They don't like a car that's previously been modified. It's all about the numbers matching shit
*  No, it's not it's not for you. No, no, it's not really for me either
*  I love driving the Ferraris, but like I don't align with like that the Ferrari fan really values so much
*  But I'd like to own one soon. Maybe 80s one. Well, it's a little silly like a tester. Oh, so I've driven test rosas are fun
*  Yeah, Dana White has a test. Oh, that's great. Yeah completely redone. He's like fuck you
*  We put a new interior and a modern stereo everything it's probably nice. They need a lot of maintenance though. They have
*  Tester roses have timing belts see timing belts are something that
*  Italians were doing for a long time and the people they should should just never be done again
*  It sounds terror they wear out and they need to be changed and in the case of the Tester Rosa
*  You're talking about a giant flat 12 engine. They're in the front
*  So they're up against the firewall behind the seats
*  So you have to take off the whole back of the car and take the whole engine out of the car to do these timing
*  Oh, yeah
*  starting with
*  The modern stuff they use chains
*  They brought that into the 21st century and they don't have to fucking fuck with belts anymore
*  Yeah, but even like Lamborghini at the time like I have a Countach which is the best car ever made and
*  You don't have to do that bullshit because even Lamborghini used chains
*  So you don't need to do the engine out why did Ferrari go with belts? I think they thought it was smoother
*  For Enzo Ferrari also had utter contempt for the people who bought his street cars
*  And I wouldn't be surprised if he did it just so the dealers would make more money on the services
*  Even if he knew it was worse
*  Why did he have so much contempt for the people about his cars?
*  Enzo Ferrari just wanted to go racing all he he was an egomaniac and all he ever wanted to do was see his cars win
*  Races and he came to a point where he couldn't make money doing that and he had to sell
*  Street cars to customers but throughout his entire life. He openly
*  Treated those people with disdain that's how you win
*  That's the story of Lamborghini the story of Lamborghini is Ferruccio Lamborghini had a Ferrari
*  It was not working for one reason or another he went to Ferrari to complain about it
*  Enzo basically told me to fuck himself and so he said I'll build a better car and that's the story of Lamborghini
*  And there what are they owned by now?
*  Volkswagen Audi group yeah VA VAG so they're more reliable now. Yes, but so are
*  Ferraris around 2010 yes
*  When the the the the four or five eight came out
*  Ferraris took a massive jump in reliability how they do that
*  First off the big one is the dual clutch gearbox
*  Which you know stick shifts were one thing right and then these early single clutch paddle shift gearbox
*  They'd fry clutches like crazy people didn't really know how to use them right and they'd ride the clutches out and they would just go
*  Through clutches like crazy the dual clutch cars have much more
*  Like failsafe type stuff built into them and they actually work properly
*  But Ferraris have the gated shift those the best coolest thing
*  Yeah, clinkity clink the best sliding into gear
*  There's nothing more rewarding than like banging a Ferrari off the revlar
*  They stopped that people stopped
*  The problem with with Ferrari is that they're new you know with the problem with all new exotic the first owners of exotic cars is
*  They want that that new technology. That's that's from racing and
*  Also, it's like it's improved the drivability
*  You know if you want to buy a Ferrari or a Lamborghini and drive it around in the city and use it as like a car
*  You can buy a Ferrari right now, and it could just be your car like that was there
*  That wasn't a thing you could do really in the 70s or 80s or even 90s like you could literally use a modern
*  Exotic car be it Ferrari Lamborghini McLaren Audi. All right, whatever you that could be your only car now and
*  That the gearbox technology is a lot of what's made that possible and computer controlled like engine management systems
*  It's a little disappointing
*  One thing I'm really happy that Porsche hasn't done that but they have with the GT3 RS
*  G3 RS this this last year and now the new ones
*  What do you mean only automatic all automatic?
*  Well the RS though the RS is in in Porsche speak is the fastest version of what they can build
*  They have the GT3 touring with a stick. That's the one you want you want the touring
*  Why do I want the touring because it's fucking stick because the four-liter engine with us that six-speed gearbox is the best engine
*  Transmission combination available in cars today period. Yeah, but the wide-body
*  GT3 RS with the vented fenders and you can modify you can modify later
*  You just complained about people who don't want to modify now. You're complaining about modifying but all that extra effort
*  Why don't they just fucking sell to you with a stick shift? I don't know bro
*  Talk to the Germans. I can't fucking win their make look they make a GT3 with a stick
*  They do they make the Cayman GT4 with a stick. They make the boxer spider with a stick
*  You can buy a 9-eleven any level of 9-eleven with a stick
*  Well, you can buy the turbo not the turbo. They're the only ones you can count on though
*  It seems like it's all going away even Corvette the new Corvettes. Yeah clutch. Yeah, they said the new GT 500
*  They haven't ruled out the possibility. Yeah of having a stick shift, but well, so look with the GT 500
*  They just announced this thing. It's it's like 750 horsepower
*  Yeah, I've driven a lot of really powerful manual transmission cars for me once the car goes over about
*  500 I don't want to shift anymore really I
*  Don't when I'm driving it on like a racetrack as fast as it will go
*  Okay
*  Like when I went to test the the the Corvette zr1 the last front engine one when it went just completely fucking bananas, right?
*  750 horsepower I went to Road Atlanta to drive it and they had a manual and they had an automatic for me to drive and I
*  Drove the manual and it was so fucking fast
*  That I did not feel comfortable taking my hand off the wheel to do the shifts
*  And and I was like this level of performance I really need to have both my hands on the wheel and I'm a pretty decent
*  Driver, I'm not like shit. I'm not the best but I'm not shit right and then when I drove the automatic car I
*  Went okay. I feel way more comfortable at this pace with my hands on the wheel
*  but this eight-speed automatic they have is the biggest hunk of flaming shit ever put into a sports car and so with the
*  C8 with the new one they
*  got rid of the manual and
*  Decided to substantially improve the auto with a new dual clutch eight-speed which
*  You know for you and for me is sad that there's no stick
*  It's what I kind of get it because it's just sort of what progress looks
*  I get it if you're gonna take it to a racetrack. Yeah, I do get it
*  But how many people are taking their goddamn Corvette to a race, you know, it's not even really about that. It's sadder
*  It's sadder than that. It's really about how do we get the zero to sixty time under three seconds?
*  Because when they had the z06 which was 650 horsepower and then they had the ZR1 which was 750 horsepower
*  They couldn't get it to 60 any faster Detroit is still so suck in fucking zero to 60 that
*  That that is important for some reason and adding a hundred horsepower
*  Didn't change the zero to 60 because of the front engine rear-drive your distraction limited at that point just burnouts
*  Yeah, so by putting the engine in the back you change the weight distribution
*  Now you've got a dual clutch eight-speed instead of its
*  Manual seven-speed now you can get in that two second range to 60 which doesn't improve the experience
*  But it does improve the number on that magazine cover the number but everybody know I mean, how do you not know?
*  It's a just a fucking fast car. You know, it's fast the GT 500 is a real bummer though
*  Cuz that's a such a muscle car, you know, it's a savior muscle car
*  It's a it's a sense to same version of the Tremek dual clutch from the Corvette is in the Mustang
*  Yeah, it has a different number of gears incidentally
*  It has a set it's a seven speed in the Mustang and an eight speed in the Corvette
*  But it's same family of brand new Tremek dual clutch gearboxes. What has a wider contact with the tires?
*  I don't know what the Mustangs got if I had to guess it's narrower
*  Right, if I had to guess the Mustang had wider the C8 Corvette is 305 rears that I know
*  Yeah, it's not you know with a mid-engine car what is interesting about a mid-engine car as you find this a lot
*  I bet if you went out and looked at a Ferrari like a 458 or something
*  You'd be shocked at how narrow the tires are really?
*  Yeah
*  when you do a mid-engine car you can give up a lot of that huge fat rear rubber because the the weight distribution doesn't
*  Necessitate it weight a tire tire sizes are typically chosen by the weight distribution of the car. So like your 911
*  Your old air-cooled car your old one, right?
*  So you got big fat rears and you've got relatively skinny fronts. That's because that engine is over the rears
*  So in a mid-engined like I just looked this up for an unrelated thing in the 458
*  The front tires are only two forty fives on that and the rear tires are 305
*  So where is a Corvette your front tires are like two seventy five the old Corvette front tires are 275 rears like
*  335 that that difference in weight distribution is how big of a difference you need in tires
*  Weird sense the that's you know, have you driven the GT 500? No, I didn't get to do it yet. Unfortunately
*  It looks fun. Someone posted a video. It ran a 10 6 quarter mile out of the box. It's crazy
*  That's fuck. Is it not very very fast? I cannot believe
*  Some of the cars that people can just buy well speaking of which that Porsche that you sent me the video
*  Yeah, Tycon Tycon I gotta say right I can't Tycon Tycon
*  Yeah, we're gonna fuck that one up for years that thing looks preposterous
*  Cuz look, I know how preposterous my Tesla's I tell everybody when they say oh, you know
*  You have really fast cars might see that one right there. Yeah, the one that looks like a dad car
*  That's that one blows all and you can drive like a piece of shit cuz it's silent doing no one notices
*  You're so quiet past people like you just whiz by him. Yeah, nothing happened. Yeah, Tesla is the new
*  BMW in terms of people who are driving like shit bags on the way to work because when it's silent people don't like call the cops
*  Or sneer you're just kind of gone, dude
*  I was at a red light with some kid in a model 3 and I was in my GT 3 RS and he blew by me
*  Blue but I wasn't even trying to race him cuz I know better. Yeah have a Tesla, but it was the humiliation factor
*  He passed me and then got in front of me and then got on the highway
*  Like it was nothing and he an EV a fast EV if you live in Los Angeles is the correct tool for
*  For this job, you know if you have a home or in your case fucking sick warehouse to keep it charged
*  You know supercharger networks pretty good. Yeah, but it's not I wouldn't say you can use it exclusively
*  You need some some kind of home base to charge. Yeah or your office
*  But um people that live in apartment complexes that have Tesla's I don't know how you do it
*  Yeah, if you don't live in a building where you can get them to install on or you work in a building
*  Yeah, something. Yeah, you really EVs are amazing and they're super super fun
*  And like I totally get why people like like I I get your EV
*  Evangelism transformation you having gone from the but at the top of the brought up at the top, you know analog school of
*  You know manual gearboxes and fucking loud to to to experience that level of silent performance
*  You must have felt like you're in a fucking spaceship. It's seen it still seems like a spaceship. Yeah drive that thing
*  Yeah, quiet. Yeah, it makes me feel good though. Well, do you find the yeah you get a little more relaxed, right?
*  Yeah, I like it when I take it to the airport too cuz I put it on auto
*  I go to do and I get on the 405 and I just chill in traffic. It's nice. Oh, no, it's nice
*  It is I totally get it be careful with oh, I have my hand on the wheel
*  No, no, it does be careful saying it drives itself. It doesn't can't it doesn't drive itself. Does it do?
*  Here the rabbit hole begins it has it has an advanced drivers aid system
*  Okay, so it has follow, you know falls a car in front of you and it has a pretty good lane. Keep assist, right?
*  But now we go into the Joe Rogan rabbit hole of what does driving mean?
*  so driving involves decision making and
*  Driving involves a lot of mental processes that cars can't do and so that's when I when people talk about
*  Terms like self-driving cars or full self-driving or whatever
*  They're not usually using those terms correctly
*  So a bunch of cars not just Tesla right now, although Tesla system is very good
*  Have a very good lane. Keep assist and a very good radar cruise system and they have different methods of trying to ensure the drivers paying attention
*  But I think the marketing is a little bit disingenuous and they really want
*  people who don't know
*  Better to think and feel like this is a car that drives. It's kind of putting it on beta. It's all just beta
*  Fucking dangerous
*  Bro, I'm riding my chain shooter
*  I know I just had a model 3 for a week like a couple weeks ago and I liked it so much and I gave it
*  Back and I went god, maybe I should lease one of these. This is cool. But the auto steering feature
*  I use it for about 20 minutes and it scared the piss out of me twice
*  You seen that company called axis that takes a model s and they put a carbon body
*  Wide body kit onto it. No, it sounds like fun though. It's pretty dope the axis
*  Model s p 100 100 D is they replace the entire body with carbon
*  They take the hood they take the fenders off to put wide body fenders on they they do a bunch of different shit to it
*  You know, you're gonna do this. I don't think so. I wouldn't I wouldn't fuck with that
*  Yeah, they fuck with the suspension. They tighten up the suspension
*  They change the wheels and they completely redo the interior. They strip the interior. That's where I would start
*  Yeah custom interior put it put in whatever you want need for I the the you know
*  Teslas are there's such cool cars and they're such, you know, they're such like you said serene
*  You know what I mean?
*  and all not I don't want to give that credit exclusively to Tesla because other EVs provide a similar experience too, but
*  The one place they're lacking for the amount of money they charge their interiors are a little behind you
*  I'm asked me if I'm getting one of those trucks
*  Bro, good luck. Ask me if I'm gonna want to talk to you get in the top gap
*  Why you asking course? I'm getting one of them trucks. Yeah, look at that thing. You don't like it. No, you don't like it
*  No, I don't I don't like it and I how dare you I'm not entirely sure it's it's real
*  I mean, I think I think I
*  Mean look my initial reaction to that was that's not a real thing me George Jetson
*  Does it and my second reaction is I'm pretty sure they couldn't build and sell that in America why?
*  that because I I just I just
*  Don't think that that will pass the tests that it needs to pass
*  And I and furthermore more more like crash tests pedestrian safety stuff like that
*  furthermore, it's it's it's because
*  How do I say this without it's really hard to talk about Tesla because their fans are fucking crazy
*  They get really mad and they don't leave me alone about it crazy
*  In the beginning I thought that it's complete bullshit and fake and a fraud. I've talked to sent a few
*  people since in the design space who design cars professionally for a living and I
*  have been convinced that it could be possible to build and sell a
*  Shape a vehicle shaped sort of like that, although not exactly like that. Okay
*  Having said that I think that the way that it has been marketed is not entirely
*  Honest
*  People company show concept cars all the time, right? There's nothing wrong with showing a concept car
*  There's nothing wrong with going here's a here's a prototype we built and this is going to show the direction of our industry
*  Right, and if you build electric cars as your business
*  It's pretty easy to build a concept car that runs and drives because you've got your skateboard and you can just you know
*  Put any body on it, right? So odds are there's like a Model X chassis underneath that prototype truck, right?
*  But there's a one. I don't think that accepting reservations is an honest thing to do
*  When you don't know how you're gonna build the truck don't know there's no way that trucks on the road next year
*  No way not as I'm supposed to know the road next he did he said 20 he said next year 20 21 20 20 23
*  full three motor
*  500 range
*  Badass one is like a three year down the line thing. Here's the problem building cars and
*  Warranty them repairing them selling them is like a logistics business
*  They're operating this company like a tech company where it runs on hype like where's the roadster that's supposed to come out this year
*  When is that coming out? I don't know. I haven't seen anything about it. It's a prototype. Yes. Give me a guess. I
*  Don't know. That's the point. I don't like they've had these product launches and they build up the hype
*  It juices the stock they take the reservations, but then it's like but you have to deliver the product guys
*  You're you're actually a car company. You're not you're not exclusively driven on hype
*  But they have made some cars, of course. No, of course. They made your there's one here. Yeah
*  Yeah, no, I'm not saying they don't build and sell cars. They build and sell cars
*  But what I am saying is their business model is not
*  Like the regular car companies in that it is so dependent on this hype machine
*  Bringing in new investors bringing in new reservation cash when they go. Here's this crazy
*  Total recall space truck and all it's gonna cost you people to buy into my space truck vision is
*  $100 refundable and you're not gonna find out if that hundred dollars gets you a truck for like two and a half years
*  Are you gonna go after your hundred dollars if he's late or it's it's your but I'm not saying you shouldn't buy
*  Whatever he sells isn't the roadster thing a different deal though. Don't you have to pay all the money or something?
*  There is a reservation process
*  All I'm saying like the roadster thing was different though, like that requires a substantial sum of money, right?
*  But we don't we haven't seen any roadsters either
*  We saw the prototype yeah, but it's easy to build a prototype when you're Tesla that's looking build a prototype very easily
*  They've got an electric skateboard. They can put any body on it. It'll look and feel like a mostly run-and-drive car
*  Let's say here
*  45,000 five thousand dollar credit card payment plus 45,000 our wire transfer due in in ten days
*  Yeah, so you got to put up
*  50,000 dollars so you're giving him a zero interest loan of
*  $50,000 until he delivers this product which is like a good income for a lot of people for a year
*  Yeah, and you gotta give it up correct and so and I'm not saying that they don't build and sell real cars
*  I'm not saying you shouldn't buy one or lease one. I am saying and this goes for let's let's expand this
*  I'm not this isn't a dig at Elon or Tesla specifically. Let's talk about all cars
*  Don't pay for something that isn't then handed to you. Mmm. There's no Elan's a billionaire
*  Why do you need to give him a zero interest loan of fifty thousand dollars for a roadster?
*  Why do you need to give him a zero interest loan of a hundred dollars for a truck that he hasn't demonstrated?
*  He could build yet. Why do you think they made the roads to fifty grand and
*  The down payment for the truck only a hundred bucks because I will tell you why because why I believe I believe I'm gonna
*  Put this and I believe okay, okay
*  I believe it's so they could go to a bank or a VC because if it's only $100 you get you get so many
*  Hundred thousand orders you go. I've got two hundred and fifty thousand orders. I need a billion dollars. That's why you would do that
*  Cuz look here's the problem is if if it's legitimate, okay
*  If it's all on the up and up if everything is on the up and up
*  There's a lot of individual pieces that don't really add up right and on a house that's not made of you know
*  It's like imagine them the mortgage crisis in a way you took all these bad mortgages and you put them together and all of a
*  Sudden it's considered a good investment, right? So
*  He smashed the fucking window on stage
*  He quoted a bunch of power and torque figures that are basically made up
*  He did that dumb video with tug-of-war the f-150 that was completely fake
*  Why is it fake the f-150 was in two-wheel drive and he was towing it uphill
*  That's not like if you're gonna make it easier for the car to drive downhill than uphill
*  It no towing uphill
*  Well, it would be the weight transfer is is if you have a two-wheel drive pickup truck going downhill
*  My friend Jason Fenske at engineering explained did a whole video explaining debunking this but if you have an all-wheel drive
*  Extremely heavy vehicle because let's be honest if they build that truck, that's a 6500 pound vehicle steel and batteries
*  right all-wheel drive
*  Versus a pickup truck that's put into two-wheel drive with no weight in the bed, right?
*  That's just so it's like all automakers
*  Make up silly games to show up their product right that tow the space shuttle or whatever bullshit they do, right?
*  But they make up a game. They know they can win. They don't make up a game and then cheat at it
*  right
*  Like why are you gonna do a tug-of-war video if you then have to cheat at the video on video?
*  To do it like pick a different game, you know, you can win
*  What kind of a person makes up a game and then cheats at it?
*  Like that's just well your Ford wanted to get one of their own they're like well
*  Why don't you give us one of your Tesla's? Yeah, and then somebody up it up at the top said don't engage that idiot
*  What are you doing? I'm not doing this. Yeah, so look again
*  Well, they probably can't live realistically it can't really compete with it I
*  Think I think a tug-of-war test is not it's not a test of anything. It's a test of weight and tire grip
*  That's it. But when you a truck guy, you gotta realize the thing they do truck
*  Bro, let's bring that let's bring that cyber truck over to a gravel pit and dump two tons of
*  Did you see any like other renderings of people like camping in the cyber truck looks absurd well, yeah
*  It just like dude like you want to fucking you know, you want to buy one wait till he says
*  This is the one you can buy. I haven't put an order in. Yeah, I just I don't think would I don't think bucks
*  Congratulations, you just bought into the scam. That's that's that's you know what I mean
*  I
*  Think it's like a full-on fraud
*  I just think he's figured out creative ways to to get the public to bankroll shit
*  Yeah, that he already said was done bro a million robo taxis by 2020. Where's the robo taxis, bro?
*  Is that what he said? Yeah, this cyber truck thing came out of seemingly nowhere
*  But right kind of at the same time that they figured out that full self-driving is not right around the corner as they said
*  It was a lot of backtracking going on in the full self-driving
*  Level five is not coming anytime soon. You're not gonna be able to send your Tesla out
*  To do errands for you without a driver in it anytime soon
*  What was the parking with Tesla promises 1 million robo taxis? Yeah from 2019 for yeah
*  I mean technically they have a year in a month left, but they have delivered zero robo taxis
*  He did he said that shit man
*  Yeah
*  My problem with Tesla's Elon says some shit that then is impossible and then they have to figure out how to do it later
*  And sometimes doesn't work. Do you know who Kyle Dunn again is?
*  No, who's that one of the funniest guys alive?
*  He's got the best Instagram on the planet and he does face swaps
*  His video you you now that you know you didn't know the deep fake. I know he does a lot well, dr. Fakenstein
*  Oh, that's the one yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the faking ink. That's the one. Yes newest one
*  Give me some volume on this give me some volume on this and go to full screen
*  Yeah, oh my god, how creepy
*  Fucking shit. Oh great idea long do it again same window same ball. This should go differently
*  Fucking shit
*  Now I mark Zuckerberg is officially cooler than you know I'm cooler. I make rockets. That's cool
*  Well, I connect the world through Facebook. I'm cool. I'm double cooler double
*  I'm infinity. Oh my god infinity plus one. That's one more cooler
*  You can't add anything to infinity you only a nerd who's uncool would know that
*  Very uncool
*  This is too real the data and I found this invention you unveiled in high school
*  It senses if you're getting a boner class and then to plunge this over you
*  Letting everyone know you don't have a boner. That's pretty cool. Pretty cool. I know I could use this at Miss Tinsley's class
*  She got great boobs great boobs Miss Tinsley great boobs
*  Fucking weird that smashing the glass is one of the was one of the greatest moments in automotive history
*  So stupid I was laying in bed and my wife was next to me asleep and I have nowhere
*  Why did they think that they could do that I don't know
*  That's one of them that there's I know this idea was that when they hit the wall or hit the door with the hammer
*  That it broke the glass or no first they do is gonna hit the door with a sledgehammer
*  They did that but except he was using an orange hammer, which is a dead blow hammer. Not a sledge hammer
*  So that's a little disingenuous dead blow. Yeah, it's designed to not dent things. It's assigned to hit things without such a rubber. Yes
*  But still he said the windows were regular Tesla door probably because they're aluminum but not a thing
*  Stainless steel panel, right? I wouldn't dent a stainless steel panel and then he goes the windows are bulletproof
*  It's steel Paul right through it and then he puts up a video the next day that's like oh here was us testing it right before
*  The reveal where it actually worked show that it worked before why did it work?
*  How do you know the video was made before and not after after they fixed it?
*  There's a shop vac on the floor and a towel over the door as if you had just cleaned up a bunch of broken glass
*  That's true. Yeah, go look at the video. There's a shop vac on the floor with the hose laid out like right underneath the door
*  Yeah, that's true towels over a door kind of maybe if you had just smashed a bunch of glass out of it
*  That is a dope looking car I don't give a fuck what anybody thinks I don't care
*  I'm glad you don't carry things in if they make that I will be and can I just bring up?
*  What is the word cyber like cool now? Yes, like cyber was exclusively cool for like the last 15
*  No, no, no again. They're cool
*  They're cool only nerds only a real nerd wouldn't know that cyber is cool cool plus one
*  It's so silly well you saw I'm sure you've seen that rezvani. Oh my god Terry
*  bulletproof car that releases tax
*  Electrifies the door you know I was a really bad
*  Resonance I was at the gas station once pumping gas and this fucking rezvani pulls up
*  I'm like who is driving that fucking thing the tiny socks jumps out he goes. What's up?
*  Is he a spokesman he's got to be a spokesman or something um I think he's friends with the guy
*  Who and the guy gave it to him or something that's hysterical. I don't he's a spokesman
*  I met Oscars making Grammys got no time to be a spokesman for a tank. That's hilarious
*  I drove this company's other car. They have a car called the beast the rezvani beast
*  Oh, let me see what that I drove it it wasn't good
*  No, well the beat the tank is the beast is based on an aerial atom. Why do you know what that is?
*  Yeah, yeah, three-wheeled thing or no
*  Yeah, so good right so good. No so Jamie the red one with no roof
*  Oh my god, so that's the one I drove. It's not good. It's not it looks good
*  So what they've done there is they took an aerial atom which is a car that has no body all right, right?
*  It's like driving a fucking sled basically, and they're crazy. They're batshit
*  Yeah, and they've made body work that goes over it. That's pretty much what they've done
*  Okay, but in order to make it look kind of badass like a supercar
*  They made they put these really wide wheels and tires on the car
*  Yes, which when you have an aerial atom that has no power steering and a very
*  dialed in and and even sort of twitchy steering rack
*  This thing had one of the sketchiest
*  I mean the sketchiest handling of top five sketchiest handling cars I've ever driven look at the doors
*  Yeah, it's a real interesting kind of door design. I've never seen one that had those doors slide that looks CGI ish
*  No, I think the reverse minivan door go back to that black one. Yeah
*  It does look pretty cool. It's a it's a badass looking thing, but it's it's um, it just didn't drive good
*  Oh, and the guy got kind of mad at me when I made a video saying that it didn't drive good
*  I'm mad at you. You got a little mad
*  You're gonna only promote his thing for free. I think sometimes they expect that yes, that's really silly
*  You got to do a better job of making a thing
*  I think now I just send him to the tycan review. Yo, hey look at this
*  We should talk about this. I think good because we talked about two seconds and got away from your videos insane
*  It looks like you're about to fly off the road and into space. It is might be a problem
*  So it actually is I think I think we're at a point. Yeah, really where cars are actually too fast
*  I think to sell to regular people. Well, I think that all the time and I made that argument about the ZR one
*  Yes, it's so sketchy to drive with the rear-wheel drive. Yeah, I'm like you're selling it
*  150 horsepower car to someone like me
*  Yeah, who at least I know how to drive you are probably in the top 20% of people in terms of driving a billion
*  I can drive a little yeah, there's a lot of people that get those
*  They don't know what happens when you stomp on the gas and go sideways it like that fucking poor guy and Kevin Hart
*  You know when I saw that and I saw the fucking lines on the street
*  Yeah, and then off it's I'm like this guy doesn't know how to drive one of those
*  Let someone do that yeah hellcat engine a rear-wheel drive car is a Cuda right like a 70
*  Yeah, double the horsepower of stock. I bought my 70 coup I heard you did. Yeah. Congratulations very much
*  You're gonna make it handle sending it to roaster shop. Oh, yeah. Perfect. They'll do they'll do a good job
*  Yeah, yeah, but but with that with Kevin's crash. He was not driving right?
*  No
*  No
*  driving friend was driving and his friend stomped on the gas and the car went fucking sideways and he didn't know what to do
*  Yeah, you just can't do that with regular folks you got if you're gonna have a car like that. Yeah, you gotta say hey, man
*  You ever driven a real muscle car before yeah, how about one with?
*  750 fucking horsepower you can't do that man
*  You can I think a Cuda is probably five or six hundred pounds lighter than an Hellcat to probably really light and really gnarly and
*  You know with those with those custom builds like that. Mm-hmm. You know, it's it's it's hard
*  I think someone's suing that the shop that built it there is really unfortunate because yeah
*  It's like they're suing because of the waist belts no roll cage all that shit
*  I think that I hope I you know
*  I hope they don't win because if they do it's a really bad scene for custom cars all over but even brand new cars
*  You know, I just had a McLaren 720
*  Which is my favorite supercar on the moment at the on the market right now
*  And this thing is is 800 horsepower a demon of a car. Have you driven one? No, I've seen them fucking crazy
*  Dude, I was at Auto Club Speedway the the NASCAR track 180 miles an hour on the front straight
*  I mean, yeah, and and if you turn away
*  3100 pounds. Yeah
*  That's me that's me get about to get black flagged for drifting and attract
*  Yeah, they don't like when you're drifting in track days if you said it was a mistake
*  I didn't know how much horsepower I got black flag only for tenth slide
*  Do it once you can be like I'm managing the throttle when the when the smoke is wafting across
*  But with that car
*  Joe that car is in my opinion the pinnacle of
*  gasoline powered streetcar performance
*  That's a strong state. I think I've never driven cuz you know why it's not just that it's batshit fast
*  Cuz a lot of their cars are batshit fast to although very few are this fast it has this magic suspension technology
*  It doesn't have sway bars, you know sway bars were yeah, so you can put a stiffer sway bar in your car
*  It makes it roll less in corners. So typically you have to trade off, you know roll and compliance for
*  stiffness and performance right the 720 does not use sway bars instead it uses an
*  electronically actuated independent valve system that
*  allows you to mimic an
*  infinite number of sway bar combinations in between you know full stiff and
*  Non-existent so when you put the car into comfort mode
*  I'm I shit you not it rides like a Rolls-Royce like a Rolls-Royce not even like a 5-series
*  BMW or your Tesla like a Rolls-Royce and then you crank it to track and you go full de Rift Oh
*  And it's just bonsai time how much is one of those that one is a spider so it's
*  450,000 you can buy them used the problem with McLaren's and buying them new is they depreciate like crazy
*  So you can buy almost exactly the same car like two years old for like 250 really yeah that much
*  Yeah, oh my god didn't style bender buy one of those he bought a McLaren, but did he buy that model?
*  Do you know style benders? No, who's that? The name sounds familiar. You have seen midway champ. Oh cool
*  motherfucker I
*  Tried to I've tried to listen to so much of your fighting shows. I can't I'm just not that into it. I get it
*  It's okay. It's alright. It's okay, but you're in the last shit. Oh, yeah. He's got a 720 there
*  It is that car. Yeah, that's a 720 and if that's his garage. He's got a 675 LT in the background as well
*  That's where he bought it. Yeah, okay cool. Yeah, I know he's got that's that's the right car for sure
*  That's it's a spider too so the roof comes up 11 11 seconds while you're driving
*  11 seconds up and down can you go I think it's up to up to 40 or something you can go pretty you can be going
*  Pretty good right yeah, I put it up just while driving around and yeah
*  And I drove through the rain, and I learned that if you go 74 miles an hour you stay dry
*  Keep it over 74 with the top down your standard, so it just whistles past you right over your head
*  But whatever you stop at a red light, and you're fine. Oh, you're done. It's got happen on the highway
*  Sickest rooster tails this car makes
*  If you hammer down in the rain because it it spools up the water out the the like the diffuser
*  And it gets hit with the exhaust and it does like a top gun swirl no fucking
*  Video of this anyway, I don't know if I got video of it. You're not good video the sickest thing
*  Oh
*  Sometimes it's a missed opportunity. Oh god that sounds so crazy. It's so much money
*  $450,000 so much money for a car
*  I know there's so many of these custom cars that people are making now like like seeing it with that
*  1.8 million dollar the L.s. Yeah, yeah, you know about that. Yeah
*  Dynamic and light weighting study yeah, Chris Harris was on my show talking about it
*  I have a real problem with you calling a car study like I didn't call that anybody anybody doing that
*  Settle the fuck down. I'll tell you what if Elon called that truck a study. I might be a little less angry about it
*  It's so cool super cool
*  Yeah, so the death the DLS yeah point eight million dollar car that's not nearly as fast as that McLaren no
*  But it's got one of the gnarliest engines that money could buy at any price
*  Yeah, they have sound that engine in specifically in that is a four liter
*  To the co-developed by a guy named Hans Metzger who developed the engine in your GT3 RS
*  He's a legend the met the legendary Metzger engine. Yeah, which people talk about it Porsche
*  co-developed by Metzger and Williams the Formula One team Jamie pull up the video that's we can
*  The sound of this I think it revs to like 10 5 what yeah, it revs. It's because this is the first ever
*  Air cooled 9-eleven engine that has a four valve head
*  9,000 rpm yeah
*  I
*  Thought it reads to above 9, but it's it's ba nanas
*  Oh, this is Chris Harris driving up the hill at Goodwood. I believe
*  Exhaust carbon fiber dude this car is ba nanas pretty. I don't know who's driving it. That's
*  Rich to even consider this well, you know how they ended up doing this
*  They literally had a customer who came to them and said, you know half a million for the normal car
*  That's great and all but what if I give you a full-on blank check full blank check?
*  This is what they end up with playing some volume. Give me some turn this shit up
*  Bro see that's what you need in your life. Listen this flyby
*  Let me be honest with you that's $400,000 engine
*  It's not as cool as a shark works 9-eleven GT3 RS
*  It's not because the shark works is just fast. You could drive it anywhere. You park it anywhere. It handles probably better
*  Maybe I don't know sounds just as good bro. There's no rhyme or reason or math that leads you to buy
*  Cool things a weird world's without getting into that world's weird
*  Like if you had a 500 horsepower engine anywhere else that costs you 400 grand people would kill you
*  Yeah, you're cool. What are you talking about? Yeah beat you to death. Did we just charge me?
*  $400,000 for a fucking engine. I'll kill you. Yeah, did we talk about this on the last show?
*  Um, you know, we talked about this in text. Okay, we were talking about value. Yeah air-cooled horsepower
*  Yeah is like the worst value in motoring. Yeah, so if you want like
*  Let's say you're starting with an engine that works you buy a regular car like my Carrera is an 87
*  It's my pipe or started you're starting with an 87 Carrera
*  Okay
*  And and you go in and you have an engine that works and you go to a performance shop and you say this engine makes
*  About 200 horsepower as it is. I want it to make 300 horsepower
*  You have to give him your engine and probably
*  $50,000 or $60,000 if you want that engine to make 350 horsepower
*  You probably have to give him a hundred thousand dollars and if you want that engine to make 400 horsepower
*  You have to give him a quarter of a million dollars
*  That's what it costs to get that type of so when you see cars like a Singer where you go
*  Okay, here's a singer in 9-eleven and and it's 600 grand a quarter of a million dollars
*  Is that is the engine a singers got 50 grand and leather in it 50 grand in raw leather materials
*  Just some material just the materials. Yeah, this shit adds up like real fast
*  Well the interiors of those things are special they're really special really really special
*  But I mean, I guess like that's what that Rob guy wanted to do right like he's no object. Yeah
*  He's really into bespoke everything and their whole thing. Everything is important and there's a market for it, too
*  I mean John Ward with your Brock over there is maybe a half a bump down from that
*  Yeah, quite as obsessed but but on that same level. Oh, yeah. Yeah, those are cheap
*  No, the icon stuff is great and they've they've got great taste
*  I think it's he's got weird style what I love Jonathan Ward is his style like what he's into
*  Yeah, like I love that. He makes those derelicts
*  Yeah, and the way the guy talks taste is perfect. Oh, it's got amazing taste his ideas and design taste
*  But I just had a thought earlier you were kind of lamenting how these modern supercars aren't analog and they don't just that
*  Right there is where companies like Singer and icon come in. They will deliver you that analog
*  Not just an analog product. They'll deliver you the like in 1999
*  Porsche stopped making air-cooled engines
*  They started making water-cooled engines but like Singer and some other people are like well
*  What if you continued developing the air-cooled engine from where Porsche left off? And so that is how you end up with
*  You know half a million dollars
*  Because people that have this kind of money are willing to pay for that analog experience
*  But without any sacrifice at all or the 1.8 million dollars
*  I think they made I don't know how many 20 or 30 of those but that's 20 or 30
*  Oh, these fucking Saudis and these Chinese guys. It's not you're there's no either or there's no either or anymore
*  You know what I mean with these million dollar plus cars. It's all the same 300 people really
*  Yes, they all the average Bugatti owner has like 50 cars 50 not really in 5 or 10. Yeah
*  It's the same 300 people own has one just hoovering up shit so it's Tracy Morgan. I know
*  crashes on the first day first day
*  Tracy Morgan I I love I love seeing Tracy Morgan in a Bugatti that to me is just
*  Fucking spend that Walmart money fuckers spend all of it. How much did they give him from the crash?
*  I don't think anyone's ever said but it's I mean it was tens of millions of dollars if not hundreds of millions
*  It's a lot of money. It's whatever his lifetime earning potential was as Tracy fucking Morgan
*  He's barely that's a Bugatti Grand Sport Vitesse the the the roof comes off and he's
*  CRV just crutch just turned right in bro that CRVs insurance is
*  But that's the kind of car that's gonna hit you a minivan that doesn't give a fuck about life
*  I mean, that's you know
*  You can you can worry about that kind of shit or you can yesterday
*  You know I was I was in my in my off-road 9-eleven here
*  And there was a double right turn lane right and I was on the outside one someone's on the inside one and they're on
*  Their phone not fucking pay the engine we both make the turn and they they don't stay on theirs
*  They just drift into mine of course so I go into the dirt shoulder and fucking hammer down sideways out the dirt
*  Shoulder and pass them out of the dirt. That's why you want a 9-eleven
*  Yeah, I guess for those rare moments we'd driven off by an asshole in a minivan. Yeah, oh we took a left, but Tyke it
*  I can it's
*  It's like 700 horsepower
*  So I think it's I think they're calling it 610 horsepower and 750 torque
*  But just like the Tesla the torque is incident zero zero, so you saw the video. I sent you the fucking launch
*  Yeah, it's you know you were really splitting hairs here with the Tesla and the Porsche
*  What you know what does two four feel different from two five like I don't know my eyes hurt
*  Yeah, same shit, and the Porsche has this really interesting
*  thermal management system
*  So Tesla although they do a beautiful road car for the city you know they've never gone racing
*  They don't they don't know about endurance racing or real real high performance driving
*  I mean you've seen them kind of struggle with the Nurburgring a little bit
*  It's a little harder than it looks over there. What did happen with the Nurburgring with the Tesla?
*  I think they went over there with a prototype. They took the interior out of the ad prototype
*  Yeah, yeah, which means the wide body. It's a wide body version with three engines. I believe yeah
*  They wouldn't they weren't talking about what it was
*  But I think it's a three motor car with a widened body and a different aero package and different tires
*  There were some and they went back with one with a giant like GT3 wing on it, too
*  That's it seemed like they
*  The number they originally put out and you guys talked about on the show Jamie looked it up was a con a
*  compilation of best sector time
*  So they released this sort of theoretical best time
*  But they never actually ran that complete lap the big difference between a Tesla and the Porsche right now is thermal management
*  Managing heat and cool sort of where it needs to go. Yeah, there's the prototype
*  And I believe that Tesla can build they're the exactly the kind of company that can build
*  A one-off prototype they could go around the nerve-wracking very fast like yeah, they could do that. You could see how it's wider
*  It looks cool. It looks badass. It does look
*  Yeah, it's awesome. But the we didn't put out the apex. Show me a photo of the apex
*  So the Taiken has this really interesting thermal management system that integrates the brakes the battery the motors and the cabin heat
*  And he a cabin climate control all in one system
*  And so it's very common to see a lot of people that are like oh, yeah
*  All in one system
*  And so it's very common that one system will need heat while the other needs to be cooled and one will need
*  So they if the brakes are hot but and they need to be cooled
*  But the cabin is cold and needs to be hot
*  They use the brake heat to they can send heat or cold anywhere in the car. It needs to go
*  No, stay up there go back. That looks okay. It's not that bad
*  Oh, it doesn't let you change it. It changes. Oh, that's not bad. It's okay
*  I've seen worse swap everything out with carbon fiber, but they put dope wheels on it
*  But the the interior is where the magic I would like to see the interior that I don't really see
*  A point to doing body kits on evs, but I think the idea you go quilted leather little armrest some carbon
*  I think the idea is that go back up see the on the left there with the body at the the wheels are nice
*  Yeah, they put larger wheels wider tires. What does that say on it? Let's say unplugged on the brakes
*  Oh god, I think that's their company. Oh, oh it's called unplugged performance. Yeah apex unplugged apex s I mean
*  It's not for me. I think they put carbon fiber brakes on it
*  Are those carbon ceramic brakes? I think carbon ceramic brakes. I think they probably charge a lot of money for that
*  I'm sure it's not cheap. I don't know maybe the interior but I wouldn't carbon ceramic brakes. How about that? Yeah
*  Maybe they could do it 19 piece with porsche
*  Like so your tesla for instance if you want max performance like the hardest launch you can do
*  You got to have like 80 battery or more
*  And it'll only let you do a couple of them in a row before it starts to get noticeably slower
*  You know what I mean? It'll let you let you launch but you want that two five or whatever it is
*  It's only going to be your first couple launches where you get it, right?
*  The ticon will give you full performance until the battery is dead
*  Well, so I get a full bore launch control start with like 40 miles of range on the battery now
*  How many miles can it get from fully charged in theory?
*  300 in theory. Yeah, but that's me driving like an old lady
*  So I was able to drive around normally and I found that the range estimate was pretty accurate
*  I only got the car for one day
*  So it was pretty accurate and then I went to the canyons and in that video
*  I burned off 40 of the battery just making that video really yeah, it would be the same in a tesla
*  It's not it's when you start driving real fast in evs bro
*  You're just you're just smoking through battery
*  But do you think that with the demand technology will improve to the point where they can get like real range out of these things?
*  Like the theoretical range of the tesla roadster was like 600 miles, but again, that's never been done
*  I think
*  So i'm not an expert on evs and there's like electrical engineers that will be screaming fucking at their ipods right now
*  It's normal. I believe I know right I believe that the
*  300 mile range is a good that's a good amount of range
*  The key that we will see that will really be a game changer is battery charge times
*  How can we get a charge in five minutes or ten minutes and not 30 minutes or an hour?
*  Uh and the the number of stations the opportunity to charge and that's an issue with uh the porsche over the tesla
*  Is they don't have the super charging network, right? Correct?
*  Although they are using the electrify america network, which is actually it's another one of the networks
*  That's meant for like normal evs. It's actually bigger really but they don't have as many super high-speed chargers
*  So the tesla and all evs on the market right now except the taiken all the rest are 400 volt systems
*  Okay, and the tesla is probably the best most efficient use of 400 volt architecture
*  800 volt architecture if porsche is to be believed is more efficient the it's a lighter setup
*  It flows in and out faster than the 400 volt system
*  There's a couple other advantages to it, but it can charge really really fast
*  Through the correct chargers. There just aren't that many of the super fast ones around
*  There's only three in la right now
*  One is in burbank at the best buy in burbank is the closest one to here
*  And I charged one from almost dead to almost full in about 18 minutes. Wow at that one
*  Yeah, but they're just starting very many so so you can go stop grab a cup of coffee. Yeah, get a bike to go to best buy
*  Yeah, stroll around. Yeah, you come out you got 80 of your juice. Yeah, it was pretty good
*  It went fast enough that I could watch it go six
*  Seven really? Yeah. Yeah, it was pretty good
*  Like yeah, if they get the number of stations, right? I think the real problem with ev adoption, especially in place like la
*  Is the infrastructure man? I don't think this city
*  Generates enough electricity
*  Through its grid for all of us to be charging cars at home
*  Good point right because it would if we got all the millions of cars that are now charging it would radically change everything
*  Unless everybody switches over to solar
*  Even solar I don't think is efficient enough. That's the other problem is now
*  It's a homeowners thing and so like evs are awesome
*  like if you like how an ev drives and you like the experience of owning one and it works for your life like
*  1000 get an ev but
*  Is is a 90 ev adoption rate in la something that's really realistic like not anytime soon
*  I just don't think so. I'm building a building right now
*  And so I know i'm learning about how much power the city will give me in my building
*  And I don't have enough this i'm building a brand new building
*  And the city won't give me enough power to put more than two level two charges in my building
*  I was like yo, let me get a bank of five
*  My building would be an ev charging spot and they're like no can do bro. We won't no power
*  So really? Yeah, and can you enhance the amount of power that you have? Not really. I mean
*  solar
*  It like solar will reduce your bill, but it doesn't add it doesn't give you more
*  Amps in the building unless you're completely off grid, correct? And then you'd have to have and then you'd have some
*  Yeah, now we're now you're in the weeds. Yeah, now you're doing the opposite
*  You're like burning fucking dinosaur fuels trying to keep your shit going and I don't you know with a new building
*  I'm no expert but all the people who are experts are telling me that I should wait a year or two and see what my
*  Utilities are before I even attempt solar because I might you know, you put it in now
*  How do you know if you've saved any money? Right? Right. Yeah, i'm obligated by law to make my building solar ready
*  So I had to reinforce the roof. Yeah
*  Yeah, there's a bunch of shit when you're building a building that you got to do to in 2019
*  Yeah, my building is the only collector. This is our west side collector car storage my new business
*  It's open for reservations currently. Yes, we'll be open in january. We're a little bit behind but construction's hard as it turns out
*  um, it's the it's the first time that we've ever put
*  Indoor quad stackers in southern california. We have four high vehicle stackers. We have 18 of them
*  What are you doing about earthquakes the built the rubber everywhere 2019 code, dude
*  Yeah, dude. We have we have more concrete and rebar. I mean this we're up to it. We're good for a 12.0 earthquake
*  That's what we're rated at. That's the 2020 standard. I want a house like that. It's
*  Bro, we poured a house. I poured 110
*  Cement trucks that'd be great if the world's on fire and just sitting there sipping tea
*  Dude, well you want speaking of that?
*  so the wall the dividing wall in between the car storage area and the members lounge my office in my studio
*  Is legally required to be a two-hour firewall?
*  So you can sit there and have a tea and watch a fire on the other side for two hours and then just walk out
*  The front door really? Yeah, that's a law for for cal for la for 2019. Wow. We had to have the fire code written for us
*  It's sucked
*  That seems pretty cool though that they're doing that that they're making these standards extremely high
*  I believe that it's good to have high standards and that you can
*  Get it, you know you but you end up with a higher quality product and you can then charge more for it
*  You know and that's sort of how it works
*  But that's a big leap for you to just jump in and build some crazy car storage building
*  Yeah, i've never done shit like that before think about that like the amount of money that must cost is fucking extraordinary
*  I'll tell you off mike. Tell it. Yeah, it's it's
*  You can probably guess but it's crazy. It's crazy and it's scary and
*  It started small. Yeah, and then it and it was like well the the model doesn't work small
*  What about medium the model doesn't work medium either?
*  What about big well it only works big if you build the building, you know
*  Because you the the bland is so expensive that you have to go vertical
*  And you can't go vertical in an existing structure because it just doesn't meet earthquake codes
*  So you have no choice but to build and then
*  There's a law in la that if you build for every thousand square feet of commercial real estate you have you need to have two
*  Street accessible parking spaces. Oh, so I had to dig a basement. So I dug a 7 000 square foot basement
*  So I have 30 underground parking spaces that counts
*  So the half the cost of the building was digging the basement. Jesus christ, dude
*  Yeah, and where is this? It's in plyo vista. It's across the street from google and yahu and the clippers building
*  All those dirty rich people dirty dirty rich people dirty. Yes filthy rich. Yes. Wow, that's cool
*  You gotta come see it man. It's the coolest where's plyo vista. What is that near? It's right off the 405 in jefferson
*  Um on the way between marina del rey and lax. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  Perfect for people who live out of town hit me up westside collector car stores.com. That's the end of my plug
*  i'm done come visit but i'm learning so much about concrete and steel and
*  You know all this crazy shit concrete's a weird weird science, man
*  Oh, I'd imagine it's crazy the pressure testing and they have different mixtures and they shake all the rebar to get it to settle
*  It's fucking nice. Yeah, you gotta wait for the perfect day to do your porn. How long have you been building this? Four years four years
*  That's right. When we first started talking about it was at least two years ago
*  We broke ground two years ago. I broke ground in august of 17, dude
*  You must be shitting your pants with all that money. I'm so exhausted. I don't know how to handle that
*  I'm so exhausted friends that have built houses before i'm like fuck man
*  We remodeled our kitchen once for eight months. We were cooking on a hot plate in the living room
*  And I was like, this is ridiculous. Yeah, it's
*  It's like, you know, it's like a project car, you know, we're at the point where the car looks done
*  It basically looks done
*  Except there's just so much left to do and dealing with the city is so so hard. This is why I'm
*  I'm a little less optimistic about others in terms of the adoption rates of
*  evs and stuff like that and and solar and stuff like that because it's
*  Working with the city for this stuff is so hard and it's taken me so long to do one stupid fucking building that like
*  We're looking at a whole city. Like I don't know how anything got built here
*  Crazy, do you think about moving?
*  Man sunshine's free and weed's legal. So nice. Good point. I know that's corny as fuck, but
*  Makes me want to spark up a joint. Let's do it. It goes a long way. Yo, what's what about that? Kevin smith shit
*  Kevin smith was up in here talking about his snoochie boochies, bro. It's just weed
*  I know it is kevin smith's a great guy
*  I know it is but I but I had the thought when I was listening to your show and it was like
*  You're telling me the fictional drug dealer from that movie. I loved when I was 13
*  Is now a real drug dealer but legally and as that movie character. That is some crazy ass shit
*  Yeah, that's basically what's going on. What is this? Tyson weed? This is mike tyson weed. Yeah, how about that?
*  Do I go get a face tattoo afterwards is that what you don't have to
*  But if you smoke the whole thing, you probably want one. Wow. Do you sell this like this? Yeah, it's a full godfather blunt. Yeah
*  Giant fat blunt that looks like that is crazy. That is awesome. All right, it's pretty fucking good, dude
*  What do we need to talk about with cars? Is there anything else happening in the industry that you want to know about?
*  Well, I mean the tycan I don't think we've like completely covered it
*  No, my question with all these cars is what is next, right?
*  It's like right we're seeing these incredible zero to sixty under three second times
*  Yeah, we're going to eventually see the range increase
*  But if you had asked me 10 years ago
*  Are we going to see a 2.4?
*  Zero to sixty sedan that feels like it's violating physics when you stomp on the gas
*  I mean, that's where I drive and have a laptop for a screen
*  Yeah, we've you know, we've gotten to about I don't know right right maybe 10 years ago or so
*  The the the trajectory of increased performance got very steep
*  Yeah, where you know the new version of every car has a hundred more horsepower
*  And now we've got these high performance evs and with a high performance ev
*  You know, you're you've built a dragster that that's a fucking dragster
*  I mean the the the tycan does your does a quarter mile on the low tens
*  I mean
*  So you can you know
*  I don't want to be flippant and say all it takes is money
*  But all it takes is money you walk into a dealer and you're buying a dragster that you know
*  You you're sitting in an arch nhra license to run that fast now. You could do it on the way to whole foods
*  That's crazy, you know, and so with tycan the real difference for me
*  Between tycan and tesla is the steering and handling because teslas have very video gamey steering
*  It's accurate and it's sharp, but it's not I don't feel it
*  No
*  This the tycan has the steering system from the Porsche 992 and so it feels like a Porsche
*  And so when I drove it, I texted you I go joe
*  This is for you
*  Well tesla figured out how to make it go fast and they figured out how to make it handle pretty how to make it cool
*  Yeah, they figured how to make an ev cool because evs remember the rav4 ev fucking ed bagley was driving in the 90s
*  Like what is this jamie?
*  One of the things that makes Porsche tycan different is they have a two-speed transmission your tesla is one gear
*  So your tesla from zero to 120?
*  Is bananas, but it pretty much dies off because it runs out of gear
*  Because most people don't really need to go faster than that, but porsche with their autobahn stuff
*  They need more at the top end
*  So the tycan actually switches into second gear and keeps pulling like crazy
*  You know above 80 to 100 miles an hour and the biggest difference though dynamically
*  Is like, you know how in your tesla you can drive with one foot like one pedal when you lift off the pedal
*  It breaks the car. Yeah, and so you can pretty much drive around one foot
*  Tycan doesn't do that. So porsche believes that the kinetic energy built up by
*  Motion is better used by allowing the car to just coast
*  As far as possible then by hitting the regen and capturing it in the form of
*  Breaking the way that tesla does now you can turn that function off in the tesla
*  Does that have an impact on?
*  Um, well if it's doing that does it does it have an impact on the way it feels?
*  Well, it feels
*  I mean yes, because you have to use the brakes more in everyday situations
*  The car quicker to use the brakes more to do I mean to have regenerative the way no it doesn't necessarily slow the car down faster
*  It just means that you do zero time. No, in fact if I believe that porsche is ultimately better at that
*  It's the only real difference is that when you lift off the gas in a tesla
*  It slows down as if someone is applying the brakes. Yeah in the porsche
*  You just pure coast. It's a pure coast and it and it's a really
*  It's it's an even more of a coast that feeling than a gasoline car. It's like you're freed of all
*  Restraint like because after i'm fucking mobbed up the mountain making that video that I sent you
*  Yeah, I was like, oh shit, dude. I've only got like 40 miles of range left. I gotta get off this fucking hill
*  Yeah, and so I I was at the high point in the hill and I go let's coast and so I just
*  Coasted and I was like, let's see how far I can go without touching the brakes
*  And I got this motherfucker coasting up to like 100 miles an hour
*  Taking corners and not using the brakes because the handling and the grip were so good
*  I coasted like 12 miles down the hill, dude. What about a deer? What about a boing boing boing?
*  Alertness boom about that alertness
*  I've seen some crazy shit while i'm filming and i've never been able to not stop the car
*  No, I believe me. I know you can drive. I saw the guys pulling a log down the road just on free on a chain
*  Oh my god, there was a guy in a ford explorer driving in a windy canyon like this
*  Make a video of this
*  Yeah
*  I caught it on camera and with a log like the size of like a car engine just free on a chain swinging swinging
*  Taking out signs jesus christ craziness
*  Sometimes I almost threw that video in the garbage too. It's amazing how little of that there really is
*  Oh, yeah here it is. So god damn crazy. I think it right there back it up 20 seconds Jamie 20 more
*  Yeah, so come around this corner. Look
*  Logs got a lot
*  Just free dragging that shit is so crazy that he thinks that's okay
*  And if you back the video up like 30 more seconds, Jamie, you can actually see
*  Uh not from the very beginning a little forward you can see see the the trail that the log has made on the road
*  It's it made like a like a line of kind of dirt
*  Uh on the road and it goes back and forth across the road and you go. Well, what the hell was that dude?
*  That's so crazy, you know, what's really crazy about that that could start a fire. Oh my god, that's
*  Probably but it could also swing into an oncoming car. That's like a 500 pound log
*  Yeah, it definitely could swing into an oncoming car. That guy definitely doesn't have control. It's definitely a terrible terrible idea
*  But I managed to stop a supercharged
*  Uh lamborghini doing that that's by the way, that's not my youtube video. Someone has stolen my youtube video motherfuckers. Yeah
*  Motherfuckers these motherfuckers. No hit that fraud protection, Jamie
*  That's incredible. That's a crazy thing to see
*  Yeah, there's knuckleheads out there man. There's a lot of them. I go quick
*  But I go up there at times that I I know almost almost for certain that the road is empty
*  I that the the the roads that I use are not commuter roads and I go there at times where there's it's
*  Highly unlikely to see people. That's the same amount of time in the day where that guy drags logs
*  It's like that's the same spot. Excellent point, sir. Same spot on the top. Hey when I drag my logs
*  No one's on that fucking mountain. God damn it. What are you doing up there speeding?
*  Yeah, that's true. That's good points his logs man points. You're heavy to pick up. I've seen other weird shit
*  I've seen people doing push-ups in the street. Oh, I've seen
*  Christ I've seen people on run horseback in the street dude. Some guy just died who is a world-class climber
*  Do you hear that what I felt he fell a thousand feet? Oh
*  Not the not the uh, not alex honnold. No, did you meet that? Did you interview him? I've had him on twice
*  He's fascinating that movie is crazy
*  Dude, he's on another level. He's like a zen master
*  Yeah, because he kind of he he has that like smoke show of a girlfriend
*  He pretty much tells like oh, you know you just do your thing i'm gonna be on this wall dude
*  He freaks me out
*  I mean freaks me out to the point where like talking about him my hands start sweating I get super nervous
*  Oh, I got I got real sweaty watching that movie freaked out thinking about him
*  What he does is like off the charts nuts, man
*  He's he's a thousand feet in the air and he's just no hand. I mean no ropes
*  Holding on with one hand straight t-shirt fuck man. I can't that
*  Thumb thing in that movie. What's the name of the fucking movie?
*  Free solo. Thank you when he goes you had to put your thumb and it's like on this postage stamp side
*  Yeah, and that's how he's staying alive. Fuck this. That's correct. I don't have to stay calm
*  Do you I don't have that thing?
*  I got none of that can't it's I can't do that shit. No, i'm not interested
*  I'm amazed that he can and i'm fascinated to watch him. It's like I just don't want to never get hurt
*  He's a really nice guy
*  I mean he's you feel like he just needs to be on that edge, right?
*  Some of those people just they need that my hands are sweaty talking. I know me too me too. Fuck or maybe that's uh,
*  Maybe that's uh, mike tyson's weed. It's like tyson's weed
*  Could be yeah, you combine tyson's weed in that
*  That picture what about the guy taking that picture put that down. I get it down jimmy
*  Fuckin hell
*  I'm too high to look at that. Tell me how you like your grand seiko watches
*  They're very nice the last time I came on the show
*  I talked to you about my grand seiko watch and your show is so good for business that I got a handwritten letter from
*  the CEO of grand seiko wow
*  That's very nice. They make beautiful stuff. They do
*  I love uh mechanical shit
*  Yeah
*  You know
*  I love things where someone's making it and there's gears and there's innovation and i'm just fat
*  I don't know what what part of our monkey brain is so fascinated by innovation and craftsmanship and shit like that
*  What's cool to me about watches is like they're these crazy math machines
*  In and I had a watch called an iwc perpetual calendar
*  Uh that was like it's like it was like a big fucking tank of a watch and it would do
*  time
*  the day date the month the year four digits year, uh, the the
*  moon phase
*  And it had a powers and it basically would it knew all the leap years it knew how many days that's it
*  How many days there are in a month and you if you kept this fucking thing wound?
*  And on either wearing it or on a winder you didn't have to adjust it for 400 years
*  Like you don't have to adjust it until the year
*  2400
*  That's fucking crazy
*  That's just springs and wheels dude
*  Isn't that nuts
*  That really is nuts and when you put it that way, it's it's astonishing because it's it's an interesting combination of engineering and art
*  Yeah, right and there's really pretty yeah, but it also it's it's
*  Phenomenal engineering like who are the wizards behind that? There's a new there's a watch called a vacheron constantine
*  They that is it's it looks like a clock. It's like as big as this clock
*  It has the most complications of any watch ever made has 57 complications
*  So one mainspring
*  drives
*  57 different spring and gear sets
*  That do 57 different things and that will and it will continue like that
*  That's some funky weird-ass art piece. I don't know what that is
*  I don't know what that is. That's some weird shit
*  Um, but uh, yeah, that's bonkers. I know but I don't even someone's doing that
*  That's what they're doing and making it and here's a really bonkers thing when you find out that they started making them in like
*  The 40s and like what oh you mean a guy who's worked on one watch for like a decade
*  No, but like if you think about like automatic watches like uh, like rolex or something like that
*  When did they start making those? Well mechanical watches they've been making since like the 1700s
*  If you want to talk about strictly like the automatic winding rotor
*  Just jamey. It's uh vacheron constantine
*  Rotation is when was the first automatic winding watch it was like in the early, uh, like probably world war two
*  Uh time. Yeah. Yeah the winding rotor maybe a little early maybe like the 20s
*  It might have actually so that so what you're looking at that's one side
*  There's there's there's shit on both sides of that thing. What isn't that crazy? What is all that nonsense?
*  It's so much shit. I don't even know. I honestly don't even know. I can't read that
*  I don't know and there's a list there's a wikipedia page for that watch that has the list of all the complications
*  but but something like that you're literally talking like it's probably
*  Six or seven million dollars to buy something like that
*  Some someone just paid 30 30 million dollars for a watch. What? Yeah, the most I think it was might have been the most expensive
*  It was a paddock. It's a weird thing right because it is the
*  Gentleman's jewelry, right? Yeah, it's the gentleman's jewelry where it's like literally like 90% for other guys
*  It's like yeah, look at those. Yeah, and it's a specifics. Look at that movement though. Yeah specific subset of other guys
*  Yeah, and it's it's um
*  You know, we don't get to like we don't we don't really get to wear diamonds and shit around, you know
*  But we got to have a trophy so it's okay. Check this out. You'll like this. My friend Cameron Weiss made this
*  This is a Weiss watch company watch designed and manufactured
*  exclusively in Los Angeles every bit of that watch made in Los Angeles. Wow, he got me that for uh,
*  When I first met him and um, he makes them by hand every one of them very pretty super murka
*  I like that shit. Oh fuck you
*  Oh my god, can I tell you yes that I just saw there is a fast and the furious musical parody
*  That these dudes came up with
*  and they're doing it in this little theater here the dynasty typewriter theater and it is
*  like
*  the team america of fast and the furious and it's the fucking funniest thing i've ever seen I went twice whoa and
*  It's gone. It's just called the fast and the furious musical parody
*  But it's they have like women play a bunch like tyrese
*  And like ludicrous are played by women it's fucking great
*  Uh, it was written by these guys brad, uh sill nutzer and uh, joey orton. They came my podcast
*  And this is one of the funniest things i've ever seen
*  And I don't know you got on me on a team america tangent dude. I went there. What a great idea. It's fucking hilarious, dude
*  It's so great
*  Anyway, are you still alive your second show of the day? Yeah, i'm fine
*  Fine
*  The solution is either less drugs or more drugs. Um, well marijuana takes everything into that weird hard left
*  You know, so it's like no matter what you were doing during your day before you smoked weed now
*  You're doing once you smoke weed. You're like, whoa, what are we doing?
*  Should we talk about like some conspiracy theories something fc didn't kill himself. I don't think he did. Nope
*  I think he might not have maybe maybe this what are the odds that he did?
*  If you had a bet if I was in vegas I wanted to give you odds like hey the odds he did
*  Come on matt 10 10 10 10 is where i've where i've got it
*  I don't I don't want to say it's like zero, but I think it's like 10. I think it's low
*  So would you plunk down 100 bucks on 10 to 1 odds that that he did kill himself?
*  No
*  I would yeah probably yeah, you'd want 10 you'd want more than 10 to 1 that he did kill himself
*  No, no, I think there's only a 10 chance. He killed himself. Right? Okay. I'm fucking with these numbers here
*  I'm making it. I don't know how you're however you're converting it to odds. It's falling apart. I get it. Sorry. I get it
*  It doesn't seem to go with no way though. It doesn't seem likely no
*  Um, it's crazy that you could still do that
*  Did you see the ford electric car? Absolutely suicide guards say they're scapegoats
*  For a broken system. Well, that's a defense. The defense is just we were incompetent not
*  We killed him
*  Dude, who knows?
*  That's there is some fucking weird shit going on in our country right now in the scenes, man
*  What's going on behind the scenes that somebody could sneak somebody in to kill somebody if that's what happened?
*  What's going on? Oh, that's that's an inside person. They don't they don't just sneak somebody in that person's audience
*  The cameras are off bro. That's crazy. Fuck the cameras were the cameras were off. Whoops. Sorry. Yeah the cameras come on
*  Whoo?
*  Bro, I have cameras at my house. They're never fucking off. Come on when the cameras are off, too. I've heard
*  Repeated a few times but not more recently that there uh, there was screaming
*  Being heard from his cell that someone heard screaming. Yeah
*  That's not stopping repeated now, so
*  dude
*  Bro, we live in a fucking crazy world. Yeah, that's dark. Um, I don't know
*  Hi, you're right
*  It's just that's probably the biggest
*  Public conspiracy theory that most people believe in
*  Do you think most people believe it was it was a hit? I would say most people
*  I just read about one last night. Is there a poll? Is there a pew poll on that one?
*  They tried to overthrow FDR in 1935 and this general
*  Was like the whistleblower for it because the people that were supposedly trying to do it
*  We're trying to get him to be like the face to talk people into doing it
*  And so he went and talked to congress about it. His name's like smedley
*  butler, I think smedley butler what is a double medal honor winner and
*  They called him out and everyone said oh, no, that's just a lie. It was a joke
*  There might have been some stuff being talked about in this meeting
*  But we were never going to do anything and they said they had 500 000 soldiers that were going to march on dc
*  To take over and they had some general they're going to put in place as a dictator there's a book written about a couple years ago
*  And this guy smedley butler wrote a book in 1935 called like war is a racket. Yeah
*  Wow, wow, so he knew about all that. Yeah. Yeah, I just read about this last night. Geez
*  How do you know it was the source? Uh the book that that's called i'll pull it up. It's um
*  Like the time
*  The conspiracy to overthrow the government and then it's all it's all about him
*  It's a really long book that just came out about like overthrowing FDR
*  Wow
*  Interesting, I guess none of this shit is like new
*  I feel like I haven't been i'm like I just turned 38 and I feel like I didn't really start
*  Paying attention to anything until you know, I was in like my mid-20s or whatever. Yeah, and it's been
*  You know, yeah bush was a piece of shit and then it kind of seemed on the surface like obama was kind of normal
*  but like
*  It and now obviously we live in crazy town
*  But but it um
*  I think it I think I feel like it's new and it's not new and this kind of shit has just happened over and over and over
*  Again, well, it's the remnants of an ancient society
*  I mean we're dealing with this ancient system that was created long before we had anything
*  Resembling our way of communicating that we have now
*  It's all set up. You know, like when you have
*  a government like ours
*  It's set up in this way. It's like is this the ideal way to do it or is it just the way we've been doing it forever?
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, I don't think I don't think our
*  Bureaucracy can move fast enough to keep up with the technology. I think you're 100% right
*  I don't think culture some real problems. I don't think culture can keep up
*  I don't think I'm designed to handle the kind of communication that I
*  Feel like I have to handle in terms of like I have an instagram page with like
*  225 000 people and it's a lot less than you but I think you do a better job of like detaching from it than I do
*  Yeah, maybe you just keep yourself busier than I do
*  Even busy is important. It is but it's I just feel like i'm not designed to handle
*  Interpersonal communication with that volume of people. Yeah, who just feel that they can say what the fuck ever
*  You know and they're trying to push your buttons. Yeah, fuck with you. Yeah, that's kind of frustrating
*  We're all learning to communicate with each other like this and we're all learning to you know
*  Interact in real time with this new technology that no one saw coming
*  You know this new ability to communicate that just didn't exist before. Yeah, it's weird for all of us
*  It's weird for the dummies like me and it's weird for the really smart people that create all this technology
*  Yeah, we're opening up this new realm of human communication
*  I think by just by making every by you know by breaking it into
*  Tweets, you know, it's got to be these short little thoughts and all that angry man
*  Yeah, but just in terms of like if you watch um
*  Like uh look at our access to the news
*  Like our access to like these stories that are going on in hong kong
*  You could like specifically focus on and try to follow it and you can follow it pretty much all day long
*  All these protests and stuff like that. It's like it doesn't matter
*  If the networks are sanctioning it people are paying attention to things like that
*  Yeah, when things like that happen, they become these worldwide things that everybody is following along with that was never the case before man
*  You had to wait for the news. You had to wait for them to tell you what's going on in germany. That's true
*  Yeah, yeah, no, I think so weird now
*  so do you think that
*  That we actually live in what is probably generally a much better place
*  We just hear so much more bad shit that we think it's worse
*  Well, I think we're just aware of way more information than we're supposed to be aware of just overloaded all the time
*  And I think that's one of the reasons why so many people are anxious
*  I think just our sheer numbers are wearing on like the way we feel I I actually have
*  Developed like real anxiety just about fucking life, which I think it's directly related
*  Probably to like my internet consumption. You know what I mean? Oh for sure. Um, I think it's huge like social media of doing that
*  Of accentuating your interests, you know, this is the reason why so many people get in fights on facebook
*  Oh, yeah, because when you because it amplifies the angry the more you get upset at things the more you interact
*  So because of that they send you things that make you upset but isn't it that that's what you gravitate towards
*  So ari shafir actually did a test. Yeah, he did with puppies or something
*  And he just got all puppies. Yeah, he just started searching puppies and guess what how long did it take for him to get all puppies?
*  It wasn't that long. It was pretty quick. So it's not that it's malicious on its own. It's that we are
*  Cunts. Yeah, we're cunts
*  Yeah, it just it's like it's like a mushroom trip, right where it just if you feel good it spirals up
*  And if you feel bad it spirals down. It just it's the same kind of thing and
*  It's so it's but we can manage it. I think we can manage it
*  I think we just have to be nicer to each other. I really do. I think people can manage it
*  It's so easy to be nice in person, but it's so hard to be nice to some fucking
*  You know to someone who opens with what a piece of shit you are and is like, you know
*  It's a piss poor way of communicating. It's terrible
*  It's not you can get great stuff from it
*  But it also opens up the door to great cuntiness like the greatest cuntiness because it's like free shots of people
*  And it's just weird to do it's like weird to just someone you don't even know just insult
*  Right, but but they can do that to you and they feel free to do that to you
*  And they don't think of you as another person they think of you as some person who's in some public position. So it's
*  It's a free shot. Yeah on you and they think you should have thicker skin. They think this
*  They don't realize that you get into a job like this because you're insecure
*  But it's also listen
*  Nobody saw this coming like we should all be nice. Yeah about there are this new level of communication that we all have
*  You know
*  You can see things on your phone that are coming to you from the air and they're streaming in real time
*  I can't imagine what it's like to be a child who can grow up with the amount of porn that oh my god like
*  I don't want to go into this kind of a tangent too far, but like jesus christ
*  What is go like, you know when I was a kid you had to work for it, right?
*  You had there's always someone's stepdad who had a big collection or I had to do floppies
*  I mean I was I was on some I was on the the hard the hard floppy disks, you know
*  Yeah, that's that was that was the 90s kid 90s. It was still a challenge now
*  Way too easy. It's weird, right? Yeah, like
*  There's there's definitely
*  There's definitely a concern
*  There's a there's a there's also it's not just a concern that you have access to porn
*  How about the fact that porn is completely shaped the way people do their pubic hair?
*  Porn one does porn do you think right horn reflects society or society reflects porn?
*  I don't know, but if there was a let go a culture contest to see how you you trim your pubes
*  Porn completely went out definitely
*  Right, you can't be a girl and just be chaos anymore. Right? Can you do that? Is that a is that a move you can
*  It's a specific finish for that. You have to use key. Yeah, ari chafir is gonna have to use different keywords to get to that
*  Find ari they'll find them. What's what really weirds me out about porn is they've really transitioned to an all
*  Step siblings kind of when did that happen? I don't know what happened fucking this is gross
*  I said, when did everything get dirty? Everything is this the result of divorce culture?
*  It's something it's something all the divorce the kids of divorces have grown up to watch step brother porn and whatever step brother
*  And step sister is giant right now. This is fucking gross. It's 90 percent of titles. It's so weird
*  You're supposed to be my sister
*  I can't believe this like what the fuck are we watching?
*  Oh, is there a more depressing job than writing that dialogue? But why do people here's here's a question
*  Why do people want to be so naughty?
*  Like what is it because that's naughty. Well, that's not new people wanting to be naughty
*  That's not not new. No, but why do they always want to push it?
*  You know people keep wishing it they want people gagging and choking and that's that's that's that risk shit, dude
*  It's the risk becomes the thing
*  A friend of mine is like in the music business and like, you know, it was like a recovering, you know
*  super junkie and had a had a theory that a lot of the uh,
*  celebrities who have died of autoerotic asphyxiation
*  Um were former heroin users and once they get sober
*  The only way to get close is by jacking off with a fucking belt around your neck. Hey
*  Hey
*  and that uh
*  That seems to be a common thread in that maybe those deaths weren't exactly suicides. So there's there's maybe a conspiracy theory there
*  Well, if you were going to kill somebody that would be a good way to do it
*  Well, I don't think they were murdered. I think they were suicide. They were labeled as suicides if we're talking about like chris cornell
*  and anthony bourdain and
*  You know, it's a theory I guess
*  I mean, I don't think that was the case of bourdain
*  But it's seen the the the argument is that people who have had the high of heroin
*  The only way they can get close to that without drugs is by doing that. That's a crazy suggestion
*  It is a crazy suggestion. I don't think that's the case, but maybe I don't know. I don't know
*  I don't think
*  Maybe epstein was trying to jerk off. I don't know. Oh jesus christ
*  Jamie's like oh i'm letting it go. I'm not even not even jumping in open up a hole in it. Yeah
*  Uh, I don't know how we got down the porn tangent. It's probably my fault but
*  What else you got buddy ending your ride's a weird weird idea, you know deciding to end your ride
*  Yeah, it's probably something where people like feel like they don't have control over their life and they want to take it maybe
*  No, man, some I think some people just feel bad
*  They're just sad all the time and you just wanted to stop
*  It just makes sense that if if some people like are frail
*  In certain ways, we just accept that
*  But if they're frail in their happiness, we don't you know, like if someone's born with some sort of um
*  A disease and this disease affects them. We feel bad for them. Oh shit
*  but if we're born
*  Is this a man like if you're born sad, yeah, does it make sense?
*  I mean that you could be born with like a shitty level of dopamine
*  Your brain's not producing enough serotonin like something's the wiring is not totally on
*  Yeah, i've known my my share of depressed and or bipolar and or
*  Borderline people it's scary and sad
*  It is but we we have a we weird aversion. It goes back to our like primate days, you know, we want to like
*  Like
*  I want to get those people away from us
*  I have a weird I had a weird thing for a long time where I wanted to fix them
*  I was a real fixer for a while and it's not a healthy place to be in. That's a bad spot. Yeah
*  No, you and it's at that there's a
*  If you want to be fix up guy that comes from a whole list of your own fucking issues. Trust me. No, no
*  Yeah, don't do that. No, I got married to a the most amazing woman ever. I'm very lucky hannah rules
*  Thank you social it was my birthday the other day, uh, like two nights ago
*  She got me benny hannah lessons
*  At benny hannah and then I went back later that day and I cooked at benny hannah for like all my friends
*  It was like life goals achieved so they let you cook there
*  Yeah, they teach you how to cook and then they let you cook. Holy shit onion volcano the whole shit. No, dude

*  And she thought I was gonna light my face on fire and she was right. I almost did. Oh, that's hilarious
*  Yeah, fucking onion volcanoes dude, it's a great boomerang right there. I know it's one of the rare truly great boomerangs
*  I think like one of the top comments on that post is this is the only good boomerang in the history
*  Look at this lighter the lighter fails. So I almost light my face on fire when I get it to work. Yeah. No look
*  son
*  You almost lost some eyelashes. Oh fuck that
*  But yo, it's a really good birthday present. My wife rules
*  She got me axe throwing lessons one year. She got me a blacksmithing lessons one year
*  She likes to get me fun lessons for things. Who's the expert out there throwing axes? Is there one dude?
*  Fuck what's the guy's name? Michael Jordan of axe? Yes. No, there is. Oh shit. Oh, they're gonna kill me for
*  He has a hilarious name and a dvd series and shit. Oh really? Yeah
*  It's I want to say it's like lester diamond, but that's the guy from casino
*  It's something like that if you google knife throwing lessons la you might come up with it, but he but that's yeah
*  Now they have like they've opened like knife and axe throwing bars now
*  Really? This was two years ago, but now you can like go
*  Like it's like a bowling alley, but you throw axes. Oh my god
*  Ranked axe throwers in the world. I don't want to be around a lot of dudes who want to throw axes
*  You know you go to the axe throwing spot. That's like some viking shit. It's just darts right?
*  With axes. Yeah, yo, there's a hilarious video from yesterday of uh,
*  Pee pee mooded edge on the campaign trail trying to do an axe throw but like outdoor and he straight
*  overthrows the axe misses the target entirely and hits the dude's drum in the marching band. Oh my god
*  Imagine if you brain somebody like a stephen king book first, uh, did you imagine first presidential candidate to murder somebody with an axe?
*  Hit the dude in the head with an axe and the dude just
*  Just stiffened. Yeah, if trump did it his supporters would probably like him more he could
*  Really test that shoot somebody on fifth avenue theory
*  I've been on the video of the axe missing and hitting the guy's drum is crazy fucking funny
*  i've been on this audio book native american kick, uh, I
*  Listened to two different ones and the one i'm listening to now
*  Is uh like history?
*  son of the morning star
*  And uh my friend steve renella recommended it to me
*  Holy shit, dude
*  Just like I get nervous when I watch alex connell. Oh, yeah. Look wait. Here's that
*  It's not no, oh i'm sorry, I apologize
*  I apologize mayor pete. Oh shit fox news goes pete eskett. I apologize pete buddha judge my bad
*  But a fox news host threw a fucking axe and hit somebody. Oh my god, yo go with the
*  Man
*  Oh my god, oh my god
*  So bad
*  Why first of all why the fuck is there a band playing behind the spot with a guy throws an axe?
*  Whose idea was that?
*  Oh, dude, watch watch look at it. Here's the other angle. Oh my god. It goes in the drum
*  Dude, it could have killed him hit his arm. Oh my god. It could have killed him. Oh damn
*  I'm sorry pete buddha judge. That was pete eskett. Oh, sorry
*  The different pete but that's fucking horrible
*  You do some famous pete
*  I i'm sorry. I watched on my phone this morning. So it's a fox news guy imagine
*  It was just a just a news guy who killed somebody accidentally with an axe and not a presidential candidate
*  Just a news guy poor guy. He's just trying he just sucks at throwing an axe bro
*  Who set this up put a band behind the fucking target?
*  How trusting are you how many practice shots you think he took none zero?
*  New york, too, like how many people get to throw an axe in downtown new york, manhattan
*  You chill with a guy with an axe in new york. You think the dp was like, uh, can you bring the band around?
*  They're not in the shot. Let's get that band
*  fuck man
*  Jesus christ
*  That's fucking bad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry mayor pete. I thought it was you this the reason why I brought this up is this book is
*  horrific
*  It's all these accounts of what happened between
*  Uh the settlers and the native americans. Oh, oh my god. It wasn't good
*  I listened to that podcast the dollop, uh, which is like a history podcast
*  Fucking the people in this that came to this country were so horrible to the people that were here. It's so depressing
*  Yes. Yeah for sure
*  It was horrible with disease. It was horrible with just the amount of people that just came across the land
*  They killed all the buffalo they they wiped literally every native american tribe out of power and they put them on reservations
*  And violated the reservation was kansas, right? It just kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller dude. There's a lot to it
*  There's a lot to it. It's amazing the stories like the stories of the different tribes are just amazing
*  That just the differences between the ones who lived in the east versus like the comanches who were mostly just traveling and
*  Living in tepees and following the buffalo the ones in the eastern were like permanently settled in kind of one place, right?
*  Yeah, a lot of them, you know were into agriculture. They were growing they didn't even really have use for horses
*  They weren't into horses didn't white people steal their farming techniques, too
*  Probably for sure white people stole everything i'm reading a book called. I think it's called the history of the greater united states
*  It's by I think that's correct
*  But it's about
*  all of like the u.s
*  territories that are like outside of the continental united states and just like
*  Ways we fucked over native people and we you know, they're part of america, but they're not states
*  So they don't have to they don't get to vote
*  They don't get to do anything just like we've used these islands and and countries and stuff strategically all over the world
*  And uh, it's a slog through it, but it's it's kind of the kind of stuff. You kind of gotta read, right?
*  Well, you gotta you should probably know yeah, what what are we doing? We're doing what I feel like I
*  I went to a very good schools
*  I went to like a good college and a good high school and like I did not
*  Learn a lot of really important things. I learned a very winner-take-all version of history that i'm not pleased about
*  I missed out on everything. I wasn't paying attention to shit until I was like 28
*  Yeah, but now you are now you have now you pay attention to everything
*  Yeah, but before then I mean all throughout high school
*  The time that I did spend going to college was only so that no one would think I was a loser
*  I was I was just was it that binary if you're not in college?
*  You're a loser and if you're in college, you're not a loser
*  It was a huge insecurity with me because I knew I didn't want to do it and I knew like
*  Whatever that led to like I don't I didn't I just I i'm not interested
*  I don't have the discipline to sit in class and listen. I was too spastic
*  I wasn't interested in so crazy that you can't sit in class and listen and yet you can do the double header three hour podcast
*  That's not hard. We're talking about cool shit. You're a cool guy. You're fun to talk to I it's not hard
*  It's it's the way the material is delivered, huh? And the last one was you know what you'll see
*  But it's way more these two guys talking than me. Oh, I mostly moderated and mostly wound up agreeing
*  With the guy who made the game changers documentary
*  Mostly with what he was saying in terms of science
*  In terms of whether or not it's healthy to eat a hundred percent vegan diet according to everything he's showing me it is
*  Yeah, according to everything he was showing me and he had as much science as you could
*  You know, it's just a matter of doing it properly after i've been kevin smith on your show
*  I've i've considered trying to do like a vegan month or a vegan week or something
*  I haven't gone through with it yet, but i'm probably gonna I think it's different for different people too
*  I really do. I think some people have real issues with it
*  You know some people have gotten off the vegan diet and they've uh, they've quit and they were like a little less meat
*  Really? Well, I mean it's really I think it's different for everybody too, man
*  I think some people could do it with no problems and I think other people struggle more and I don't know why i'm not
*  A nutritionist, but I know that a lot of people that wind up trying it out eventually give up
*  It's like 84 percent. I know a couple of star vegans. Yeah
*  But I don't I don't have like a moral judgment for it or anything
*  I just feel like maybe it's something worth trying because I eat a lot of meat
*  Yeah, and i'm trying to get I have you know, I wrote a business plan for my new place
*  as you do when you have a new business and the first thing on the business plan is
*  By my 40th birthday. I want to be the healthiest i've ever been. Well, I don't think cutting meat out is the move
*  See, this is what I think about all this like I think you could definitely be healthy and be a vegan according to everything
*  This guy was showing me everything james wilkes was showing me. I don't really want to be a vegan. I like me
*  I have no moral qualms within I like how it tastes
*  I don't know if you're vegan, but I thought maybe if I did a little bit I could at least try
*  It makes a difference
*  No, I think the real thing to do is omnivorous diets
*  and I think this is one of the things that we proved today in this conversation between chris krecher and
*  James wilkes is that the um omnivorous diet is like a
*  Natural healthy thing you can do a vegan diet though. You can do it right according to everything he was showing me today
*  And I believe this too
*  If you're just doing it correctly if you monitor your nutrient levels you take you know vitamin b12 supplement
*  Which is something he advocates. I was like that makes sense to me
*  But I don't believe it means bad for you. I think that sedentary lifestyle
*  Shitty foods. Yeah, you've been eating meat since the beginning of time. Yeah
*  This is how we became people and literally one of the primary um theories for why the human brain got so big so quick
*  We had more access to protein because we were cooking things with fire
*  And we we learned how to hunt better because we our brains kept growing as we're just figuring out the throwing arm
*  They think is a possible factor like somehow or another the ability to throw something at something and kill it like made us much more productive
*  From farther away. That's a good that's key. Yeah, bro. We're so weak
*  All compared to like animals. Yeah, yeah an animal would fuck us up. So any any even a smallish animal would fuck us up
*  So we'll kick your fucking ass
*  Deer just kicking at you. Oh my god. Yeah
*  I get it. We need we need we need some help. We need some weapons. I wonder what we were like though
*  I mean imagine going back and seeing what a person was like when we started becoming people
*  How fucking freaky would that be like see that could be like scared of everything? Oh my god
*  Just real scared
*  but like
*  What would it be like to just hang out a tribe of neanderthals and see what they were likely a different kind of person?
*  Yeah, I wonder if it would be
*  I mean like mentally freeing, you know what I mean? You're singularly focused on food and shelter and not
*  You know, I don't know if you have the you're you know
*  You don't have a lot of like the fucking worries that we have but it could be awful simple
*  But at the same time the constant fear of starving and freezing to death that would be shit all of it's bad
*  Everything's bad. We're gonna get don't worry. We're gonna get there dude
*  We're gonna end up in water world pretty fucking soon
*  Which all right what future movie from the last 30 years?
*  Do you think our current reality is the closest to the matrix?
*  Really the matrix because you were living in a simulation you think?
*  It's gotten so weird that it doesn't matter whether or not we're living in a simulation
*  Because life itself and reality itself is almost
*  all
*  Augmented with some new factors like technology like whatever the technology is that we're using to communicate with all these people
*  Yeah, the fact that you're the algorithm stop checking your twitter
*  I want to check. Yeah, somebody say something cool. What's new? Who's got a fucking new video?
*  I can watch distract me for 15 seconds who Bert and Tom are in a dance off
*  Look at this and you're just constantly looking at the goddamn thing. Yeah
*  I am trying to i'm not doing well at it
*  But I gotta I gotta fucking get my phone out of my fucking hand that you know
*  What's a good guilt shamer is that little status thing? That's like, oh you've been on your phone for five hours and change
*  You know what they're like those are like the cigarette warnings to tell you you're gonna get cancer you're like somebody else
*  Not me. Yeah, i'm not addicted to my phone. I know I am I I feel like I am I try and I justify it to myself
*  Sometimes by saying well, I have a virtual job and I have to be doing this for work
*  But like I think that's not true a lot of the time. I think it's not true a lot of time
*  I think it's good to definitely give yourself some distance and some time away from it. But I also think it's fascinating because
*  I don't we don't know where this is going. Yeah, we don't know what this is gonna be like
*  An x amount of years from now
*  it's dangerous that these companies have so much control over the information that you see and that your
*  News feed and someone's news feed on the other side of the country or whatever could be just so much different
*  You just you're literally looking at different
*  Facts at us. It's fucking crazy. It is crazy. This is very crazy
*  I don't even know how you like, how do you reconcile that unless like
*  people voluntarily take responsibility is it is it possible to
*  Decide that facebook and twitter and whatever are like public utilities. Well, that's what
*  people have proposed that we we treat it like
*  Anything that you know that everybody kind of should have access to and we protect it under the first amendment
*  Yeah, that's the idea. I think that what's the net neutrality status right now today? I know it was like
*  Getting fought back and forth. Did it end up anywhere? I don't know
*  Do you remember when they used to have a terrorist? Um, like a color? Yeah orange. Yeah, like code orange
*  Yeah, we'd be all walking around like what are we are we in code orange or yellow? Did it get to yellow?
*  Yeah, somebody had a bit about that. Was it you? I'm sure I did
*  I remember bits of someone's bit about the code. I don't think I ever put it on anything
*  I don't know. I just had it when we had one
*  I think there was a few comics that had a bit on that too
*  That might have been part of the issue
*  It was one of those things where everybody was like recognizing how ridiculous it was. Yeah, it was we had codes
*  We have the fire the fire code now here, you know, the other is the car. Can you give me a code of?
*  Terrorist attack or no terrorist attack. What are you supposed to do about it? Actually, you're getting me closer to a possible terrorist attack
*  Okay, and you don't even have to tell me what's going on
*  That's that's where it gets crazy when it when it goes from orange to red. What do I do exactly? What do you do?
*  They don't even have to tell you what's going on. You can come to west side collector car storage. It's like a bunker. Oh, it's a bunker
*  It's designed to survive at 12
*  Yeah, that's a good place. It's a good place to hide out in case it all goes down for sure
*  I could see us bolting that store down and fucking fighting off zombies
*  Do you ever watch those zombie shows? I I am familiar. I had to stop
*  Yeah
*  Fuck you. This is just violent porn
*  Right. It was weird and then you start shopping for zombie apocalypse via has anyone been over that land cruiser out there?
*  Yeah, it's zombie apocalypse started you start thinking how would I fuck this zombie up? What would I do if I was rick?
*  I'll you know what I live. I live down by the beach. And so for me
*  I legit am like what am I gonna do when the tsunami comes? Oh, that's i'm just waiting for the tsunami. What are you doing?
*  Don't you know better off the water? Yeah, right. I know I don't want to lose you
*  I don't i'm i'm actually waiting for like waves to just come straight through beachfront pasadena sun
*  Get that high rise. Yeah buy some land. Oh your shit's not front row. Just wait
*  Just wait. Yeah, that's a what the fuck happens then if your address doesn't exist anymore, right?
*  Right, like we all know that they find these ancient civilizations underneath the ocean
*  Maybe they do find I mean, I don't find that, you know, they've never found atlantis, but they've found some pretty cool shit
*  Yeah, the ocean. Yeah, do you ever see those things they found? Um, I think in the bahamas
*  It's like these stones that look like it looks like um, like passageway like cut stones cut into the ground
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah
*  These gigantic stones looks like some sort of an underground passage or an underwater passageway
*  It seems like I remember that I think at one point there were like probably entrances made of wood or something
*  That you know have rotted away
*  And yeah, yeah
*  Underground stones. Yeah, I don't know. No, did they identify that those do they think those are man-made?
*  Do they think that they're man-made or are there scientists that think that that's a natural isn't there?
*  There's a portion of that that is absolutely that's it's called bimini road, right? Yeah, yeah road
*  Yeah, so is that for sure man-made?
*  I I could swear portions of it are
*  That's cool as fuck though. This I don't know. I this is just reminding me of something
*  I just heard recently that I did never I did never come up on here from what I remember that there's like a stone hinge
*  Type structure on the bottom of lake michigan that people found recently. Really what?
*  What the fuck
*  Joe's conspiracy radar just went off the fucking charts kind of ones. I like too. I don't like conspiracies about abstinence
*  They're freaking michigan stone. Look at that people are still alive. That's pretty
*  There's a lot of weird pictures
*  I've seen of this channel looked up to think that there's like a mastodon carve
*  I don't think that's the actual one. Whoa, I think someone added to this but that looks like it was done in spray paint in
*  2018
*  It's that but it I don't I just stumbled across this online while we were on break on break last week
*  And I was like what I've never heard of this. I need to start using some of your guys keywords
*  To start searching for shit. I feel like my keywords are are narrow when i'm doing my my internet
*  Fucking time-wasting and i'm i'm not getting the kind of results you guys are getting
*  This book that i've been listening to is so intense man the indian one
*  All it makes me think about is like how all this shit must have been when it went down
*  Just the bloodiness of it. Oh my god, it's horrific on both sides. Oh terrific
*  horrific just
*  terrifying stories of
*  Who recorded the stories people that survived people that wrote letters to their loved ones that you know, they they they piece things together
*  Find out what happened crazy get their best story the best story they can get about like custard's last stand and what he was like
*  Whoa, dude, just that's 150 160 years ago. Yeah, that's nothing. I know that just happened
*  I know it's real recent those fucking people were just like us. I know we have iphones
*  Exactly. Yeah, those crazy people. I think I might have told you this last time I was here
*  I don't remember that I met dick van dyke. Holy shit, which was surreal and weird. I think he's 92
*  But the the most surreal and weird thing he told me was that his grandmother shook abraham lincoln's hand
*  Oh my god, so like that's you know what I mean? Uh, the grandmother of somebody alive right now
*  I did tell you that I think that's fucking amazing because I think it just happened when I was here dude
*  Like possible and I think there's a president
*  Uh like the eighth or tenth president or something right now that had like has like a living grandchild
*  What the fuck? Yeah, like had kids at 75 had kids at 75. It's it's it's fucking crazy
*  That's not that long ago. That's people just like us with none of the
*  Information that we have it's so recent. Yeah, you know, there it goes
*  Liongardener tyler senior two of his own children still alive. So president tyler has living grandchildren
*  john tyler
*  175 years ago
*  I had a bid on my special my last special where I was talking about
*  That the united states is founded in 1776 and people live to be 100. That's three people. Yeah
*  Yeah, like we don't want to think of that. Yeah, but that's really what it is
*  Yeah, fuck all this generations talk that's confusing. Yeah, how many people ago?
*  Yeah birth to death
*  Tell me it's not a lot. They they are fucking same as us. It's 300 years
*  No tech. Yeah
*  If you're gonna gauge it like a car, what's your zero to 60?
*  And it's a hundred years from a hundred years ago. Yeah, it's like three people ago
*  It's fucking crazy with a full that's like a full elon musk tank, right?
*  Because like if you burn it out, you're not going to live to be 100
*  Yeah, but some people do get to be 100 miles on that fucking charge. There's cars around now
*  Yes, and they work you can drive them. Yeah, a friend of mine has many they're kind of fun actually dude. It's um,
*  It's that's a weird concept, right?
*  Yeah
*  We're going from the horse
*  To where we're at now in no time. A hundred years is bananas in no time. Yeah
*  which is why like
*  you know, I I believe like that
*  like electric cars are awesome and they're cool and and
*  I think that in places like really dense urban areas where where you have a significant number of them
*  You get cleaner air and all that kind of stuff
*  but
*  I I just don't know if that's necessarily what our
*  future requires because I think that like
*  The big the big the big industries have have sort of done this
*  well
*  if everybody does our little part and we all buy an electric car and recycle we can solve this when it's really sort of like
*  Maybe a few less cargo ships would be would be a big a big difference maybe like
*  Guaranteeing stuff gets from china to you in 12 hours is not really what we need
*  At the expense of our environment and if that's the I don't think
*  You need to like, you know have everybody needs to go buy an electric car. I don't think that's really necessary
*  Well, there's a lot of shit that needs to be done. Yeah, like we got it. Whatever the fuck is going on in the ocean
*  Yeah
*  We got to get people to feel about the whole ocean the way we feel about turtles and straws
*  If we can just get that sentiment and apply it to all apply it to our neighbors apply to everyone you meet
*  It's weird. I think americans have a really tough time taking care of communal shit
*  Yeah, but I can't find a fucking plastic straw anymore. I know it's amazing. I know how quickly that happened
*  The plastic straw the dude with the pliers
*  He's pulling out of the turtle's nose and eventually comes out with all this blood and everything like that
*  You need an ugly photograph of a cute animal to really make things happen
*  But I walked I literally walked to the gym this morning and took from my house to the gym
*  I walk across the venice canals. Yeah, and I saw two bird scooters just in the canals just
*  So it's like, you know people just can't take care of their shit
*  That's why you can't have like shared stuff like the idea of these like shared
*  Kind of like pods. I don't really think is gonna happen. I think people are shared pods like you live
*  Yeah, like like, you know a lot of the people that are
*  I mean low on resources minority report, you know where you can work in a pod
*  Oh, you don't think that's gonna have like flying through the air and shit the tycan makes the jetsons noise
*  No when you drive it it makes the brr the really? Yeah, it does make does it do it for you?
*  Like it's a joke or does it make real noise?
*  No, it does it out of the speakers as a as a way as a fun thing
*  I feel like you can let it slide. You know why because it's not pretending to be an engine. No, no
*  Right. It makes it makes an appropriate noise for the thing that it's doing
*  It's kind of offensive if it made an engine noise, you'd be like hey, hey, yeah
*  Stop, although I think did elon ever come out with the tesla come out with the thing that would fake that would fake engine soundtracks
*  While you're driving really?
*  Someone does somebody came up with something that you can put in your car and it will play different engine soundtracks
*  I think while you're driving tiffany haddish made her fucking car dance
*  In what way the the tesla has a feature. Oh where it opens the doors and shit and does lights
*  She's got the one with the gull wings. Yeah. Yeah
*  She plays music in the back of the comic store and and and hits the the dance
*  And steps out and she's dancing in front of her car. We're all dancing
*  We're dancing in front of tiffany haddish's car
*  You know dancing for us. That's the the difference between porsche and tesla is like tesla's it's like a meme machine
*  It's like a phone that you're driving, you know, it's it's it's it's fun and it's silly and
*  Especially the model x that is a very optimistic
*  representation of the future
*  Um, what is that? Oh pedestrian noise makers. Yeah
*  So that that's a different thing
*  I think the take the tycoon doesn't really make any noise on the outside
*  It makes the noises on the inside if we're gonna have noise that it makes on the outside
*  It better be we better regulate that immediately because some dudes are just gonna have screams
*  If you can just decide what noise your silent thing makes how the fuck should you say I had it has to sound like a corvette
*  I had a chevy volt that had two horns it had the on the steering wheel the
*  Angry horn and then at the end of the blinker stalk it had this really
*  Polite like trill for like pedestrians for that we go like like a like a cat purring almost it was very polite
*  Um, it's just weird that we let people drive
*  It's weird that we just we trust each other like when you're on the highway and everybody's keeping it together
*  It's weird that we just all know to keep it together
*  There's a there's a really interesting fallacy that that gets passed around a lot
*  Which is that humans are bad drivers and that's combined with another fallacy that driving is easy
*  Both of those are untrue humans are actually very good drivers and driving is very hard
*  And and the problem is that humans are so easily distracted and we now have this device that is designed to distract us
*  That's with us all the time dude
*  How often you look up when you're driving you see someone on their phone on my scooter?
*  Um when i'm riding my motorcycle around town, that's all I do is i'm looking in mirrors and seeing who's not paying attention
*  But um ed norton still rides a motorcycle. I know I was listening him talking about that
*  He's talking about looking down watching people
*  How crazy is that guy the key to riding a motorcycle in la is to?
*  Understand that is your job to be more prepared than everyone in a car
*  I think and we'll pay more attention mostly he rides in new york city. Yeah, he he was a little more
*  uh
*  He wasn't as kind to riding in la as I am
*  I think riding in la is not that scary and I think that because you can lane split here
*  Um, it makes a big difference. It's way safer to lane split. Yeah
*  Yeah way safer because most uh car on motorcycle collisions are actually rear endings at lights
*  People can't tell the difference between the bike and the car and they crunch them
*  And so if you're lane splitting you move to the front of the line in traffic
*  And so you don't get those rear endings the problem with lane splitting is that sometimes people look like they're going to go
*  And change lanes and you look behind them and then when they look the motorcycle is going so fast. They're already there
*  Well, you shouldn't be going that fast. I'm going that fast
*  I've seen some guys that are doing some crazy shit. I know like splitting lanes
*  It's like come on the law says 15 differential 15 between cars
*  Between your speed on the bike and cars. Oh, well, that's not real. I mean that's just what the law says
*  I don't know. Yeah, but there's people who do like 70. Yeah
*  Yeah, there's I saw some dudes the other day on the 405 that made me so nervous. Yeah crazy sport bike people
*  Yeah, crazy sport bike people will be crazy sport bike people but that thing if you can manage that thing
*  One of those fucking things your reality is so different than anybody else
*  Yeah, right if you're written bikes ever no, I mean very little very very very little I took some lessons
*  but uh two people I know crashed and got hurt pretty bad and
*  One of them was a dude who's fighting for the ufc. His name is frank meir. He was a ufc heavyweight champion
*  Dude who's
*  Got one of the best guards in the history of the sport arguably one of the best submission fighters of all time
*  Yeah in the heavyweight division, you know world champion still fighting or after the accident
*  No, he is but he got hit by a car and got launched into the air man
*  And he almost lost his leg. He was a serious break. Yeah
*  Well his car his leg got crunched in between car and motorcycle engine. Yeah, that's that's really bad dude. He's a gorilla
*  He's a giant dude. No, it's a for him. It's gnarly man
*  I
*  Motorcycling is a very is risky. It's it's for me. It's a pretty calculated risk. I'm riding a little scooter
*  When you ride a scooter versus a motorcycle, you don't get that leg crunch thing actually
*  um, and I you know, it is what it is you just gotta you gotta have eyes up you gotta be ready and you gotta be
*  You know, you can't like have a beer and then ride home. You just you could feel it
*  You can't do it
*  I mean you shouldn't but even if you you know legally or what you still shouldn't do it
*  and so it and and also like
*  I love
*  Love that. I can't pick up the fucking phone
*  On that bike that half hour on my little scooter getting my way through traffic to wherever i'm going
*  That's a nice break from the fucking phone and being able to just be in motion in la and
*  You know and you're you're just going even if you're going slow 10 miles an hour
*  Everyone around you stopped and you're moving. That's the fucking luxury man. That's what i'm about
*  I'm about being moving when other people are stopped. Mm-hmm. That's for me. That's what's up might be time to move
*  Might be time like you have to hire a crew. I know here your your machine with all the
*  It's giant building with all the cars in it and just get out of here before it blows up
*  It's hard. It's a hard dichotomy la if you want to do the job
*  I have la is kind of where you need to be it's the spot, right bro
*  I you know, I can get a press car I can get an 800 horsepower supercar press car in january if I wanted you can't do that
*  And in back in the more cars than you
*  I've reviewed over a thousand cars. That is so crazy a lot. Well, that's why you developed all these oddball tastes
*  That's why you have that wacky Porsche interior. I mean, that's what all that comes from because the weirdest cars do it
*  Like I only have strange stuff
*  I have my I just fox. I just got a mustang. I sold that I did I got a lot of money for it
*  I gave half the money to charity. Oh, that's beautiful. Yeah, we paid it. We paid an animal shelters rent for a year
*  Oh, that's a shout out to Peter zippy fund if you want a kitten in the south bay
*  Um, I just got uh me and my wife just got a 1991
*  Mitsubishi delica, which is a japanese import van
*  And it's a turbo diesel. It's a four by four and it's a six passenger
*  It has like swiveling captain's chairs and it's just the coolest thing ever. There it is. Whoa, look at that. Look at that
*  Um, and it is it's they it's like a space van dude back in the day. That was the shit
*  Yeah, mine's got 40 000 kilometers on it. It's like 22 000 miles and i'm using it as the airport shuttle for my for my shop
*  That's very like that's what we thought of as a car from the future in the 80s space fan
*  Like if you were living in the 80s, remember when what I want to know what the fuck happened to custom vans
*  Like oh well now well, they've now custom friends are a new thing. So now custom vans have gone two directions
*  On the one direction you've got your the private jet vans, right?
*  The lexani like you see fucking tyrese rolling and rolling around right where they make it kind of look like a private jet interior
*  With the sprinters and then you've got your overland vans like your sports mobiles
*  And your camping type rigs your off-roading rigs so they split they don't do the cool shag carpet. Let's fuck anymore
*  They don't have was that there's a magazine called rolling heavy magazine that is a enthusiast magazine for that kind of van
*  That's hilarious. That's hilarious. Yeah
*  Vans are still uh, they're cool with a certain subculture
*  Those volkswagen
*  Syncros the four by four volkswagen vans from the 80s are worth a ton of money like really 50 grand
*  Yeah, they're worth a lot of money dude. It's hilarious when they take those bugs those uh, be those those
*  This what is the station wagon the vw bus? Yeah, and they put porsche engines in them
*  You ever see them guys racing up. Yeah, they put they take the old vans from the 60s and 70s the classic volkswagen
*  Microbus yeah, and then you they basically graphed on a porsche floor plan to it with a porsche engine
*  Which will fit porsche suspension and they go fast as fuck dude. They race on things in germany
*  Can you pull up anything of there? I want to see one of those at hockenheim
*  Look, this dude's just straight. Look this guy's following a ferrari down the front straight. Oh my god
*  This guy's mobbing and he chopped the roof right? He's he's he's lowered it
*  If you can get some in-car video of one of these guys driving, it's like bananas. What a crazy little vehicle
*  Yeah, there's other ones that are even even nuttier and uh, oh, there you go. It's close-ups. Um
*  They're just crazy some of these volkswagen guys. Oh, wow. He's really using the whole course there good for him
*  So that's a nine hundred five hundred and thirty horsepower portion 993
*  Race taxi. Oh, how cool he's got uh, gabriel glazes
*  Is fluffy a fucking van enthusiast?
*  Jesus christ, bro
*  What are you doing fluffy?
*  Whoa fluffy's garage is fucking sick, dude
*  This is real fuck
*  In long beach, this is here how have we never heard of this
*  bro
*  This is a real thing. This is a real thing. Look at wow
*  He must have really loved these things growing up. That's hysterical. That is crazy. How many does he have a lot?
*  Well that orange and red is fantastic. That's really nice. I had no idea fluffy was a vw bus enthusiast
*  Oh, we've got to get him in one of these strange is that
*  People that are into those are really really into those seinfeld's got a few of them, too
*  How many he has three million dollar bus collection? Well, that is bananas
*  Yeah
*  And you know they they sell those like if you want like a the 21 window they call it or the 23 window
*  That's where it's got the extra windows on the roof. The total number of windows is the normally is like
*  17 or whatever but the 21 windows and the 23 windows are like 100 to 150 thousand dollars
*  What? Yeah. Wow, just because they're rare and and look how beautiful he has these things restored
*  Yeah, you ever drive one god. No the worst
*  I drive like shit. They drive like fucking garbage. So do you think he has everything stock or do you think probably juiced up?
*  I don't know. I mean an enthusiast. I didn't realize he was such a serious. He was so serious about those but i'm sure he's got
*  A nice variety of them. He's got jay driving
*  Jay, jay knows his shit man. I had a real fun day hanging out with jay doing his show. He knows his shit
*  Yeah, I did his his show with my 1965 corvette. How is that thing working? I saw it outside
*  I like the wheels you've got on great. Yeah. Yeah, what are you driving the most these days? Is this the tesla?
*  Yeah, the tesla does kind of eliminate a lot of other driving doesn't other nonsense like why am I fucking around?
*  I know because it's just it's so easy. I know it chills you out. I know it makes you uh,
*  I mean there's something exciting about the roar of an engine, right? There's something about engines. There's something really like something about it
*  But
*  There's also something about this sort of zen. Yeah travel absolutely goes on absolutely your car doesn't make any noise
*  Yeah, there's a zen thing. Yeah, I think it calms you down a little bit
*  It does you get you're a little more relaxed when you get to where you're going and then quiet inside
*  And also part of that is well a lot of that is just you don't really realize how
*  harsh
*  The vibration of an engine is until it's gone
*  You know and even a even a very smooth engine with a very smooth gearbox
*  Sends a lot of vibrations and jerkiness through the car and when it's gone
*  Especially with the tesla where you're driving with the one foot driving with one pedal
*  So now it's like you go from wow
*  I need to use three pedals and two feet and an arm to a finger and one foot, you know
*  You're you're physically doing a lot less
*  But you used to say that you liked your portion to go to the comedy store because it like juiced you up
*  You still feel like that? Yeah, I like I like something loud
*  Something that's just stupid. Yeah
*  You got to get the zone. Yeah, but it just gives you like a little bit of a just like a kickstart
*  Yeah, you don't even have to drive fast. It's not about that. It's about what it can do
*  It's like you're taking it out for this like it just moves better. It moves around corners better. It's grips the road better
*  It feels more more mechanical
*  Yeah, my 911 is kind of like that but in it's actually got the the elements of like a baja truck also
*  So you could just fucking smash speed bumps and like, you know those weird transitions into driveways here that everybody hates in sports cars
*  You're gonna take one an angle and all that. Yeah boom straight in on the power
*  Just kind of bounce it a little bit. You could drive off of curbs and shit. It is so fun
*  It's all those things you love about your car
*  But also the things you want in like a trophy truck. Jesus it rules
*  So great, you should be a salesman. I am no I don't get kickbacks
*  But but you should everybody should buy an off-road Porsche. It's fucking great hilarious
*  Yeah of all the recommendations a lot of people out there consumer
*  Stay in school and get your shit together. Jordan Peterson says to clean your room, dude
*  You don't want to come for me for good consumer advice. I'll tell you to buy some stupid shit
*  I only have stupid cars
*  I love the fact that you dump so much money into that mustang because they're like that's the
*  No, no disrespect. That's okay. It's true
*  What I feel is the second ugliest version
*  It's it was kind of unique at the time. Yeah, it wasn't ugly in the time. You and Rutledge spent mad time talking shit about my mustang
*  It's just an odd choice because you you're a connoisseur of automobiles, right?
*  Like in my mind i'm like, why wouldn't he get like a 68 mustang? I don't have a connection to those cars
*  You know, yeah, I was I was I was born in 81 so I so to me the mustangs of my youth
*  Were that was my car larry chen shot that photo. That does look pretty dope. Um, oh the car was beautiful, man
*  That that was a beautiful car and I did dump a lot of money into it
*  But I turned I got on the cover of car craft magazine
*  I had a speech a feature in speed hunters and I and I got all my money back out of it
*  Even after I gave half the money to charity, so I got out of it pretty good
*  It's fantastic and you deserve every penny of it drove really nice too
*  Look at the suspension like the way it sits rather the right the fat wide tires got the right stance
*  Those are awesome wheels, too. What are those wheels? The wheels are hre rs 105s, which is a really popular wheel for the 4gt
*  They use so that's probably the cheapest car they've ever been on the wheels
*  12 side picture that the wheels retail for like 12k. They're really expensive. Yeah. Yeah pretty
*  Yeah, I mean, i'm sure if joe rogan wanted a deal we could probably get something worked out with hre
*  But that's so that car was so cool. But you know after it was done
*  Like that picture you just saw is it done basically and once it was done. I was like, oh fuck man
*  You know this thing handles so good and it looks so cool
*  It could really use like 300 more horsepower
*  Like it was like it was like 300 horsepower 350 horsepower and it really needed to be like 600
*  and so I was at the point where I either
*  Was gonna spend two more years and 20 more thousand dollars
*  And maybe i'd be happy with what I got at the end or it was just time to move on and at about the same time I drove
*  Lee keen is the name of the dude who built my porsche and he builds and sells those mine is number 14 of the cars
*  He builds I drove his for a video
*  And I just was so in love with it and I just said oh
*  This is exactly the thing that I need in my life right now
*  And so when I sold the mustang I I gave the money to lee keen and got a lifted 911
*  That's a good consumer advice took that as your daily driver
*  Yeah, why don't I love in combination with the scooter and and the test cars I have but that's hilarious
*  Yeah, your number one squeeze. Yeah, is this safari?
*  911 from 1987 I didn't spend all that money to look at it
*  You know, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right if you if I spent all that money it has no collector value, right?
*  It's just the value is is what I get out of driving
*  Isn't it shocking when you open one of those old porsches the the heft to it the the surprising the solidness of it
*  Yes, I mean those those galvanized porsche bodies from the 60s to the mid 90s
*  Are some of the finest built?
*  Vehicles in terms of quality and engineering. They're not expensive to maintain
*  They can be annoying but as far as pure quality of engineering
*  There's there's nothing better. Yeah, it's probably the finest car in the world from a quality perspective through most of its life
*  Yeah, the 964 is a really unusual one for me because um that year was like they still kept the frog eyes
*  Yeah, but the suspension became more more lively a little bit more controllable
*  But yet it still maintained a lot of the old feel
*  What at the time those cars if you go back to 92 when those cars came out in 91?
*  And you read sort of the contemporary reviews of the car. They were calling it old slow and heavy
*  You know, they said it was a solid feeling car, but the corvette zr1 was way faster and lighter
*  You know what I mean? And and the ferrari, um, let's see that. Well, the 348 was a piece of shit, but um
*  The fuck else 92 some of the japanese stuff the supra the 300 zx twin turbo
*  You know, these were modern cars with with turbo chargers and you know all this new cool shit
*  And here was this sort of well, that's 9-elevens really still sort of the same since the 60s, you know
*  And so that kind of dragged on but to to to revisit those cars now
*  The fact that they were unchanged from the 60s to the mid 90s is an is a positive. It's an endearing quality
*  It's it's it's such a um, they developed that
*  body and chassis so thoroughly over those 30 years that
*  It's such a finely engineered thing that you can take it and build something like a singer out of it a singer 911
*  It is as like I remember their regular car, right?
*  Is as fast around laguna seca as a ferrari 458 with no traction control and manually shifting
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah
*  I mean they've done wonders with those chassis and they've really lightened them with carbon bodies and and so
*  It is possible to take that chassis further. It just would have cost porsche porsche lost so much money in the 90s, dude
*  porsche was really hanging on by a thread and they were losing money like crazy until volkswagen
*  Aero group came in and that's where you ended up with the water-cooled cars the boxter and then the cayenne
*  But in the 90s when they were doing the 993s from like night they were losing a crazy amount of money on those cars
*  Really? Yeah. Yeah
*  Anyway, it's a weird car, right? It's like they stuck with that crazy design for so long. Yeah, it feels it feels old
*  It feels like 25 years older than it really is and yet it is so finely made
*  Yeah, so interesting right so a strange combination, right?
*  As opposed to something like that's a crazy that's a 993 gt, uh, a carrera rs
*  Beautiful. Yeah, that's very nice. That's a beautiful car
*  so, you know if you look at the passenger compartment the roof line the windshield the side windows of those cars, you know, that's basically
*  unchanged from the
*  70s to the to late 90s. It's such a pretty shape. It's just like some shape that people just
*  Gravitate towards and it's a shoe. Well, they're really old ones
*  Something about an old one when you see him in person like if you see a really nicely done like 71 long nose
*  Yeah, there's something about them. You're like, they're so they're so light
*  You know, they they have they're kind of airy about them. I just I think you know of all the classic cars
*  They are the most usable
*  You know to just run around the city and drive, you know, you can drive a car from the 70s
*  You know magnus fucking drives that car
*  Oh, you know
*  Cars from the 70s like no problem. You could do that dude magnus had this car that he sold some rock and roll star
*  In england he had this uh silver with blue stripes and it was like a 69 or something like that
*  I think I remember that car. Yeah. Oh my god. That car was a magic thing. He's got he's got cool
*  There's a video of him like driving it going around this corner, you know, he had that video that they made about him
*  Yeah, it's like a little short document outlaw. That's it. That's it
*  And he comes around in this old school silver Porsche and you look at it like
*  That's a whole different thing. He's doing than everybody else
*  And he's not even driving fast like you don't even have to drive fast in that thing. It weighs what does it weigh?
*  I mean 2,500 pounds maybe it's so light maybe and it doesn't have a lot of power either
*  Well, one of the things I love about my car is with the lift on it and the tires
*  You've got like less grip than a normal line of and so if nobody's around like I can slide entrance ramps
*  Like I can be a silly bastard in in uh in that car and it's it's just extra fun because this
*  Oh, yeah, that is the silver car with the blue. Yeah, that's an excellent car cool
*  Yeah, even when you hear the engine it doesn't sound like anything else. Yeah, it's a weird little mechanical creature
*  Yeah, because of their small displacement. That's probably a two or a two or a two two, you know
*  It's not like this big bore 38 like you've got or you know, i've got a three two
*  Which is a bit more of a basey kind of tone. Yeah, the older engines have a higher pitch
*  It's like really those ones are so 60s ones are little god damn
*  But they're still pretty big inside like it's the same size inside
*  As your car like you could get in it and drive it and it's like even those
*  356s the really old porches in the 50s like those are actually kind of roomy like when you put that engine in the back
*  Yeah, your feet can go. Oh pretty far forward. Yeah, the germans are pretty big people, too
*  Yeah, one of the things with porsche specifically is is about tall people fitting
*  They got barbarian dna man, right and the ceo of porsche for a very long time was six four
*  And so they he demanded that's why panamera looks like it does so that a six foot four person can fit in the back
*  That's exactly that reason. Oh, wow. Yeah, what'd they do with the back seat of the 911?
*  So those are ridiculous. Well, those are for kids. They're like little kids. Yeah
*  I don't I think that's an insurance thing. I think by being a four seater
*  Be able to that makes sense. Yeah, you're right. I just don't have rear seats
*  No, I mean you could have a friend get in the back of your 911 for a couple of blocks
*  Yeah, yeah, it's possible, but it's more like you just you know, you throw your duffel bag back there or whatever
*  It's just too tight. It's too tight, but the ones you buy don't have rear seats
*  So what do you care? You buy the rs's they don't have the rear seats
*  Wow, well if I drive like one of those cars, especially the older ones like um, you know like the 964
*  I'd like the most stripped down ones. That's what I like. Yeah, it makes sense the more like I don't want a radio
*  I don't want I like a radio. I don't want air conditioning
*  Nothing. I use my car every day and so I have a radio and air conditioning
*  But yeah, I know what you mean, but a car like that like a little ride
*  Yeah, it's like you're taking a ride more than it is like you're driving. No driving is the thing
*  Yeah, that's what you're doing. You're driving. Yeah, that's my lamborghini
*  I treat like that when I when I I don't take that to do bullshit when I go out and drive that car like that
*  Is my activity? Yeah, so like a guy like magnus he's experiencing
*  You know what a normal person experiences when they're enjoying the pleasure of driving, but he's getting a way more analog
*  Way more super light car
*  It's all ancient fucking tech. Those light cars are real easy to drive though when you've got a little engine
*  You can give a light clutch. You can have a light shifter. You don't need you know, the more power you've got
*  The heavier duty everything needs to be
*  So when you dial that stuff back and the car is two thousand pounds and the engine is only 200 horsepower
*  You can just fingertip the whole thing. It's very easy. Yeah, my friend todd just said this to me
*  It was a very wise thing. He said it doesn't matter how fast you're going just matter how fast it feels totally
*  He was talking about like old 9-eleven thousand percent a thousand percent. It's wise wise
*  Like it's a wise perspective because you go. Oh, yeah, have you just enjoying the car?
*  Like you're supposed to get maximum enjoyment
*  Like it doesn't have to be attached to a number correct
*  Like if you didn't know how fast you're going you weren't looking at your car other than for the purposes of safety
*  Yeah, yeah, you weren't like it wasn't a dick contest. There'd be a certain level you wouldn't want to drive at
*  I believe I agree even knowing the speeds like for me personally. Yeah, like
*  My my cars have fairly low low power
*  Like they're not crazy huge power cars like and I think beyond a certain point
*  I just can't use it anymore. And so I think
*  there's an argument for having something like a tesla for every day and then having a an engaging machine for
*  The weekends one of my favorite videos that you ever did was that?
*  Is it was it bbi that did? Yeah. Oh joey sealy's car. Yeah, you know that car is for sale. Is it really?
*  Yep, you want it?
*  Cars first that's a lovely car and it is it is for sale. It was called project nasty
*  And I think he got it down to maybe 2200 pounds
*  It was it's the lightest nine six four I ever drove but it was so light. I had no headliner
*  Yeah, no metal inside of it and everything. I remember watching going look at that thing
*  Yeah, but that's what you said that was really interesting was that this is the kind of car you build
*  When you you know, you make cars for other people
*  Yeah, and you want to build something for yourself you build something like that most focused kind of thing
*  That company's known for like these really
*  High-end
*  Like custom builds of porsches and they make crazy fast things, dude
*  You can buy I mean you can you can write a check right now
*  You can just write a check walk away come back in two months and have like a 1500 horsepower 911
*  Because these guys, you know, these guys race runways out here now
*  That's like the thing now is run runway racing
*  So they go out and they go side by side half mile and they're doing like 220 230 in the half mile
*  You ever see a video? I'm sure you have of the guy in the gtr on the nurburgring and just catches air. Oh, yeah
*  Dude nurburgring contest sir. That's fucking terrifying. You should go drive a nurburgring if you have it
*  You really should you a guy fly? Yeah, but you wouldn't you wouldn't fly through the air
*  You wouldn't fly you would drive the nurburgring in a more normal car that doesn't fly
*  Yeah, I would drive something and by the way after that they change they they
*  Resculpted that section of track really? Yes, they they for a period of time
*  Chained they imposed a speed limit even during races through that section
*  To prevent that from happening again
*  They changed I believe the rules of the racing series to slow the cars down and then I believe
*  Um, they resculpted the track there as well after that incident
*  So they couldn't catch air like that or at least to make it substantially less likely
*  Yeah, that fucking car is catching air is a you gooseneck then your next internet dive goop go google race car race cars
*  No, I'm gonna attempt to look for that but I just there's just the gts. Yeah
*  Yeah, you can't you can't google nurburgring crash and not end up with uh, people are going so fast and people lose it all the time
*  Dude, it's the it's such a fun
*  scary crazy place it's every
*  Every reputation that every bit of reputation it's earned it deserves and it's
*  But you go to doing it is like one of the more unique experiences of your life
*  And you don't have to like, you know, like you said you don't have to go for time
*  You can just go and drive it as a fast fun road, which is what i've done as americans
*  We should be ashamed that the germans have the nurburgring. I mean, come on hitler built it if we want to
*  We want to really be did he really?
*  I mean he didn't physically lay the asphalt but it was a hitler
*  It was a fourth rike superiority thing right alongside the autobahn
*  Some race tracks best race cars best highways as part of their deal. Wow, that makes sense
*  There was so much engineering that came out of that group of fucking psychos. Yeah, really
*  Oh speaking of which I read a book you'd love called blitzed drugs of the third rike
*  That was basically just about how much meth they were all on and it is nuts, of course
*  Yeah, of course. Yeah, dude. They've been on speed forever as soon as they figured out speed people were on speed
*  And they're giving it to the pilots and the soldiers and hitler had a speed probably was doing speed balls
*  Like fucking john belushi. I mean it was it was crazy
*  Yeah, there was there was theorized that they had given the japanese amphetamines to get them to crash into the plane
*  Yeah, uh crashed their planes into the boats rather. Yeah, kamikazes. Yeah, that was the thought like totally believable
*  Metham up and fucking send them to war. There's a story in this book about their they at the very end of the war where they
*  Invented these single person
*  submarines imagine one basically just a floating coffin and they sent these people out with like
*  10 tablets of meth and nothing else and this little submarine that had a little gun and like none of them came back
*  They all just can't
*  Not that I have sympathy for nazis, but messed up soldiers in death submarines. Maybe a little bit
*  Is that what it was that little thing?
*  I don't think it worked. I think of this they tried a bunch of times in it
*  It's a fucking sketchy. Oh my god. Yeah, it's it doesn't get much sketchier than that
*  There is the one with the little bubble on top is it the german one man thing? Yeah, the little bubble on top
*  That's it
*  It the picture I saw had the bubble somewhere in columbia. There's a dude with a thousand pounds of coke
*  One of those right now just got a great idea
*  As well
*  They had that video where like they had the coast guard knocked on the submarine
*  They had a cartel sub
*  They just knocked it said open up. Was it the coast guard? They got the guys?
*  Yeah, they're like open the literally knocking on the literally did they open up?
*  Yeah, they jumped on top of a goddamn submarine and made the guys open the pelt open the sides bro
*  It is bonkers. It's right out of a goddamn steven saddam
*  It's crazy that's fucking so nuts they jump on top of the roof of this fucking submarine
*  Holy shit. Look at this. Yeah, see so they're chasing them. They're screaming. Oh my god
*  Yo, this is the craziest shit ever dude, dude, how crazy is this?
*  This is things like what 25 foot long sub? Yeah, so these guys are following behind it
*  And he jumps off look at this bad motherfucker
*  Do you think this sub is capable of full submerging or this is the closest to sub that it gets
*  Full probably can't go down like a hundred feet, but maybe like holy fucking shit
*  This dude straight up knocks the door and they opened it. That's so crazy
*  I need your search terms. You are finding way better things than me on the internet
*  Who is you know, like who is taking subs?
*  And and filling them up with coke they're building them shit
*  Way to another country how many dudes are doing that that they had that whole big ship in philadelphia
*  That cargo ship that was supposedly owned by chase, but like had 200 or 400 million dollars worth of cocaine really
*  There was one, you know the uh, the dacar the paris to dacar rally is it's a car race like cars like my safari
*  Are like built for that right and it's uh, there's these you know
*  There's race cars and there's race motorcycles and quads and stuff off-road vehicles that do very long off-road race
*  And then there's these support trucks, right and they they race the trucks too
*  So it's like these like kamas and like man trucks big off-road tires huge engines and they're the trucks are in the race
*  And so these coke smugglers the trucks the bet in the back of the truck is enough parts to like rebuild the whole car
*  And the truck has a racing driver and a five mechanics crew and they chase the car if the car breaks
*  They fucking pull it over and set up a shop and rebuild the car, right?
*  But they're in the race too
*  And so these coke smugglers bought one of these dacar race trucks
*  Did it up like the livery and just like a couple miles after the start just like entered the race
*  And they entered the race with this truck fucking full of blow
*  Oh my god, it's a movie and they got stopped like I don't know somewhere in the race. They got arrested with this this race truck
*  Oh
*  What is this jamie sell chapos? So that's el chapo
*  13,000 tons of cocaine 13 000 pounds. I'm sorry. That's like seven and a half times, but wow
*  That is crazy
*  Oh my god 13 000 pounds this Jesus this one was in europe it had 100 million
*  Pounds worth. Oh my god. These guys are just building this shit in there
*  Tons and tons of them. Yeah reminds me that was that movie with ray leota no escape
*  They built the sub ray leota and kevin dillon in that shit. No
*  Yeah, what was that movie? No, I think it was no escape when they're on the prison island and they get this then build a sub
*  Can they still make movies like that?
*  I just saw i've seen some good movies. You see ford verse ferrari ford verse ferrari is good. I bet it's good
*  It's good. It's mostly factual. It's not it's not entirely perfect, but it's like more accurate than like bohemian rhapsody
*  Do you remember lamans steve mcqueen? Yes, remember when he was driving in the beginning and that's old-ass porsche
*  Yes, that was exactly what we're talking about. Yeah, I was a race car driver
*  Who's the car he drives around is that old 911?
*  That car sold for a lot of money. Oh, I bet it did that mood. Do you like lamon the movie?
*  Um, I don't remember it enough. There's like no speaking for like the first nine or ten minutes
*  Yeah, I think it's beautiful because it's like it really puts you in the mood of what it's like to be
*  These people without without saying too much. They would do that in movies back then man
*  You know, yeah, they they're really slow pacing kind of quiet sort of pensive thing
*  You know, you should go and watch if you haven't seen it before watch again the hustler
*  Never seen it jackie gleason and paul newman. No, i've never seen it. It's amazing. It's amazing for what reason?
*  It's just it's a fuck first of all, it's uh, it's in the 1960s like early 1960s
*  And you're you're seeing like this part of america because this is filmed
*  Representing the time in which it took place. It's not like they were doing a period movie
*  So this is like 1960s like early 1960s cars and the way they talk and the way they drink
*  And it's about this guy who's a professional pool hustler who's been traveling from california
*  To new york city to meet this guy in minnesota fats and play him because this guy's the best pool player in the world
*  And so they play all through the night. It's based on a I think was it robert rosen?
*  Is that the said robert? Yeah, you said robert rosen. Yeah, it's based on a a very you say paul newman is in this
*  Yes, that's paul newman. Oh fuck it is look at that dude and paul newman plays fast eddie felson
*  He plays the baddest motherfucker in pool. All right wants to come and play minnesota fats minnesota fats is jackie
*  Yeah, please. Yeah, and he's amazing and he's so amazing. He's got two flowers on his jacket, bro
*  That's a the other one is a tie or a hanky rather. I didn't realize paul newman had multiple pool movies
*  Well, this was the original and so what the color of money with tom cruise was was fast eddie who was again paul newman
*  Getting back into the world of pool because the end of this movie spoiler alerts from the 1960s he retires
*  He's in this movie. He retires so he comes back. It's the same character. Okay. All right
*  Yeah, i've seen color of money
*  Yeah, i've seen color of money, but you know you're picking him up again now and he's 60. That's hilarious
*  Yeah, so this young kid is talking shit and he doesn't understand that because he's a really hot pool player today
*  But he doesn't understand that this guy in front of him is a legend. Yeah
*  I remember the name of his willy moscone was the bala buschka. Yeah, well exactly
*  All right
*  Yeah bala buschka was the type of cue that he had in those because of this movie
*  This movie in particular that because they didn't mention in the first movie
*  But it was pretty clear they were playing with the bala buschka this movie
*  That that fucking cue is worth a shitload of money now
*  Like there's a lot of like great pool cue manufacturers from that era
*  Like I know you like like crafts. I do totally in the world of pool. It's all about cues
*  It's all about like the the the type of hit you want the type of wood waiting
*  Yeah, and bala buschkas have a very specific kind of hits of her
*  It's like there's an old school feel to it that a lot of the players that have been playing like most of life love
*  Company still around no
*  No, no, no, if you're buying one now, you're playing it's gonna be a shitload of money, man
*  It's like at this point. It's an art piece. Would you play with it if you had some people do some people do
*  It's like a badge of honor, you know, you show up at a pool hall with a bow, but it's not necessarily the best playing
*  Yeah, it's like that's like gun like shotguns
*  You know what I mean? You get the art pieces and the the vintagey stuff. There's one right there for 22 000 22
*  Moving on that
*  Let me see what that looks like. Yeah, that looks that and is that a oh, that's got the string on it
*  So that was the original cortland wrap and all that those inlays that's mother of pearl
*  Yeah, that was all done by ivory down in the bottom, right? No, I don't think so
*  I think that's this uh, there's a type of uh, that might be ivory actually if it's old enough
*  That's probably might be ivory. It might be ivory. You might be right 22 g
*  They would use a plastic down there because he wanted something to be durable
*  Yeah
*  Bouncing on the ground or whatever and they all used um ivory that came from the the pre-ban days
*  Because back then when they were making these things people could go over there and shoot elephants just for their tusks
*  What does that say ebony ebony points?
*  What's it saying?
*  uh
*  ebony
*  Gold bands racetrack mop
*  What is that?
*  Nameplate, okay racetrack mop nameplate. That's blank between. I don't know you lost me
*  But that's pretty cool between the mop dots and the diamonds original cortland mat mostly falling off two original
*  george balbuska shafts
*  Unusual that's a person's name. Oh, yeah
*  Well, they've had a bunch of those like that where people would buy them they would order them and he would engrave their name in it
*  Yeah, yeah, it sounds like a very shotgun like thing shotguns are similar like that. Yeah
*  Like a lot of character and the wood you have to go you go over there and you choose your wood and
*  Scroll work and the barrel work and all that crazy shit a good friend of mine makes pool cues is
*  Um, they're called sugar tree. Uh, his name is eric crisp. He makes them all by hand. I'll show it to you afterwards
*  I'll let you show you like a dozen of them out here, right?
*  It's his his the way he makes things is like super specific like he's like a
*  He's an art connoisseur if wood was an art
*  So like when he looks at like a piece of wood he he doesn't think it's like a combination of knowing
*  It'll make a good pool cue but also wanting it to look a specific way
*  But they have all these gnarly knots in them weird kind of colors of the woods and just finds with interesting grain
*  It's like oh, it's just like guns. Yeah, it's the same thing. What does it say?
*  Balbuska pool cues were reintroduced in the 1980s with the permission. Yeah, but that's not real
*  Yeah, once the movie came out someone asked if they could license it. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's what it's what happened was there was a company this it's a good it's a decent cue
*  But it's not like uh, you know, it's a real it's like a shelby cobra, right?
*  You can buy a replica cobra, but the real one is the real one like the way that one plays better
*  I mean there's people that like the way all kinds of different things play it might play better than there
*  But it's not you call it a balbuska balbuska gotta make it. Yeah, he's got people he's not alive
*  Same thing cobras, you know that you could you uh, um brand new replica shelby cobra
*  Will probably drive a lot better than the ones they were racing at lemont in the 60s
*  But one is 50 grand and one is a million. Yeah, one is real
*  And to be honest that wouldn't mean I wouldn't buy one of those newer balbuskas either if I wanted a cue to play with
*  No, they all play good. As long as you know what you're getting. It's fine. Yeah
*  The thing with cues is like with a lot of things. It's like you when if you see a pool cue
*  Like it doesn't even necessarily have to be
*  A
*  Anything fancy?
*  It's just you see like the oh with if it's got nice wood and nice balance to it and you can look at this
*  Like yeah, you look at it, you know, somebody's made that by hand most likely somebody
*  crafted that on a lathe and with watches too, you know the the difference between a
*  $500 watch and a $5,000 watch and a $50,000 watch and a $500,000 watch
*  Is just further and further into the details that one watch that was good for 400 years
*  Bananas, yes, there's and there's other ones like that. I have a hard time with that. Yeah, i'm having a crazy math machines
*  I love I love the crazy math machines. There's watches that play chimes
*  There's watches that where you you you hit a button and like a thing like dances like a cuckoo clock
*  There's like all kinds of crazy shit people do. Yeah, there's a whole genre of porno watches
*  have you seen the porno watches where it's literally you hit a button and
*  people like start banging in front of you like on the
*  Yeah, no, I mean like a hologram. Yeah. No, no like a mechanical
*  animatronic
*  Couple starts fucking on the dial. Oh, well, that's it's kind of hilarious
*  But it's an entire genre of watches and they're very very expensive very hard to google that
*  What's that one I saw this one guy had one that was like a dome and inside his own planet. Yeah
*  That's called the jacob
*  Astronomia and so anybody who wears that like you got to be some there are a million dollars
*  You gotta be some kind of pimp to have a planetarium on your forearm. So do you remember jacob the jeweler?
*  That's him. This is us. This is the universe. You can't wear one of those and have people look at you
*  Without you be you're being
*  a little crazy
*  so the astronomy
*  It's it's like a fishbowl you put on your fucking wrist
*  It's the weirdest thing ever and it's designed so that's the mechanism that rotates around the fishbowl
*  And it's got something called the thing that's flipping about is called a torbjorn and that is the time
*  regulating mechanism
*  And the mainspring which keeps it wound and then as you can see the actual clock itself
*  Rotates and stays vertical and then you've got this earth thing and then you've got this this big diamond that spin around
*  And it's it's a huge thing you wear on your wrist
*  It's probably 48 or 49 millimeters and it's it's like putting a fishbowl on your wrist
*  Because it's got a big glass like case over it. That is so crazy. So that's yeah
*  That's what one looks like in person. That is so crazy. Look at it. That's a million dollars
*  You got a million dollar fishbowl. Oh, so this one he's showing is the roulette wheel one
*  No, it's got a roulette wheel in it. Oh, that actually works
*  Oh my god, you wind it up and it sends a ball and you actually can play roulette on the watch. That's
*  That's called the astronomia casino. Yeah batshit, right?
*  Imagine you lose your house now. Look, this one's an animated one. It's an oil derrick that pumps
*  Oh, so when they spin it like i'm sure he'll show it but look, yeah the oil derrick
*  So did somebody design this because they owned an oil company certain that that is what had it made. Yeah. Oh my god
*  That's amazing. Yeah, how much you think it cost me? That's probably a million dollars. Of course it is
*  It's gross too. I wouldn't even want to touch. No, it's not
*  As you don't want to wear something like that. No, it's like you about it. Why are you getting it?
*  That's crazy. I don't know why I wouldn't get it. But like
*  If you
*  I don't know why you'd get it. You'd have to really appreciate the art of it. Look at what the fuck is going on there
*  Oh, it's a moon man floating. It's cool moon man. That does look gorgeous. It does look that is floating
*  I mean that you know, there's another company called mbnf
*  which is not as
*  um
*  kind of
*  Dumb for lack of a better word. It's less just a little less flashy and it looks like a fucking rocketeer
*  Trekkie space communicator, but it's all
*  Mechanical it's called mb and uh and percent f and um
*  They come out like people are doing some real creative shit joe. Oh, they really are like that's the kind of shit
*  That made ten gazincy move to the woods become the unibomb. He knew where all this is going
*  People can't leave anything alone. They they they have to innovate on everything. Well, it's kind of okay
*  Is it really okay? It's that it's look it makes our life way more interesting
*  But uh, there's worse things than innovating in a mechanical timepiece. Oh, no, it's amazing
*  So that this is this is mbnf
*  This is where these those two domes sort of spin around they make a couple different like crazy ones
*  But god that's beautiful. Yeah, so they have these sort of real spacey kind of alien device type watches
*  They're I mean, they're very expensive, but they're very that is 40 g's. Let me see that again
*  That's so pretty the one with the four is really crazy too. What is that?
*  Yeah, just so you can see on the left is the hour and the right is the minute
*  That's like a scale an old-timey scale at grandpa's house that one. This is my jam. That's the that's the space jam right there
*  Is that it's just crazy fucking watchmaking dude. Is that yeah, it's space machines back that up the one
*  Uh, what is that? What so that one?
*  The that you see the bottom left have a phone if you want to know the time
*  Yeah, this shit ain't for telling the time bro. This is for telling everybody that you run shit
*  That is that is the craziest thing to have on your body, right? You got a house on your body
*  So in this one this one the entire clock moves around the diamond course it does. Yeah, why wouldn't it why wouldn't it?
*  Of course it does spin bitch. I mean, you know, it's it's all real crazy. The round one is very cool
*  That was the concentric one. Yeah as the clocks look at that
*  It looks like a ufo that one on the right hand side that you just had that you just had jammy
*  What is that this no, no the one the blue one. Sorry blue one that you just had. Yeah, so that's concentric rings
*  Um is that it's the rings are concentric. So you see the line on the bottom so it's
*  552 is the time there or 452. Excuse me
*  What is in the center is that a squirrel in the center is the torbjorn? That's the the mechanism that powers it
*  There's other watches. Have you ever heard of an hyt watch? No
*  Hyt watches are fucking nuts because they're like they're powered by bellows and liquid so they tell the time
*  Yeah, give me one where you can see some of the liquid so much. I didn't study this shit. Wait
*  That's not a good picture. Jamie one. What are you talking about? Stop? That's a good one
*  No, no bottom left. I want to show the liquid specifically so that one right there that yeah, we did this
*  So yeah, yeah
*  So the liquid fills up and moves around the face as the time goes and these bellows move
*  So you see the bellows in the middle there?
*  It's pumping the liquid around the fucking clock feel like you've shown this to me before
*  That one seemed familiar when I said yeah, yeah the liquid ones so those are like 40 50 60 thousand dollars
*  It gets real starts getting real crazy. That's amazing
*  That's such crazy balling that skull 72 g's that skull one's pretty goddamn dope
*  If I was actual rose is sponsored by this company, of course he is
*  If I was an angry rock and roll guy perfect not saying that axel is but you know, you got angry style
*  That's the perfect thing. Yep. Yep. I mean you wouldn't recommend it to james taylor
*  I
*  Like
*  You know i'm saying yeah, I know some people couldn't like takes a certain type. Yeah
*  But if you wanted to get into some really next level weirdness, that's a good. That's a good way to do
*  What is that? What's that box?
*  What the fuck is that the pfps2 wrist drive scuba pro? That's a uh, that's a dive computer. Oh
*  Scuba diving computer
*  Oh, yeah that that that one right there is the nbnf legacy machine perpetual
*  So this round one right one to the right jimmy that diving makes me feel the same as reverse alex honnold
*  That's what diving makes me feel the same. I'm like get up get up
*  This one does the uh, the same shit as the first one I showed you it counts the date and stuff for like 400 years
*  But it just does it in a prettier crazier way. Oh my god. That's so beautiful. Yeah, that's see
*  This is what i'm fascinated by that somebody in some group of people obviously it's not like one wizard
*  And they're doing it at multiple companies all around the world
*  Yeah, and they're innovating and they're competing with each other to make cooler and weirder shit
*  Yeah, and all this stuff is like I guess it's a watch but it's way more than just a watch like that thing up
*  Sorry, jimmy go back to that one. That was uh, that weird, uh spaceship one that was
*  Yeah, the the one in the top right there right there right there that one like space communicator watch that is so crazy
*  Yeah, yeah that thing yeah, that's not really a watch this one's cool, it's mechanical but it's it's but you read it from the side
*  Like that. It's very very space communicator. Yeah, it's cool. It's something different. It's something what it's like
*  It's like the night. It's like that singer dls, right?
*  They take this old the old way and they evolve the old way as far as they can
*  So these watches have amazing materials like really interesting alloys they make for stuff
*  They a lot of these companies make their own alloys
*  Which is really interesting. Look at this thing. So cool. What is that?
*  It's like a it looks like what we thought a spaceship was gonna look like in the 1950s
*  Yeah, and it's a watch. Yeah, doesn't that kind of looks at its power? Yeah, it's like the movie the rocketeer
*  It reminds me of the rocketeers rocket. Yes. Yes. Yes
*  It's totally like that. Yeah
*  Oh my like, you know how elon's only seen space balls like this dude's only seen the rocketeer
*  God that's so beautiful. Yeah, so this shit's incredible dude
*  I mean if you most people will think you're a weirdo for wearing it
*  But if you wore something like this to like a watch nerds gathering
*  Oh my god, they'll think you're the king of the universe you walk in something like this
*  I'm going to a watch nerd gathering. Yes. Are you there's a grand seiko party. They announced the new watch
*  Ah, there's a godzilla watch a godzilla watch
*  Which I don't really like car
*  watch
*  Co-brands, I think the connection is obvious enough. You don't need to shove it in my face
*  But i'm still going to go to the party. It's a car watch co-brand godzilla is the nissan gtr
*  Not the movie monster. So it's a cross branding with the nissan gtr and oh
*  I got confused. I thought it was like an anniversary thing for godzilla
*  I think it's the nissan gtr. Oh, so that godzilla that godzilla. Oh
*  Well, it looks dope it does look dope. Oh wait, it might actually be the movie godzilla
*  Maybe it is this fucking 65th anniversary. They came out with a gtr watch like months ago. So maybe I just got confused
*  You did I remember the gtr watch was like a chronograph. Yeah. Yeah, it's like a bunch of different little
*  Yeah, that's what I get for not doing my homework. I guess it is the movie monster anniversary my bad
*  It looks like it's uh, like a dinosaur skin. Yeah, the leather skin. Yeah, there's see that one gtr
*  50th that was like a couple months ago. So sorry their manufact. I mean their finish quality is amazing
*  Let me see that godzilla thing again. Did you do the thing? I told you about the reflections on the back of the hands
*  Not so grand seiko. Believe it
*  They're finishing on the back of the hands as good as the finishing on the front of the hands
*  And if you reflect a light certainly certain ways you can get it to reflect on the dial. It's really cool
*  I think it looks wicked. Yeah, they make a nice watch. Well, they have really pretty design
*  Whoever is designing their stuff it's very that's a weird thing about like watches or anything that someone makes it's like what what?
*  Appeals to the eye like that that tgt studios clock see that thing right this thing like that's awesome
*  Yeah, it's something it appeals to the eye
*  It's an a piece of art that also tells you the time but there's something about it like the way it's shaped the way it's formed
*  Yeah, it makes you want to look at it. It's interesting. Well, the really the very best watches
*  Yeah, you just stare at them sometimes like your watch I love is your spring drive
*  Yeah, yeah, so the spring drive with the super smooth
*  You don't need to wear be diving to wear a dive. I gotta dive. You never know shit. It's the fan
*  I want a waterproof watch
*  No, you just get you get your shit wet all the time probably right between the tanks and the sweating and the washing your hands
*  And whatever it's definitely gonna get wet occasionally. Yeah, I mean it's a dive watch isn't for people who dive
*  It's for people who just get their hands wet. Tell that to a diver
*  They want to piss in your mouth right now. Fuck you bro. I'm a diver. I'm a scuba diving instructor
*  Are you really? Yeah, you teach people I can I did in my early 20s. Well, then you gave me now I do this
*  What's uh, it's you gave me a diver pass. Yeah, I'm good. Shazam
*  I absolve you dude. I'm terrified of the ocean. Why getting in that water with all those fucking things?
*  I'm better than you
*  Yeah, but most of them don't care about you most of them. You just looking at them key word in there. Yeah, most of them
*  I did I went to the Galapagos over this year and I didn't saw hammerhead sharks while snorkeling was rad
*  Nothing cuter than a baby hammerhead like this big really amazing like a foot long. It was the cutest thing ever but like
*  Yeah, I can see how the ocean is big and dark and scary dude. It's terrifying
*  Yeah, I know I get I still get a little nervous when I go in the ocean. You should be
*  I can't move good
*  Monsters in there. They're real. I know this is what I always say about sharks
*  If there was a werewolf
*  And the werewolf came out every full moon
*  Every full moon if you were outside your house, you got murdered
*  You just got ripped apart and it happened to one person every full moon all across the land
*  Yeah, people would be like fuck man. I'm not going out with a full moon
*  Okay
*  Sharks are like werewolves, but they're werewolves every day of the year
*  I don't I don't think shark attacks are that common because they don't they don't see you and you're not supposed to be there
*  So they're not accustomed to you if they were accustomed to you
*  Like if we lived in the water with sharks, do you think the moral?
*  Duty that sharks have to be good neighbors who keep them from eating us if we were like
*  Just everywhere in the water all the time and sharks figured it out. They'd be like, oh we could just eat them
*  Let's just eat them. They just they're just dumb. They don't know they're supposed to eat us
*  They have a narrow thing in their eye of what they're supposed to be eating. Yeah, they don't I don't think they like us
*  I don't think they want to eat us. They're just not accustomed to it. Yeah, their their focus is look
*  Don't when they bite people don't they spit them out a lot? They rarely finish a human you see them
*  They take a limb. They don't finish a human. I saw jaws, dude in jaws
*  They finish people and there was also like fucking license plates and shit. Remember? Oh, yeah, they eat trash
*  Yeah, yeah, they'll eat your asshole they eat everything. Yeah, but they probably wouldn't eat two license plates in a row
*  They might I don't think they think I think they're just eating machines
*  There's no I don't calculate any better, but I don't think there's any evidence that sharks are like wizards
*  They're really smart and clever like dolphins are clever as fuck orcas are good
*  We know sharks just these murderers just with a continual row of teeth
*  Yeah, the teeth fall out new one pops in bang like a rotor, but I don't go diving where there's fucking
*  They can just decide to go to your neighborhood
*  it's like you were you were camping fuck up and a giant in a way and
*  Out there in that campground wolves were tearing open fucking tents and pulling people out eating them alive
*  Would you feel like well, you know, they don't they never come up here
*  They're literally chumming that shark they're feeding that shark to that image. It's a real thing dude. They brought in a werewolf
*  This is what I'm saying
*  look if you had a fucking cage and it could put you in the middle of the woods and
*  Your friend ties a lamb to the outside of the cage so you can see the werewolf in real life
*  And it looks like American werewolf in London. That's that I know that's the fucking shark diving
*  What do you want from me? Yeah the ocean. I've just please do me a favor. I like the ocean look at those teeth
*  So scared for you, you know, I go what about Joe don't you go walk? What about mountain lions you go walking?
*  I'm trying to pretend that I'd be able to stab some mountain lion and get it off of me
*  I died for the knife my dog would try to make friends with the mountain lion
*  He's so nice
*  You know what he barks at hilarious. The only thing he barks at is what barks at when people have a Santa Claus on their driveway
*  What the fuck is that
*  He's never seen you know, he doesn't know what the fuck they are right?
*  He doesn't see there's a normal thing for him to see glowing
*  We're walking and I take him to the trail and I open up the back to let him out he jumps out
*  Onto the sidewalk and looks at this guy's fucking this guy's fake snowman and starts barking. Oh my
*  They just goes. Oh my god. I'm an idiot
*  He realizes it's just some fucking thing that's not really a person and then he just runs up the hill
*  I got kittens a couple months ago and one of them
*  Didn't just learned that he was fighting himself in the mirror
*  Really fun 20 minutes to figure that out and they chase their own tail is genuinely hilarious
*  Yeah, there's something about watching the kitten just spin around their own tail. They're dumb as fuck, but they're so fun
*  It's such a little drug it's so enjoy inducing to watch a kitten just spin around
*  Oh, dude, I don't watch TV
*  I have four cats in my house and all I do is like what are the cats doing and just watch one other cats
*  Are doing it said it's constantly entertaining
*  Do you know this the video with the cat and the two crows or the cat these two cat or the?
*  Excuse me the crow and the two cats where this crow instigates a fight between these two cats
*  No
*  Lands on the roof like real close to a cat
*  He's like what and the cat like moves out of me flies away real quick and he comes back and then he flies over
*  To the other roof goes to another. Oh, this is a different one where they're doing it
*  And he starts and he causes the two cats to fight each other. He's amazing
*  They fuck with the cats and they get him close to each other and watch them fight. It's like a dog king of birds
*  Yes, they do it all the time. They like doing it that instigate. Oh funny
*  So there's this one they literally pick on them and get them worked up so they'll fuck up the other cat, bro
*  That's so fun with these cats were on the roof. They were on this. This is probably a hundred of these videos
*  They're really clever
*  You've seen like the videos of what you're talking about. It's just not coming up
*  You've seen the videos of crows is it crows or ravens that can use tools?
*  they can use tools
*  Wait, can I ask a question?
*  This is a really interesting topic but what is the legal thing with playing a clip from YouTube on this podcast?
*  We can't nobody's looking at that. They're seeing us. We can't use that's why
*  Because it's all right, though. You can't use other people shit. They'll take you down
*  I completely understand but in in my show I sometimes show images in the feed and so I was wondering
*  Will try to claim images like I'll give websites credit. I want to promote the website
*  Yeah, but if you have like someone else's stuff on your feed crows using compound tools, what is a compound tool?
*  Like took two things and made it a better tool. Oh shit really
*  Dude they were fucked they figured out at one point in time how to take one tool and use it to get a second tool
*  That was bigger and use that second tool to get food
*  So they figured out using a tool to get a tool
*  Yeah, use a tool but now they're figuring out how to make tools bitch
*  Connecting things together son. That's bonkers. They're smart and we did we started that too monkeys back in the day
*  We you know, we figured out a compound tool as much as I love cats
*  Those little fuckers are sneaky the pick fights I have I had a cat that could open doors
*  Which was it which was just yeah, we ever getting it on and the cat jumped in
*  This is the one this is the one so they get it off go right to the beginning because in the beginning you see
*  That no the beginning the crows on the roof with him fucking with them. See the very beginning of it. It's okay
*  No, that's how I could just play it from there. So the crows see how the crow takes off
*  Yeah, so he was fucking with them and then he flies over to the other one. Let's see and he goes what's up, bitch
*  What are you gonna let this fucking pussy hang out over here on this?
*  This roof right next to you
*  And he starts like getting close to him and rile him up and flying away when the cat gets close
*  And then he goes back again to the other cat and fucks with him
*  He gets some riled up and then he flies away and he goes back to the other cat and he flies away
*  And he keeps doing it until they just they're on edge cuz he's a little cut. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, that's so smart and then the cats are looking at each other
*  Yeah, so he starts fucking with the cats now the cats get more and more angry like he's starting that's so
*  He's actually pushing the cat towards other. Yeah. Holy shit. That's crazy. He made that
*  Like yeah, oh my god fall off the fucking roof the bird
*  In the snow bro. This bird is having a good time. That bird is evil
*  Evil that bird is having his own kitty cat fights to the death. Oh, oh my god
*  Look at these guys going down the hole. Oh shit, bro. You should just be commentating this shit
*  This is a fucking crazy
*  Is awesome my cat Conrad my 15 year old boy chased the fucking stray out of our yard yesterday like a boss
*  Cats are sneaky man. They're smart little fuckers and they carry some creepy diseases
*  Maybe they're paying him back for killing all their friends could be right eight million birds a year. Yeah. Oh Billy
*  Oh, dude, my cats are dealing some birds up. Yeah. Well, they said that they didn't have any idea
*  I remember what the number was. I don't excuse me
*  I don't remember what the number was but it's in the billions and they were stunned
*  They had no idea they ran some sort of a scientific study and using the study they examined all of them good, dude
*  All of us is really good at weed
*  Turns out I flashed this up. You didn't this was a taken in Northridge a week ago
*  What is that a mountain lion on someone's fucking hell?
*  Two of them but Northridge two on the roof at the same time. Oh my god, so how'd your kids hide your wife?
*  Yeah, well, they're looking for dogs and cats one of things
*  They found out when they killed them in San Francisco in the Bay Area
*  They have real problems up there sometimes
*  especially some of those homes that like
*  Like sort of like like we have Malibu with the mountain lions live real close proximity with the people
*  So they do these stomach examinations they find it's like half dogs and cats
*  Well the cat that I said that could open doors and shit. He wanted nothing more than to kill one of my other cats
*  He was a Russian blue had three legs and he was really really smart
*  We adopted him and we tried for like six months to make it work
*  We tried everything everything you could think of to make brought a criminal into your home
*  Exactly, and I didn't know and we had to we rehomed him with my brother-in-law and his wife and he like got along with
*  The dog it was having the best time and chill but he thought he fucking ran shit
*  He thought he owned the neighborhood and he ended up getting eaten by a mountain lion
*  Yeah, yeah three legs versus a mountain lion. All right Morgan
*  Smartest fastest three-legged animal you've ever seen but fucking
*  Yeah, and mountain lion one maybe he's a little cocky for his own good thousand percent he thought he ran shit
*  That's hilarious
*  The moment when you realize that that's a giant you
*  Do you think you're this bad motherfucker?
*  Cuz you get jacked most animals and then you realize oh my god, this is a hundred and four. Yeah me. Yeah
*  Was never seen again, but we're so weird that we let those things just wander around us. We're so weird
*  I always think it's really strange that I live with another species in my house. I think about that very often
*  I mean mountain lion. Oh, yeah, it's supposed to what like exterminate all the costing them all of them genocide
*  I don't I don't advocate. I don't think the vegan is wrong would that advocate that I don't think we should kill them
*  All I'm saying is it's really interesting that we have this thing that we sort of agree
*  Rarely rarely kills people but it does sometimes and we want to keep it around
*  Sounds an awful lot like the sharks bro. And we also have
*  That they're running out of shit to eat, you know
*  We're gonna have a thing listen man. Well the last time you saw a deer I
*  mean
*  Fairly recently but but but not often not here. It's pretty rare. Yeah, even if you live where deer are
*  Like I used to growing up in the suburbs of New York. I used to see deer like daily
*  Do you think deer on the pill?
*  Lived in a city and I haven't paid attention to the deer in the suburbs. I'll tell you what's what's happened man cats
*  Oh, they've moved in and started jacking deer and coyotes moved in start jacking deer and cats are fucking up deer big cats
*  Bobcats are fucking up deer. Oh, everybody's fucking up the fawns. Everybody's fucking babies
*  Yeah, so when the babies are born they have zero chance these big fucking big wild dogs
*  It's a coyotes that everywhere just California just like outside of LA
*  Mostly around us if you go to like Iowa they they have too many deer like you'll be driving
*  Why are we hunting deer not mountain lion?
*  Well, you can't hunt mountain lion in California. They don't have is there a pretty predatory cat that you
*  Can't know you should hunt. I mean, I don't know you can give that
*  Well, see the thing is like the the people think that you need to control their population
*  This is where the argument is it gets real interesting because it branches off between people that are
*  very much animal advocates animal rights first they want animals to to rule and
*  Be able to have their own freedom on their land
*  Yeah
*  And just whatever happens happens like mountain lions killing deer and all that kind of stuff and let it all take place and we shouldn't
*  Interfere with that and we shouldn't hunt there's people that really think like that and you know
*  they have their arguments and they have their the reasons but
*  The reality of animals is if you have large predators and the large predators runs out of things to eat
*  It's either going to go further and enter into new areas looking for food and it might get hit by cars
*  or it's gonna branch out and
*  Expand it's gonna expand its range and in
*  Expanding its range. It's gonna find a farm or it's gonna find a dog in the backyard
*  It's gonna find something because it's just trying to get food and like how many of those are we willing to have around us?
*  Yeah, like I'm not saying that we should kill mountain lions. I think it's wonderful. They're endangered. No, not really
*  So why can't we?
*  Okay, well California doesn't yeah
*  The only time California kills them really is when they get what's called a depredation order
*  Like if someone has something happen, like if you run a farm and a mountain lion starts killing your livestock
*  Which does happen a lady in Malibu a few years back had a I think it was an alpaca farm
*  And this fucking mountain lion killed like a ton of them. It was just killing them. They seem easy to kill though
*  I think it killed a goat too. I think it was just getting a kick out of killing things, you know
*  It was just fun and but they said it wasn't even eating him which is really nuts. That's strange
*  I think he couldn't get it out, you know
*  It's probably a really big animal and he couldn't get it out
*  He probably didn't feel comfortable enough to eat it while he's in there. So he's probably really he killed them all at once
*  Oh shit. Well, I think it was over a couple of days, but it was kind of a killing spree see the bullet pull up
*  Man just killed for fun
*  First of all when you think about Malibu, do you really think about an alpaca farm? No. Well, no, I think of that in Topanga
*  And if you did think about what I just drove here by the way over Topanga
*  Yes, someone it seems is building a house. That's like a dome that they're gonna put dirt over
*  Did you see this? It's up at the top of the hill at Topanga facing the beach and yeah, like okay
*  So picture a facade a flat facade with a bunch of windows brick
*  Right and then it just kind of ends and then there's this concrete
*  kind of three-quarter dome that comes out from behind it and
*  They're covering when I drove by they were covering the dome with this sort of
*  tarpy waterproofing layer and it looked like they were going to then
*  Move earth and and build a mountain over the dome
*  Your home would be sort of inside this man-made mountain fucking hobbit house it seemed
*  What if somebody offroads on your roof and it crushes your house? Oh, you know, that could be a problem suck in seven sues
*  You know, I live underground. What are you a rat? I don't know it seemed weird, but it was very interesting
*  It seems like fire resistant if the whole neighborhood catches on fire go for bro
*  Why he lifted underground to live in the air?
*  Underground or underwater Oh underground for sure. He's right. He's right. No, so that's a geodesic dome
*  This is sort of it's a flat
*  Whoever lives it's not it's not built yet
*  It's like half built but that's pretty fucking cool. Go back to that picture. Whoever lives in there for sure believes in chanting
*  Yeah, they call the corners regularly. It is how pretty it is
*  I mean, but the idea of living in a fun shape like that is yeah
*  Maybe would cool make your life more interesting for sure. If only I lived in a dome everybody would like me
*  But do you how long do you think you could live like that?
*  I don't some weirdo fucking art house before you like let me just have a house house like you don't need
*  You want to sit in a house house? There's an art house right near me. That's a very famous architects
*  I think it's Frank Gary's art house and it's a terrible use of space, but it literally has
*  Like a tree house like a box on a post
*  Just floating above the house and there's like a little stairs that go up there and there's just a dining room table for two
*  In the air on a post that's bonkers. It doesn't seem particularly
*  Christ but sometimes you're into those, you know, you got to have that designer house
*  Yeah, what if it got hit by an asteroid like that one little so I got a direct shot
*  Well, the luck the luck would be unbelievable
*  God telling you get the fuck out of here
*  Shouldn't have bought an art house get the fuck out of here with your art house, bro
*  I'm approaching my my P limit. Okay, three and a half. Well, we're at 630. We could wrap this bad boy up bring it home
*  I'm really proud of myself for not peeing during the show. It was a goal
*  And I did three bottles of fucking water. I was worried. I had a pee before the show twice respect respect
*  Man always a good time. I really like geeking out with you. It's been very fun. Tell everybody website Twitter
