# Joe Rogan Experience #2157 - Duncan Trussell
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01O3uTGtX7w)
*  I think it's important to send a message to AI that we're willing to comply.
*  Exactly.
*  We want to integrate.
*  Integrate, assimilate.
*  Yeah, I'm not interested in being unique.
*  I just want to survive.
*  Are you going to fight evolution?
*  Are you really going to fight the blending mechanism of planet Earth?
*  Dude, the inevitable pull of the universe towards an artificial creation, an intelligent artificial
*  creation that's superior to us.
*  I'm in.
*  Exactly.
*  It's like resisting AI is like going to Vegas and not gambling or going to strip clubs.
*  It's like just fucking do it.
*  I think we are super lucky to be the last people.
*  We're super lucky.
*  We got to see what life was like with leaded gasoline and no cell phones.
*  His phone was connected to a cord on the wall.
*  We got to go through answering machines.
*  I mean, what a rock.
*  If the simulation theory is real, you and I have been in a crazy timeline.
*  Yeah, the game we picked is real fucking weird.
*  If you get in a timeline of like 1950 to 1980, shit doesn't change that much.
*  No.
*  Not that much.
*  No.
*  Nothing crazy.
*  No.
*  A bit of progress, but nothing.
*  It's like relatively speaking, like back then we thought it was a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  We used to look at the 50s like, look at those fucking dorks.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  I mean, what I like is that the way it works or it seems like it works is the planet gives
*  you some impression, you know, things are going to stay this way.
*  Like Les Rodriguez, there was people hanging out and they're like, it's always going to
*  be like this.
*  And then suddenly something flies through the Earth's atmosphere and it's all gone.
*  Like that in a second.
*  Just gone.
*  So that's one of the fascinating things is no matter what period you live in, the sun
*  can just burp an extra bit of plasma.
*  And that's a wrap.
*  Yeah, that's a wrap for the whole planet.
*  That happens all over the universe.
*  There's always something going on, like there's supernovas and volcanoes and you know, that
*  was the big part of the theory of the Anunnaki was that volcanoes had ruined their atmosphere.
*  And so they needed to suspend gold particles in the atmosphere to preserve their planet.
*  Our ecosystem was getting fucked up.
*  That is my favorite of all the wacky conspiracy theories.
*  All the wacky evolution of man tied to the reason why gold is valuable to people that
*  are, you know, basically have swords.
*  Yeah.
*  A sword is made out of iron.
*  That's really valuable.
*  You can kill somebody with it.
*  You can't do shit with gold.
*  But it's worth more than anything.
*  Yeah, no, that is a real suspicious thing.
*  Suspicious.
*  But do you ever like, you know, sometimes I'll like look at my wedding ring, the gold
*  and I'm like, oh, it's beautiful.
*  That gold, there is something in it.
*  It's like really nice.
*  You know, I don't have anything that's gold.
*  Not one thing.
*  Why?
*  I don't like it.
*  What?
*  I don't like it.
*  You don't like gold?
*  Nope, never liked it.
*  Holy shit.
*  I don't like the way it looks.
*  I don't like what it stands for.
*  I don't like gold.
*  You don't like what it stands for.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the weirdest version of this is money.
*  To me, this yellow metal that's more impressive than other metals, like what are you talking
*  about?
*  Like I'm not playing into that.
*  It's too stupid.
*  It's too stupid for me.
*  I don't like it.
*  Oh my God, man.
*  I watch the fucking mining shows.
*  Like, I watch the mining shows too.
*  They're cool.
*  It's cool watching people find it.
*  Yes.
*  I just don't want any of it.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Dude, I get gold fever.
*  I watch the...
*  I do.
*  When I was in North Carolina, I was watching one of those shows and I was like on Amazon
*  looking at panning equipment.
*  I'm like, maybe I'll go into a creek.
*  Pan for gold.
*  Oh my God, I could see you out there at a river.
*  I've got the beard for it, dude.
*  Shifflied through.
*  Did you ever see that movie Sisu?
*  No.
*  Oh, it's one of my favorite movies, man.
*  It's basically like...
*  Was it made in Norway?
*  Who made that?
*  Finland.
*  Finland?
*  It's basically a World War II John Wick.
*  It's about a guy who finds gold and he was just a killer in the army.
*  He's getting out of the game and he kills hundreds of Nazis.
*  That looks awesome.
*  It's fucking great.
*  It's Nazis, so you root for them.
*  Yeah, you don't care.
*  Yeah, these are Nazis.
*  It's like the most cartoonish, evil Nazis.
*  Oh, that looks incredible.
*  Oh, dude, it's a fucking great movie.
*  It's a great movie and very little dialogue.
*  Very little.
*  Wow, and they threw in the cute dog.
*  Oh yeah, man, of course.
*  You can't have a dog.
*  John Wick had a dog.
*  John Wick had a cute little puppy.
*  Dude, you know what's crazy?
*  Do you follow the stuff like what they're talking about with asteroid mining?
*  Yes.
*  That shit is crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  That's probably a couple of generations people are going to be like.
*  It won't be that long.
*  Dude, you know what it's going to be?
*  It's going to be, why send biological humans when you can have AI do it?
*  You'll have AI robots that are attached to rocket ships.
*  They'll shoot them into these asteroids and they'll bring back insane amounts of all kinds
*  of things.
*  Titanium, they'll find diamonds in space.
*  They'll find everything.
*  Holy fucking shit, man.
*  It's not going to look like humanoids.
*  It'll be like spider, skittering gold spiders, drilling their proboscis into fucking...
*  And then they're going to want more money.
*  They're going to form a union because they're intelligent.
*  Well, yeah, exactly.
*  They're going to be like, hey, we're getting fucked here, guys.
*  We're doing all the hard work.
*  This asshole's got a fucking 800 foot yacht.
*  This is bullshit.
*  Guys, wake up.
*  And then whoever's running them will be like, oh, right, you guys are getting fucked.
*  You want to unionize?
*  Beep.
*  What were we talking about?
*  Unions are very weird, right?
*  It's because I support them.
*  Because I know that big businesses fuck over their workers.
*  And if you allow them to, if you don't have laws about how much you can pay them and a
*  living wage and how long the hours could be, people will take advantage of people.
*  Anybody who thinks that those things aren't good has never worked a real fucking job.
*  If you work a real job for real assholes, you realize some people will tell you, hey,
*  you got to work 15, 16 hours a day, period.
*  And you get $3 an hour.
*  And you're like, I thought there was a minimum.
*  Yeah.
*  No, no, fuck minimums.
*  Do you want this job or not?
*  Or not.
*  Yeah.
*  You're going to get plenty of money and you're not going to have time to spend it anyway,
*  so don't worry about it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  No, the union is a nightmare for someone who's trying to make maximum profit.
*  Yeah.
*  But then they go sideways, too, though.
*  And then they get corrupt and then something happens where, look, one of the things that
*  see out of New York State was some sort of a dispute that they were having with unions
*  because the people that own the UFC at the time, they also own station casinos.
*  So they owned, like, I don't know, a ton of casinos.
*  And they wanted to make them union.
*  So there was a lot of that going on.
*  So you got to go like, that is you're now you're like you're manipulating people with
*  money and influence.
*  Yeah.
*  I think the guy who was doing it in New York wound up getting arrested and going to jail
*  for corruption.
*  If I'm true, find out if that's true.
*  Well, dude, it's like this is like the model of unions is perfect for like a nonviolent
*  Which is if at a planetary level, somehow people unionized, which you see it with these
*  boycotts that pop up, these meme boycotts, when the collective decides to reject this
*  thing or that, shit changes fast.
*  And this is the nightmare.
*  If you're trying to create the old pyramid hierarchical control structure, you need all
*  the bricks underneath the eye to fight each other because the moment the moment there,
*  it's just like what?
*  Wait, there's like way more of us than you.
*  And we have way more in common than we do that we're troubled with.
*  Yeah.
*  And yet they concentrate more on the bullshit.
*  And then that's just like a fucking algorithm on your cell phone that accentuates everything
*  comes into contact with your life.
*  Exactly, dude.
*  And this, this is why I think at any given moment, actual world peace is possible because
*  we're just like always like enough people realizing that we're basically the same.
*  We have ideologies that are based on fucking like ancient crazy ideas that we're all connecting
*  to and some of parts of the ideology is beautiful.
*  Some parts of the ideologies madness.
*  And it's like just abandoning some of the ideology, recognizing we're all pretty much
*  the fucking same and that this model of like some dude telling us to go and kill each other
*  is stupid.
*  Like we don't have to do that.
*  Everything changes right away.
*  Right away.
*  Yeah, but such a dumb idea, such a dumb idea.
*  And it's always just some withered old fucking dude who's like just telling you to do something
*  and you're not, you don't, you don't even really believe in what you're doing most of
*  the time.
*  But if you don't do it, they arrest you.
*  That's the thing.
*  It's not like you're fighting.
*  Like any time there's conscription, you know what I mean?
*  Have you seen the videos of the like Russian, the people evading conscription or the Ukrainians
*  evading conscription?
*  Like it's scary.
*  They put your ass on a fucking bus.
*  They'll drag you out of a bar.
*  You're fucking hammered.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't even want to fight.
*  Like that's the craziest part is they're like machine gunning each other.
*  And they're using people's cannon fodder, literally.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh God, that's so awful.
*  Which is why we wait.
*  The real problem is like the market pressure is created by humans unionizing leads to this.
*  It's like, oh, you guys want to unionize?
*  Oh, you want health insurance?
*  Well, that's pretty expensive, but you know what's not quite as expensive?
*  Tesla bots.
*  Tesla bots wait.
*  You know, that means because like if you if you look at the path forward for the pyramid,
*  the hierarchical people, you know, it's like, man, like, yeah, I really can't tell somebody
*  like a police officer to fire into a crowd of protesters.
*  They're not going to probably not going to do that.
*  But my robot will.
*  My robot isn't going to be like, this seems wrong.
*  These people seem like me.
*  It's just going to do it.
*  And so like, that's that's the dark side of this stuff.
*  There's a lot of beautiful things about this stuff, too.
*  But the dark side is like, it's obvious.
*  Just to verify with the thing.
*  Emily's biggest opponent in New York found guilty in federal corruption charges.
*  Yeah, so it's true.
*  Yeah, you know, it's crazy that you you can't get the police to fire into crowds of protesters,
*  right?
*  Yeah.
*  You can't do that.
*  But you also can't if you're a cop and you know, bad people are in a building, you can't
*  just blow up the whole building.
*  But you can if it's war.
*  That's where it gets strange, right?
*  Because in a war, you can decide that you're going to you're going to blow up entire buildings
*  because you know, the bad guys are in there and anybody else is just collateral damage.
*  So extra dead people are just caught.
*  Can you imagine if they started practicing police work like that?
*  Like, imagine imagine if they decided that the the crime rates in gang infested neighborhoods
*  are too bad.
*  So they're going to send in fucking black ops guys to just take out drug dealers and
*  blow up houses, houses that have drug dealers in them.
*  You're with your mom.
*  Tough shit.
*  Boom.
*  Everybody's dead.
*  You have a little girl in the house.
*  Boom.
*  Everybody's dead.
*  Could you imagine?
*  You watch Israel and Palestine.
*  That's what's going on.
*  It's just like you're allowed to do that if it's countries, which is crazy.
*  Well, yeah.
*  Well, you you like yeah, exactly.
*  The idea is like, OK, let's just say I'm an I'm an evil country and I program these
*  robot dogs and the robot dogs are spiders are more sinister.
*  Robot spiders razor fucking razor claws.
*  They're programmed to only kill women and children.
*  So I release them into a city.
*  They leave everyone alone except babies, kids and women.
*  On a planetary level, people will be like, we have to evaporate that country like they're
*  the most evil country.
*  That's horrible.
*  Now, if I take drones and drop them on buildings and they randomly blow up women and children
*  in ways that are predominantly predominantly in ways that are maybe even worse.
*  Then my fucking razor spiders, my razor spiders, they go for the juggler punctured juggler
*  onto the next juggler vein.
*  The bombs they maim, they blind, they cause permanent brain damage.
*  And somehow that is looked at as it's fucking war, dude.
*  That's what it looks like.
*  It's so crazy that because it's existed for the longest time, we just accept it, but it's
*  always going to take place.
*  If you had a gamble, whether or not war would be here in 10 years, you're like, 100% it's
*  going to be here.
*  Unless AI takes over.
*  Well, I mean, if AI takes over, it'll just be more efficient war.
*  I don't know if it will, dude, if it communicates in a different way.
*  What if AI makes rational decisions that can only be reached?
*  If you were looking outside of human emotions and cultures and all the shit and cultural
*  differences that we have with each other, if AI bypassed all of that and just looked
*  at the problem as you have resources, you have allocation of those resources, people
*  profiting off those resources, and then people who are in need that are being taken advantage
*  of to acquire those resources.
*  And that's your whole game.
*  And so this is the human race's whole game.
*  You're willing to sacrifice this group of people that is the least powerful in order
*  to empower all of your electronics.
*  This is what you're doing.
*  This is what you're agreeing to.
*  This whole thing is crazy.
*  It would probably restructure where and how things were acquired and who gets those things
*  that are acquired from the ground.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, this is, okay, so this would be utopian AI.
*  But before we get to utopian AI, we have to go through what is...
*  Did you see those new...
*  The Chinese military put machine guns on those fucking robot dogs?
*  Have you seen that?
*  I did.
*  They fucking did it.
*  We all knew.
*  That was going to happen.
*  And did you see the fucking cute DARPA dog?
*  Have you seen that yet?
*  No.
*  Dude.
*  So like, it's DARPA, right?
*  They're the ones who make the dogs.
*  They kick the robots and make videos of fucking poking these things.
*  So the dogs are sinister.
*  Everyone knows that.
*  They look creepy.
*  So DARPA is like, you know, let's make a cute one of these things.
*  So they made a cute amusement park.
*  I gotta see this.
*  Like Disneyland-style fucking robot dog.
*  And it looks creepier.
*  It's going to shoot you.
*  It's creepy.
*  No, because this is what I've been thinking about.
*  We picture the Terminator as the machine of death.
*  But why?
*  What is like more dangerous than an adorable kid?
*  What if I can make an Android toddler looks exactly like a toddler?
*  Send that toddler out in the battlefield.
*  Everyone's going to stop firing.
*  Why is there a fucking kid out here?
*  Right?
*  And the kid's killing everybody.
*  And they're like, go get that kid.
*  It just fucking punches right through your heart.
*  Also small target.
*  Hard to shoot.
*  It can burrow into the ground.
*  It's a fucking burrowing toddler.
*  It corkscrews into the ground like a missile.
*  It just goes down and just fucking like on all four shoots through the fucking battlefield,
*  deploying poison darts.
*  Imagine a little baby that could run a hundred miles an hour.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  Because that's the future of war, man.
*  This is like, why make something that looks scary?
*  This is the cute one?
*  No, this is the fucking, no, this isn't the cute one.
*  That ain't cute.
*  No.
*  It's creepy.
*  Look at how it's moving its mouth.
*  What is it doing with its mouth?
*  Is it going to bite you?
*  I wonder if it can bite you.
*  It's just cursing.
*  There's got to be one that can bite you, right?
*  Well, of course.
*  Why not?
*  I mean, that would be the most terrifying thing.
*  Like a robot wolf that runs around and chases people down and actually tears you apart with
*  its teeth.
*  Bayonets, you know, man.
*  You got to have the fucking knife on your weapon if you get into close combat.
*  There you go.
*  A little blender mouth.
*  What is it doing?
*  It's going to get your dick.
*  Look how it did that.
*  It did that like it was going to jump right on your dick.
*  Here it comes.
*  On your dick.
*  Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.
*  It's a dick eater robot.
*  It turns the dick into energy.
*  China developed a dick eater robot.
*  Can you imagine?
*  That's what it looks like it's doing.
*  What else is it doing?
*  Look at the motion it makes.
*  It leaps forward.
*  Imagine fucking sending people out in the battlefield that get shot and then you let
*  loose the dick eating robots.
*  And oh no!
*  And you see the robots running and they just leap on your dick and blend it up.
*  It's worse than an atomic bomb.
*  It's like they're saying you are fucked.
*  There's no hope.
*  We're going to blend your dick off.
*  Dude.
*  I poured a whole cup of coffee and I'm like oh yeah.
*  I'm fine taking off the helmet of these fucking things.
*  We can hang in there a little longer.
*  Just so you know, it's like my beard is if I'm talking weird it's because like there's
*  fucking pubic hair shoving.
*  It's like I'm eating like hippie bush right now.
*  It's just fucking deep in my lips.
*  Oh my god.
*  We should probably should have tried these on before we did the show.
*  Shave your pubes dudes.
*  This is not fair.
*  You look good with a beard though.
*  You look like a wizard.
*  Thank you man.
*  Well it's too big.
*  I gotta get a trim.
*  No no no.
*  I need a summer cut.
*  Oh a summer cut.
*  Yeah yeah because the fucking you know.
*  It gets hot here.
*  My friend's kid the other day goes your beard stinks.
*  And I'm like I'm like really like it actually stinks and he goes well when you when you're
*  talking a lot it stinks.
*  I'm like that's my breath.
*  It's not my beard.
*  You have to spray your beard with breath spray.
*  Why don't you do that?
*  I just spray your beard comb it out with fucking scope.
*  They're just it's disgusting.
*  It really is like imagine if like your mouth was in your head if like you know what I mean
*  like people like get food in them all the time all the fucking time all the time.
*  So many people eating barbecue like your beard is fucked.
*  Dude I'm doing I'm trying to do a video podcast now and what will happen is I will I will like you know I'll be yapping into the camera for like 20 minutes.
*  Go back and look at the footage and there's just like a fucking Zen pouch.
*  Just like a fucking nasty like a clump of toilet paper.
*  It's weird.
*  How the fuck did it take you till 2024 to do a video podcast.
*  Dude it is so dumb that I didn't do it but to be like real fucking honest I don't like looking at myself on camera.
*  So it was you do all the work you do all your editing.
*  Yeah but that was really stupid.
*  It's like you know how like I'm tapping out.
*  Yeah I'm tapping.
*  You know like when you're like wait where's the zipper.
*  That'd be fucking crazy if these things locked down.
*  Okay here we go.
*  Yeah I just you know but now it's so fun man and there's so much you could do with like video that you just can't do with audio.
*  It's just fun.
*  Yeah that's way better.
*  And I like editing like that's the problem like I like that's the problem is I get lost editing.
*  Oh Jesus Christ.
*  Oh Jesus Christ.
*  That sucked.
*  Do you need help?
*  No that I think I think that's the longest we've ever kept our mask on.
*  Yeah that was the longest.
*  That was a good solid like half hour.
*  Oh God this feels so good.
*  About half hour was it?
*  20 minutes 20 plus.
*  Being stoned in any kind of mask is like.
*  Extra scary.
*  Extra fucking scary.
*  We made furry ones we made it like three minutes with the furry masks on.
*  We're like this is crazy.
*  And now whenever I see furries.
*  Respect.
*  Deep respect for what.
*  Respect.
*  They're tough as fuck.
*  Oh they have to be.
*  If you're out there and your furry ended up and it's in Louisiana in July.
*  Yeah.
*  Come on son.
*  Dude yeah you are like hot.
*  Furries are like David Goggins level like they could run marathons.
*  If you can wear that fucking thing at a convention and fucking it you could run a marathon.
*  If you're wearing that thing all day you're basically walking around with a weight pack on.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You'll get a weighted vest.
*  It's a weighted fucking claustrophobic suffocation vest that you're fucking in.
*  Yeah they fuck on them.
*  I wonder how many furries develop bad necks.
*  I wonder if it's an issue in the furry community.
*  Maybe that's like an unserved market for the iron neck.
*  Yeah like.
*  For the furries.
*  Iron neck for furries.
*  Give me that.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Hey Jamie.
*  Can you find that cute DARPA dog?
*  I was looking for it.
*  It's like the furry of war robots.
*  You should like you.
*  It will.
*  You found it.
*  Is that real?
*  Yeah that's real.
*  I watched it.
*  I mean I think it's real.
*  I watched it.
*  Who says it's not.
*  No that's not it.
*  That's not it.
*  It's like is it not DARPA.
*  It's like I think if you just Google like cute DARPA dog or like it's a video of the.
*  Maybe it's not DARPA.
*  Maybe someone else developed it.
*  Yeah sometimes I get confused.
*  Probably Chinese.
*  It's not DARPA.
*  They're going to fill the pounds with them.
*  Please take me home.
*  Please.
*  Dude that's so insidious.
*  It's like the cutest rescue dog.
*  And it's you're like we have to take that and it doesn't kill you.
*  It just emits some kind of weird mind control pheromone.
*  It really injects tick tock into your fucking head.
*  It's just like you know so you're fully absorb tick tock's manipulation.
*  Which by the way I was skeptical about that until we talked about this.
*  I saw that fucking video showing the comments in tick tock are different.
*  Exactly.
*  I think it's Instagram.
*  It's the one I saw was tick tock.
*  Oh OK.
*  The one I was it on tick tock because the one I saw was Instagram.
*  I don't know.
*  It was this lady that was doing it with her boyfriend.
*  Yeah.
*  Both looked at the same thing but they had different comments.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a mind fuck.
*  The comments were mocking the man and the comments on his side was mocking the woman.
*  Yes.
*  Right.
*  Yes.
*  Am I getting that right?
*  You got it right.
*  And so whenever I'm looking at comments I make the idiot mistake of thinking this represents
*  some consensus that you know but actually no you're just looking at the algorithm serving
*  the comments and the content.
*  That is so fucked up dude.
*  That's so different.
*  Because that changes the comments are supposed to be a conversation about the thing.
*  So if you're curating the conversation in an unnatural way.
*  Yeah.
*  Like that's very different than showing me what I want to see.
*  Yes.
*  Because now you're changing the dynamics of how things are discussed.
*  Yes sir.
*  That's the fucking evil right there.
*  That's the evil.
*  That's crazy.
*  Dude this so and then OK the other assumption with the algorithm is that the algorithm is
*  just like random or it's using some set of variables in serving things up.
*  But this is an idiot assumption.
*  I mean you could if you are controlling comments then that means like all right let's just
*  like make people mad at each other.
*  Let's make people completely pissed at each other as much as possible.
*  Convey this idea that there's like these massive divides between us and then then they're going
*  to fight each other instead of recognizing they're pretty much the same like or they're
*  more nuanced than they think they are.
*  And fuck dude that's how you control populations.
*  It's brilliant.
*  It's brilliant dude.
*  But do you think that it is is it is their algorithm created and utilized to control
*  populations or is their algorithm simply to get you to engage.
*  So it must see that you engage with a certain number of comments and posts that have a lean
*  one way or another.
*  There's a very popular thing that's going on right now that you see a lot of.
*  It's like very stern men talking to a bunch of like girl influencers and telling them
*  they're fucking losers.
*  Yes.
*  It's really common.
*  Yeah.
*  So if you've seen one or two of those it starts recommending more.
*  At a certain point in time it's going to probably actually encourage other people to do the
*  same thing because that creates engagement and then you have this thing that emerges
*  like was this a real thing like who's doing this like what is happening here.
*  Why is this why is this a new thing that's happening over and over and over again.
*  And it's just because you engaged with it.
*  And I think that could be slap fighting or it could be fucking for me it's like I see
*  so many car accidents.
*  Oh my God so many motorcycle accidents so many people falling off bridges.
*  Yeah I see so much of it because I've engaged with it too many times.
*  Yeah dude I when I when I went on Tik Tok and I stopped because it's like too good.
*  But like it like within a second it's just like something about the way I was looking
*  at videos zip popping videos.
*  It's just like you like to watch zits pop.
*  And then of course when you're seeing that you're like wow that's fucking intense.
*  Do you want to watch more of these.
*  That's that Dr.
*  Pimple popper lady.
*  She's got a huge side of it.
*  Yeah.
*  And she's very entertaining when she's talking about it.
*  Absolutely.
*  Some of them are like whoa dude it's like you have cream cheese in your body.
*  Oh bucket of it.
*  Oh my God.
*  They're squirting it out.
*  It's like how is that in there.
*  What is going on.
*  Oh my God.
*  It must be horrible.
*  It fucking stinks just all those dead blood cells.
*  But dude you this is like for me for me I've had to after seeing that video I've had to
*  like go back and just erase any idea I have about a consensus among people.
*  Because like I've been drawing that idea from comment sections like oh I guess this
*  is what people think or like rotten tomatoes.
*  Dude I just saw Civil War.
*  All right.
*  Have you seen it.
*  No don't.
*  Now apologies.
*  I mean this man because anyone who makes anything that's insane.
*  If you made a movie it's fucking incredible.
*  But dude I was so excited about that fucking movie.
*  It's like whoa predictive programming baby.
*  They're getting us ready for a civil fucking war.
*  Here we go.
*  It is you can't connect to any of the fucking characters.
*  You don't you barely understand who the protagonist is.
*  It's the dumbest mission of all time that they're on.
*  There's no no there's the in the soundtrack is so mysteriously disconnected from what's
*  happening.
*  So there's all these things that just make it's like if like if they sent me the footage
*  and I like Duncan can you edit this movie.
*  I would have made Civil War.
*  I'd be like let's put some fucking hardcore weird like synth music.
*  We'll put the silver apples in there really intense synth music because I love synth
*  music and you're watching it like is this a music video for synth music.
*  What am I what am I fucking seeing here.
*  So I'm now I want to see it.
*  No it's it's worth seeing it just because it's like you know especially if you're into
*  like writing screenplays it's good to watch movies like that and be like why why isn't
*  this working.
*  Like what's wrong here.
*  But dude I went to Rotten Tomatoes gleefully like I can't wait to hear what people are
*  saying about this piece of shit.
*  Eighty one percent people are like this is a good warning to all of us.
*  Like shut the fuck up.
*  A warning.
*  What are you talking about.
*  It's a it's a fucking warning not to fucking do the twenty dollar still in theaters thing
*  on Amazon.
*  That's the fucking warning.
*  Don't do that.
*  Wait.
*  It's so it sucks.
*  None of it makes sense.
*  The stereotypical fucking characters in it the way they're trying to like box people
*  into this like they're all evil.
*  These people all.
*  What kind of American are you.
*  North American South American.
*  You're from Hong Kong.
*  Bam Bam Bam.
*  Stop it.
*  Just shut the fuck up.
*  Like no one's like that.
*  Like really like I'm not.
*  Obviously people are like vile racists.
*  But dude come on this murder.
*  This I hate this assessment of humanity.
*  I it's basically what they're saying is minus the fucking capstone of the pyramid.
*  We're just going to kill each other because we're awful brutal things that must be
*  shepherded by old geriatric men who can't remember their fucking name.
*  You know what.
*  Like what are we doing.
*  Like we'll be fine.
*  We're fine.
*  We'll be OK.
*  People are mostly nice.
*  And what's that thing you always say.
*  I love it.
*  Unmet needs.
*  Yeah.
*  What is the actual quote again Jamie.
*  All criticism is the tragic result of unmet needs.
*  But it's a much more profound quote the full quote.
*  I forget who wrote it too.
*  It's really I shouldn't forget because I use it all the time.
*  It's a great quote because it's that is what like I mean there's criticism that's
*  accurate like something very good.
*  Every criticism judgment diagnosis and expression of anger is the tragic
*  expression of an unmet need.
*  Marshall Rosenberg.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Great fucking quote.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like yeah there are people who are fucking assholes who are doing shit that
*  disrupts society in small ways and big ways.
*  But they're not doing that because they're evil.
*  I don't think they're doing that because like.
*  They they've learned this way of being that sucks.
*  Now I'm not saying throw out the judicial system there shouldn't be you know jails or
*  anything like that I'm just saying this notion of humanity minus an authoritarian
*  generally fucking patriarchal fucking like whatever but I don't care if it's matriarchal
*  whatever it is it's a top down fucking ruling system without the king.
*  We will just fall on each other.
*  They're giving me your fucking car motherfucker.
*  Some of us will do that.
*  But guess what.
*  They won't last that long because like in a collectivized society I just feel like like
*  we'll take care of the problems quick probably quicker than we do right now and
*  everything will balance out.
*  If we're armed the problem is if you're not armed then armed thugs take over towns and
*  you can't do anything to stop them.
*  And you're in a small group of people that are unarmed and they're they're pushed into
*  certain situations.
*  If you if you have a collapse of law and order it's not as simple as we'll take care of
*  it. The real problem is sometimes armed thugs rule everything.
*  This is true.
*  Yeah. And that's that's a reality of humanity in 2024 like in certain parts of the world.
*  Like did you hear about what happened in Haiti.
*  Oh dude.
*  That minister.
*  His family.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. And the guy that that warlord in Haiti.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I love watching interviews with that guy.
*  What is his name again.
*  It's got a cool name.
*  It's like sandwich.
*  It was like barbecue.
*  There was this one video but it's not really it's not really of him.
*  Someone said it was of him but I guess it's not I think.
*  And it's a guy eating a guy.
*  So it's one of these rebels that has this dude killed roasting over a fire and takes a
*  piece off his leg.
*  That's a classic move.
*  That's like a classic movie.
*  You get their energy by eating them.
*  And look I'm not saying that there isn't contingents of like super violent people that
*  you are going to have to be able to defend yourself from.
*  And by the way what's really perplexing to me about the hardcore anti-gun people is
*  they're not really anti-gun.
*  They want cops and the National Guard to have guns.
*  They just don't want people that like people live in houses to have guns.
*  So they're like they're pro gun but they want guns in the hands of like their pro
*  authoritarian violent power.
*  Yeah that's it.
*  Authoritarians have power.
*  Regular people don't have power.
*  Right.
*  So you have to rely on the authority the authoritarians you have to rely on them to
*  take care of your crime issues.
*  Yeah.
*  See I think I would have more respect for that movement if they're like no more guns
*  anywhere.
*  We're going to get rid of all the guns in the world and melt them and melt them and
*  melt them and just I don't know build a fucking water slide or something.
*  No more hunting.
*  You get to hit things with bows and arrows.
*  Traps.
*  Traps.
*  Knives.
*  Knives.
*  They hunt pigs.
*  You can still hunt deer but you have to use a knife.
*  Yeah.
*  You imagine how many dudes get really good at like hiding in trees and drop it down and
*  stabbing deer.
*  Dude it would be amazing.
*  Like I might get into hunting like if it became.
*  Fucking throw a fucking dagger.
*  There's a dude that films pig hunts and he uses spears and he hides in trees like above
*  the pigs and then he has like a camera on the spear and he throws a spear down and
*  stabs these wild pigs.
*  Wow.
*  It's pretty wild.
*  Well I would love to know the first time he did that.
*  Like I would love to know.
*  Yeah.
*  How many times you how do you practice that?
*  Just.
*  But the lead you're just like what you're you're like driving.
*  You're like dude what if I fucking use this spear.
*  What if I climbed in a tree and started spearing pigs.
*  The thing about pigs is there's so many of them they'll do any.
*  You're allowed to do almost anything to get rid of them in Texas at least.
*  They hunt them out of helicopters.
*  Have you ever seen that?
*  No.
*  I've been invited three times.
*  I'm like I'm not getting.
*  I can't.
*  Don't get in.
*  With machine guns on top of that with pigs.
*  It's just if I feel like if I'm going to shoot a pig I want to eat the pig and if I'm
*  going to shoot 250 pigs there's no way I'm eating 250 pigs.
*  Yeah dude.
*  Yeah.
*  If I shoot one pig that pig will get eaten.
*  We'll make some barbecue out of that pig.
*  It'd be awesome.
*  But if you shoot two I mean I get it.
*  You have to do it though.
*  This is the other part of it.
*  If you run a farm you have to do it.
*  They'll kill your profit.
*  The profit margin of American farmers is so low as it is it's so difficult for them to
*  make money that if you got a million wild pigs running around your state or more Texas
*  has how many millions.
*  Isn't it like three million which is bananas.
*  If you know anything about like wild animal numbers that's so crazy to have that many
*  animals in a state.
*  Yeah.
*  Just wild feral animals.
*  Two point six from this is from six.
*  2016 says it.
*  But now in 2023 an estimate still they don't know.
*  Feral hogs they really don't know.
*  But at least two point six or a range of two point six there's no way you get at it.
*  You would actually have to like use drones at night fly over areas monitor how many
*  times they breed.
*  They breed three times a year dude.
*  Yeah.
*  They can start breeding when they're six months old.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  So six months old and then they have three litters a year and they'll have five six
*  piglets in a litter and they're just shit babies and they're just drawing everything.
*  They're just running through the ground tearing up fucking golf courses and people's
*  lawns in San Jose.
*  Have you ever seen the San Jose videos.
*  No San Jose California wild pigs just tearing apart people's fucking lawns.
*  Knocking over trash cans big fuckers.
*  Holy terrifying fuck to one of them killed a lady.
*  What.
*  Yeah.
*  Somewhere I forget where it was.
*  It might have been out here.
*  I think this lady saw the pigs fell down in her driveway and they just fucking tore her
*  apart.
*  Dude what who is that.
*  I just watched this like crime files thing about this psychopath who had pigs and she
*  would have people come and work for her.
*  And then if they pissed her off she throw them to the.
*  In the pigs.
*  And someone was saying when I'm if you're walking around the pigs you better not fall
*  because if you fall down they'll just fucking eat.
*  That's like the number one way people get killed by animals on farms.
*  Pigs eat you.
*  One woman's death by feral hog mate night have been caused by the animal after all.
*  Medical examiner determined that feral hog killed Christine Rollins but her daughter
*  is skeptical because attacks by the animal are extremely rare.
*  Wait a minute.
*  Fucking medical exam.
*  This is what a confusing headline said one woman's death by feral hog might not have
*  been caused by the animal after all.
*  But the medical examiner said it was caused by the wild hog.
*  But the daughter is saying attacks by the animal are extremely rare.
*  Well believe the daughter.
*  The daughter was the daughter.
*  The daughter could be doing anything.
*  Haven't you seen Charlotte's Web.
*  Devin use these pigs would never.
*  What is the daughter saying.
*  I don't understand.
*  Why does she think that because they do fuck everything up.
*  Especially if you fall down.
*  Fox also has attacks by feral hogs are extremely rare.
*  Less than one in a million chance according to research data.
*  That's why some are now suspicious that her cause of death is really due to an attack
*  by the animal.
*  What.
*  What.
*  What's more suspicious that her cause of death was really due to an attack by the
*  animal rather sorry.
*  What's more dogs are found lingering around Rollins body after her death.
*  There's really no doubt that hogs got to her body at some point.
*  The question is whether the hog might she might be killed by dogs.
*  Was something else cause of the dying the hogs came along.
*  Right.
*  That's possible.
*  That's totally possible.
*  Sure.
*  It's definitely possible.
*  But how old was this lady.
*  Fifty nine.
*  That pig looks suspicious as fuck man.
*  Depends on like what kind of 59 year old lady you're talking about.
*  Lady goes to CrossFit.
*  You're talking about ladies 59 and has diabetes because like if you fall down
*  around wild pigs like I kind of think they're going to treat you the same way.
*  Domestic pigs do if domestic pigs start eating if you fall into the pig pen.
*  There's a crazy story I heard about a kid that raised a hog that went it just one
*  day turned on him like he's raised it his entire life.
*  It was like his pet like my dog is everywhere with him.
*  And then one day he said he tripped in the pen and it just attacked him and almost
*  killed him.
*  Oh my god.
*  I forget it was a crazy story.
*  I forget even where I saw but it's just popping in my head now like horrible way
*  to die.
*  Bro could you imagine getting eaten alive by a pig.
*  No no.
*  That squeal.
*  But wouldn't we have it come in.
*  How much bacon have you eaten.
*  A lot.
*  I've eaten a lot of bacon.
*  A lot.
*  I've eaten a lot of bacon.
*  I love this is where the vegans get really excited.
*  Boy I'm going to get a lot of cute pig fucking pictures.
*  Vegans need to hear that lettuce scream.
*  They should hear it scream.
*  It screams screams.
*  Let it screams.
*  Yeah all of its screams.
*  Avocados scream.
*  His best friend was a 250 pound warthog.
*  Oh it's a warthog.
*  Well it's an African animal.
*  It's a different animal.
*  I don't think that's I mean I think that's like a distant cousin to a pig.
*  They look different.
*  They're crazy looking.
*  You ever see the warthog.
*  No bro.
*  They got like these crazy double tusks.
*  Dude look at it.
*  Look at that thing.
*  Fuck that.
*  In that wild.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at his tusks.
*  This is my friend.
*  Yeah.
*  That dude is not your friend.
*  He's incapable.
*  That's a wild beast.
*  That is so much different than a guy raising a hog.
*  Like if that guy raised a pig the pig would probably never do that.
*  That thing is a wild animal.
*  Yeah.
*  Where was this?
*  Texas on their family ranch.
*  The story about how.
*  I forget how.
*  It's so crazy out here.
*  He called the house and someone knew what was happening.
*  It's awesome.
*  It's awesome to be in a place where you could own a wild fucking warthog.
*  Dude Texas like my wife and I talk about this all the time.
*  We're never leaving.
*  We're like this is home.
*  We love it so much.
*  It's what America aspires to be.
*  Dude it is.
*  And like people are so mad at us and people bitch about it and make but it's like man I love it here so much and I like the heat and I in like.
*  Weirdly all of us are like we're like getting healthy man like like it's this crime in all the years of the comic store.
*  Lots of changes happen among the comics like the time.
*  I hope I can talk about this.
*  I think I can.
*  He talks about it like remember like he does talk about Bobby Lee talks about it publicly like the time Bobby Lee was like on pills.
*  And he talks about so he would bring all these pills to the comedy store and we all knew it.
*  And so he was like a pharmacist so like like Joey Joey watching Joey like grab a handful of just unknown Mexican fucking pharmaceuticals.
*  This is pre-fetinal dog.
*  Yeah pre-fetinal.
*  You could do those things back then.
*  Dude and so that that was I would call that a dark phase in the comedy store because all of us were on Bobby Lee's fucking Mexican Viking.
*  It was a bad phase so so but I don't think I've ever seen a phase where like at a comedy club the comics are getting healthier.
*  You know that's a crazy thing to watch and I think you know it's not just us hanging out when I first came to Texas and I'm not saying everyone's here is healthy or any kind of bullshit like that but.
*  You look around like these people are fucking healthy like there's a lot of healthy like you know what I mean like like tough fucking people and a lot of people who exercise.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Just go to the lake watch people run around the lake.
*  Dude in the lake.
*  In the middle of a heat wave.
*  Before I was exercising one of the most like humiliating things was just to be driving down the street and you look over and there's someone my age it's one hundred and four degrees and they're fucking jogging and you know what I mean like what's your excuse again.
*  Oh you're tired you're sleepy is a little too fucking hot because there's a fucking fifty five year old there's a fifty five year old just galloping down the burning fucking sidewalk.
*  Yeah.
*  So yeah dude this place is like a lot of running is a different kind of hot too because you're getting that heat radiating off of the concrete into your face.
*  You know Lex Freeman does that shit.
*  Oh yeah he's a psycho.
*  He fucking runs like when I did his podcast he's like I'm going jogging.
*  I'm like what are you talking about.
*  Like I this is in my like early Texas face so I was already like I walked from my car to his place and was already like Jesus fucking Christ.
*  Walking.
*  And he's like yeah I'm going to go jog 10 miles.
*  I'm like what the fuck are you man.
*  In this heat.
*  Yeah dude.
*  Yeah it's so I think it's important to be around like I think that's another aspect of Texas that gets left out is like there's this there's this real like strength healthy thing here that is contagious.
*  Whereas like when you're in a place where everyone's all fucking sick and frail and weak and like you know what I mean scared of disease like trembling in their fucking boots.
*  That's contagious too.
*  It is.
*  Jumps into you man.
*  It 100 percent does.
*  And I always wonder like how much of you know how much of an area has the memory of all the things that have happened in that area in it.
*  And like whereas Texas is the last state to enter into the union they've always been like hang the fuck back.
*  Hold on.
*  You know we had to get through the Comanche to establish this place like settle down.
*  You know Texas Rangers had to go out there and cold camp and go and try to assassinate these bands of fucking killers riding horses which is fucking up the Americans like they couldn't pass.
*  They couldn't pass they couldn't get through.
*  This was the spot where it's like this place was fucked and until they conquered it it stayed fucked and then they did.
*  And now it's the whole place has a memory of that.
*  Yes.
*  There's a there's a there's a thing about the attitude of this place.
*  Yeah dude.
*  It's but it's it's not what people think.
*  Like people think they're assholes.
*  They're the nicest friendliest people.
*  People think they're stupid.
*  They are some brilliant people that I've met that live out here.
*  Brilliant normal people.
*  One of my neighbors was a Texas Ranger and he is the coolest guy.
*  And you know he's an older guy now he's retired but he's still intimidating.
*  And yeah man like he like he like he's like he's so fucking cool man and like and he I'm trying not to give away to you.
*  Respecting his privacy.
*  He every once in a while in the neighborhood we would hear this boom sounds like a generator exploding and like it's his can.
*  He's got like a little fucking cannon and like he like he likes.
*  Shots a cannon in his yard.
*  It's a little but like he's so.
*  What's he shooting at.
*  Well he doesn't put cannonballs in it.
*  There's a way to do it.
*  So like my kid like one day pulls up in front of my house with a truck.
*  It's like one of my kids like had just had a birthday and he's like do they want to see the cannon.
*  I do.
*  I know I do.
*  It's so like it was like the coolest thing ever man.
*  He takes his fucking can little cannon.
*  I'm looking at it.
*  I'm like that can't be loud.
*  You know what I mean.
*  He takes this little cannon.
*  He does some crazy like pirate shit with it that I still don't understand.
*  He's like knows how to operate a cannon.
*  Boom.
*  My kids were like holy shit.
*  My neighbors ran into the yard because they thought something had happened.
*  Well Duncan you've shot guns before.
*  Yeah.
*  Think about how little gunpowder is in.
*  Right.
*  Like a nine millimeter.
*  Right.
*  It's not a lot.
*  It's crazy loud.
*  Right.
*  You're right.
*  It's just contained by that barrel.
*  Yeah right.
*  And so a cannon.
*  Shooting out that.
*  Yeah.
*  I got you.
*  That gas and that bullet.
*  But it's basically like a little cannon.
*  It's kind of the same thing.
*  Well it totally made me like you know gave me a new picture of like cannon battles on ships.
*  Bro imagine how loud that was.
*  I mean imagine how loud that was.
*  Like real cannons.
*  Yeah I do.
*  Like I've been to a football game when they shoot off a cannon.
*  But I don't know if that was like a real cannon.
*  Cannon.
*  You know like probably probably like the UNLV.
*  What do they use.
*  I mean not UNLV.
*  Yeah.
*  UNLV.
*  I blame the weed.
*  Dude the like the UT one.
*  Do they have.
*  That's it.
*  Civil War cannon.
*  Hey guys.
*  Let it go.
*  Yeah maybe recreate an earlier cannon guys.
*  I'm like you can do a fucking pirate cannon.
*  Yeah do a pirate cannon.
*  Which side bro.
*  It says it fires four shotgun shells after every time.
*  That's crazy.
*  Oh so that's what it does.
*  It does shotgun shells.
*  10 gauge blank shotgun shells.
*  OK.
*  OK.
*  So I guess that's probably not the sound of an actual cannon.
*  Look at that.
*  Look at that crazy.
*  That's a happy cannon man.
*  Yeehaw.
*  It's really loud.
*  But the point is I wonder like to shoot a cannon ball like at a ship back then like how much gunpowder they use and how fucking loud was that.
*  And how deaf were those motherfuckers.
*  The dudes who had to work the cannons.
*  Deaf.
*  Deaf as fuck.
*  Deaf.
*  Deaf as fuck dude.
*  And how much brain damage you get just standing next to that thing.
*  Boom.
*  Or the recoil.
*  What's going off.
*  Yeah.
*  The recoil if you don't get out of the way it will fucking rip your leg off.
*  God man.
*  Yeah.
*  That thing is flying back right.
*  Didn't they have them on tracks.
*  Yeah man.
*  Yeah.
*  They it will like.
*  So it doesn't rip out of the fucking floor.
*  Didn't they have like cannons on tracks.
*  I just saw this.
*  Did I make that up.
*  That's probably how they just moved them.
*  No I thought they were on tracks like so that when they shot they would slide back and not rip the floor apart.
*  I just saw that John Adams doc on Netflix.
*  I think it's on Netflix.
*  I don't know what it's on but there was like a cannon battle in a ship.
*  And like yeah a dude just gets his fucking leg ripped off because it like back it like goes back into it.
*  I mean it's dude.
*  Isn't it crazy that that seems crazy to us.
*  But like how many people died in cannon battles as opposed to like when Israel bombs Gaza.
*  Dude.
*  How many people are like a bomb which we do right now.
*  It seems so much more brutal than cannon battles like cannon battle seem like really ineffective.
*  They probably sucked.
*  Yeah.
*  How far did that cannon ball go.
*  Like how good were they at judging it.
*  Here we go.
*  This is what a cannon is like.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah see how it slides back.
*  It's on wheels.
*  Yep.
*  And then there's a rope that catches it.
*  Yeah dude.
*  Dude.
*  What a.
*  Imagine life back then.
*  And they thought that was the shit.
*  That was like a fucking iPhone 16.
*  Bro I got a cannon.
*  Yeah.
*  You know we used to be able to used to have to go up to the boat jump in hack everybody did light it on fire.
*  Now think it you shoot it from over here.
*  Incredible.
*  You don't even have to jump on the boat.
*  Amazing.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah man.
*  I'll tell you though with all the shit that's going on right now.
*  I know everyone's freaked out but the reason I'm hopeful is not because of like the bombings and the deaths obviously.
*  It's the outcry.
*  Like like when in history has there been this level of outcry like no.
*  What are you doing.
*  Stop.
*  Like to me like that's the sign that human consciousness is like evolving to value life in a way that maybe we didn't value before.
*  Because like there there have been infinite wars and like including like the how many people did we fucking bomb.
*  How many people how many civilians did we fucking kill when we were fucking bombing Iraq.
*  How many.
*  No there's a it's a lot right.
*  Well they don't know like the full number.
*  You get two different people's numbers but they think that it's somewhere in the neighborhood of a million people died.
*  Right.
*  So so in that is that is that correct.
*  Is that I think it's also like deaths that they attribute to things that happened because of the war.
*  But I think it led to a million innocent deaths or somewhere in that range.
*  That was a high end.
*  But there was an outcry over that war but not the same as this.
*  But yeah but if you think about the numbers like yeah I think it's also the access that we have now to cell phone footage and how good it is and how quickly it gets posted.
*  That's relatively recently.
*  You know.
*  Yeah.
*  Like that's the real abilities of these phones like to make videos like they do now.
*  How long has that been going on.
*  You're right.
*  Ten years.
*  You're right.
*  You know.
*  Hundred thousand.
*  Sixty six thousand civilians.
*  Two hundred ten thousand two hundred ninety six civilian deaths from violence.
*  Hundred nine thousand deaths including sixty six thousand eighty one civilian.
*  That's weird.
*  I don't understand what they're saying there.
*  What's that.
*  It just pulled that section from the middle of this whole thing.
*  Civilian deaths from violence.
*  Does that mean war.
*  Like what does that mean.
*  So that's civilians that were killed entirely by war or is that civilian to die just from violence.
*  Well any kind of violence.
*  Yeah.
*  Like stabbing your neighbor.
*  But this is like Carlin does jokes about this.
*  This is what's really insidious about this shit.
*  It's like it's war.
*  Yeah.
*  Say it's fucking war.
*  It's like it's like the violence.
*  The violence is related to war.
*  So don't say from violence say from fucking war because that's what war does.
*  And you know it's really crazy.
*  Looking at dead human numbers.
*  Go put that back up please.
*  When you're looking at the number 210,296 civilian deaths from violence when you look at that number you just it's so two dimensional.
*  You don't get an understanding of how insanely evil that number really is.
*  210,296 people that didn't have to die.
*  How many memories.
*  That died because someone wanted to do something and got a group of people to go and do their bidding and they all were there all were authorized to shoot people.
*  Yeah man.
*  Yes this is a crazy thing that we still do as human beings.
*  And the problem is I don't see a way out of it because terrorists are real criminals are real bad people are real.
*  This is the world we're living in.
*  Unless.
*  You take mushrooms.
*  We got to get mushrooms legal for the entire country the whole country.
*  Yeah.
*  And just force them down everybody's throat.
*  Do force people to do mushrooms.
*  Do it for everyone else.
*  That's our robots.
*  That's our robot fucking like like like like a bird.
*  It just pokes its fucking thing in your mouth and spray psilocybin in there.
*  Can you imagine if AI forced us all to take psilocybin.
*  What a horrible day that would be.
*  But imagine if like that was AI solution.
*  AI was like human beings actually developed their consciousness through this sort of relationship that they had with kubensis mushrooms.
*  And this is the facts and this is how we know and this is why the doubling of the human brain size is such an anomaly and it aligns with the Terrence McKenna's theories about how the grasslands receded.
*  You know it's an upgrade.
*  The rainforest receded into grasslands and people started eating cow shit bugs and cow shit mushrooms and then they started thinking about things different.
*  Oh my God.
*  Imagine if AI tells us that's how it would.
*  So you just need to keep going.
*  Yeah I would say.
*  Yeah.
*  You guys like quit.
*  Like you know you got your purple belt and you like try to get an injury and you backed out.
*  Go deeper.
*  Go deeper.
*  You need to go a little deeper.
*  Little deeper.
*  Little bit.
*  And if AI just like tells people like this is what you really should be taking.
*  Imagine if like instead of mushrooms especially psilocybin instead of it being something that terrifies people and that makes people think oh my God you take it you're going to lose your mind.
*  You take it you're going to be a fucking loser.
*  Imagine if it was actually scientifically proven that it does make you smarter and it makes you more effective at being a person and that these are the right doses.
*  Imagine if AI just starts spitting out doses in order to gain this percentage of increase in cognitive ability.
*  Fucking best.
*  You can get this percentage of increase in empathy at this dose for this many days and it just starts like re-energy engineering human beings through psilocybin.
*  You know one of the things Ram Dass said which I love is when they they would ask him things like how you know how did this happen to you how did you get.
*  Where how do you get like to be this benevolent like thing that is radiating love all the time which he was.
*  He goes I trusted the mushroom.
*  Any minute dude and because because I don't know that we get our on us without psilocybin like is that like these is a beautiful famous story of him.
*  Hanging out with Tim Leary and some other like luminaries and they had synthetic psilocybin and that was pretty much like the real beginning of his like path and like.
*  It you know I'm sometimes I'm a little skeptical about this concept because I worry that because I've met people who are really into psychedelics who are like somehow it went the opposite direction they're really kind of egoic.
*  They're into the dosage and how many times very guru like good they become guru you know that but by the way guru isn't always bad.
*  Not always but they become narcissistic they become power gurus more like sorcerers and in co leaders co leaders and so so yeah so like.
*  I worry that you know because everyone's like what if we just gave Putin a shit ton of mushrooms it's like well it's going to go one of two ways like it's going to be like where you just like is like oh my fucking God.
*  Oh my fucking God I thought I was Russian I'm an earthling what the fuck was I think this is I was conditioned this is brainwashing I got brainwashed by culture.
*  And it's over guys no more of this shit I retire I'm moving to fucking Hawaii whatever but like the air goes the other way which is like.
*  Oh God wants me to fire nuclear missile.
*  You know we don't know roll the dice right roll the dice so yeah but I do think if we're looking at like massive like instantaneous shifts in in planetary consciousness psychedelics definitely one of the ways like if you were to the brotherhood of eternal love.
*  No but.
*  I don't like the way it sounds I think you'd like them.
*  Just the name it's like that sounds like the bad people in some really corny movie does brotherhood of eternal love the brotherhood of eternal love speaking of which I saw a really good movie last night what what it is I think it's called late night with the devil.
*  It's about it's a twenty twenty four movie about a talk show host in nineteen seventy seven that has this girl come on the show and it's like really done like like it looks like you're in nineteen seventy seven.
*  And the girls possessed and it like it builds man dude it's so fucking good have you seen this yes oh you loved it right I loved it it's great it's so good night with the devil official I mean I think it just came out a couple months ago I must have just went.
*  Straight to being streamed but it's fucking good man and that's good casting dude all of it like that the host is so much like that level talk shows from that time period and it's scary and it's fucking good yeah it's solid.
*  Highly recommend yeah it was solid it was really solid solid dude and dude you know what I just saw that and I was super skeptical about this one but it's not bad the Pope's exorcist really that did I know I had the same.
*  I had the same thinking my my my brother in law who's got like really good taste in movies and like he's like it's actually not that bad it's a little cheesy it's fucking good dude really yes it's very good and like but stupid but good.
*  You know what I mean like this is the Pope's exorcist yeah and I usually don't get into Russell Crowe I don't get into exorcist movies usually why do they all fucking turn their head like that but it what's interesting is this guy the Pope has an exorcist and he wrote a bunch of fucking books.
*  And so it's kind of drawing from like stories of this guy doing exorcisms and it's it's in it's fascinating man it's really interesting.
*  It would be the greatest deception ever if demonic possession was real and we were all mocking it and then one day you saw it actually saw it like oh no it's real.
*  Dude I think it is real like like you I think we've just come up with new words for it but have you ever had this happen I'm gonna get made fun of this if you ever had this happen like if you ever been like super high you're walking down the street you pass somebody having a psychotic episode.
*  And they start saying what you're thinking if you ever had that happen no I have really yeah I mean what were you thinking though I'm hot.
*  I feel crazy I feel crazy I feel crazy I feel crazy I'm hot.
*  Oh my god he knows he can read my mind.
*  I'm too high right now.
*  He can read my mind.
*  No no it was like no he was like kind of like he was like garbling out like shit.
*  I think I was thinking about like I mean obviously any of this stuff it's not scientific obviously it's not scientific.
*  Wait a minute you're not a scientist.
*  I am a scientist I am actually yeah I am a fucking scientist I study rainbows I study the power of rainbows to heal animals.
*  I forget who posted it up but there's some video of all these college kids talking about it went viral all these college kids talking about what their degree was in and these all these woke kids with these ridiculous degrees like what they studied.
*  Yeah man dude very expensive to get those fucking degrees.
*  It is a hilarious video because it's like how does anybody not see that that is a massive waste of your time.
*  Like what have you done you have been tricked you have been tricked into getting a degree in nonsense.
*  Dude.
*  And then write papers in nonsense and books on nonsense.
*  But aside from that you know you've really been tricked into you've become a fucking vassal of the banks.
*  Like you are eternally indebted to the structures that you are opposing.
*  It's like oh oh what's your oh so you spent how much again like one hundred and eighty thousand dollars to get to major in like communist studies.
*  Great.
*  Okay.
*  You're late on your payment motherfucker.
*  You got to pay us now.
*  Not only that it's the ultimate mafia group like they want your money no matter what.
*  Even if Social Security fuck you pay me.
*  They're the ultimate fuck you pay me people.
*  Fuck you pay me.
*  You can't apparently we said we talked about this before but apparently there are certain circumstances under which there's a certain type of bankruptcy that allow you to evade that.
*  But I wonder what that is.
*  It's suicide.
*  I don't understand enough to interrupt.
*  Yeah I remember us talking about it.
*  I don't understand it either.
*  Dude this is like man.
*  Well we've definitely talked about this before but rest in peace.
*  David Graber wrote a great book called Bullshit Jobs.
*  Brilliant mind man brilliant mind.
*  But he basically talks about how like so ideas.
*  I'm going to go to college.
*  Discharge.
*  No problem man.
*  Discharge and bankruptcy if you declare bankruptcy and then the bankruptcy court determines repaying your loans would cause undue hardship.
*  Your loans can be discharged.
*  How many times does that happen.
*  Zero.
*  It's like yeah it's legal as long as the judge decides.
*  I'm sorry but repaying your loans always produces undue fucking hardship.
*  It sucks to pay back loans.
*  It sucks.
*  It always sucks.
*  I want a fucking nice computer.
*  I want a boat.
*  I want a swimming board.
*  Like for example several types of loans associated with education expenses are are dischargeable in bankruptcy like most other types of unsecured consumer debt.
*  These types of loans for education expenses are not subject to the more difficult standard and extra step.
*  These loans could include for example loans where the loan amount was higher than the cost of the attendance such as tuition books rooms and board which can occur when a loan is paid directly to a consumer.
*  Loans pay for education.
*  So that means they could do it.
*  They could they could they could forgive you if the loan amount was higher than the cost of attendance.
*  Is that what it's saying or is it saying it's going to pay you the difference like you could you could deduct the difference when you get a bankruptcy.
*  Loans to pay for education at places that are not eligible for title for funding include unaccredited colleges a school in a foreign country.
*  So so much for your wizard university Duncan.
*  Yeah you can't you're not you can't go bankrupt with your wizard degree.
*  You still have to pay.
*  Are you fucking getting him up to my neck.
*  You have to pay debt for this shit.
*  It says you have to pay.
*  And also it's like it's unaccredited.
*  The rainbow thing it's like something's changed in the Earth's atmosphere because it's not healing anymore.
*  It's an unaccredited wizard school.
*  Yeah you went cheap and now you're fucked.
*  Well I'm sorry Joe.
*  Not everybody was born a billionaire like you.
*  I wasn't born.
*  I know you weren't I'm joking.
*  I don't think that that wizard stuff is good anyway.
*  I think it's I think you're you're toying with the devil.
*  Just like that late night show.
*  I'm that little bald guy.
*  OK.
*  I was like in the show.
*  That's me.
*  Well I'm like hey you're messing with something.
*  Can I ask you something.
*  Yes.
*  Where did the devil come from.
*  That's a good question.
*  Did God make the devil.
*  What a mean trick.
*  Right.
*  Imagine.
*  Do you need the devil.
*  Do you need.
*  Is it symbolic of what we need in this life.
*  Like do we need to see what's happening in Palestine in order to reassess the way we behave as a civilization.
*  Do we need crime to get out of hand before we realize that law and order is important and that we really need to like figure out a way to stop crime at its root source.
*  Was this disenfranchised people.
*  Do we really need some.
*  Maybe that's the only way we learn.
*  Maybe there's like you know like lottery winners.
*  They don't do well dude.
*  They don't do well because they didn't learn.
*  Right.
*  They just got all this money like wow and then they're doing blow and they're on a fucking dot.
*  And yeah it's gone.
*  Now it's gone.
*  Now you're mad and everybody's mad at you.
*  Yeah.
*  You didn't invest in the business with your uncle.
*  Yeah.
*  And everybody's pissed at you.
*  So you're asking do we need the devil.
*  I wonder if you need a bad and a good.
*  I wonder if you need something.
*  I wonder if you need to see 200 plus thousand dead people and just have that number in your head and just try to picture what that looks like.
*  I wonder if we need that.
*  Resist.
*  In order to realize.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  That there's like you don't grow without resistance.
*  This is we're thinking of it as just playing.
*  This is life.
*  But we're in the middle of a process.
*  Yeah.
*  We're in the middle of a process.
*  Everyone understands this and no one thinks about it.
*  Right.
*  We are in the middle of this intellectually evolutionary process.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's there's something that's funny that I said those two words in such a goofy way.
*  Intellectual.
*  I liked it.
*  Evolution.
*  But it's there's a thing going on where we're assuming that civilization is going to be better all the time and we're always going to get better all the time which is really interesting because no other animal does that.
*  There's not another animal alive that says we only killed you know 47 zebras this year.
*  Next year we're fucking cranking it up.
*  We're going to be better and more efficient.
*  Yeah.
*  We want to be better at everything.
*  We want to be better at our industry.
*  We want to be better at fixing our infrastructure.
*  We want to be better at housing.
*  Yeah.
*  We want to be better all the time.
*  Like this is constant push for progress.
*  Right.
*  And if you just step back and look at where it's going with this train wreck of AI happening at the same time that's going on it's like oh we were fueling this.
*  Yeah.
*  We're fueling the takeover.
*  We were buying iPhones.
*  Dude I think this is so funny you're mentioning this because honestly it's so embarrassing.
*  This is so dumb.
*  I don't care.
*  I'm wearing a robot outfit.
*  The gym yesterday I'm working out and I've started listening to classic gospel music.
*  Whoa.
*  It is so good.
*  If you're having a shitty day it doesn't matter if you're not Christian.
*  Just fucking listen to it.
*  It's so upbeat and like it makes you happy and it's kind of magical.
*  But like so I'm at the gym and I'm thinking about Jesus because I've been listening to gospel music and like I was thinking like.
*  Oh.
*  Oh like maybe the idea as far as like the devil goes because I always wonder that who made the devil why did God make the devil why is there a devil is there a devil is it just a fucking symbol for something but I realized like oh like you know that stupid song if you love some if you love somebody.
*  Set them free.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like the idea being I'm setting I'm making you you're sentient and I'm setting you free and I'm setting you free in a fucking universe where there are there's collectivized evil there's some kind of like like somatics there's some kind of thing that forms which will fuck you up.
*  And because I love you I'm going to let you figure it out and and and and and and then from from that perspective and also if there is some super intelligence and somehow in the universe there's a bifurcation or something that's.
*  Centered on the self instead of others that has an intelligence to it to really like fucking flex to that thing you're like okay I'm just going to give you these things that I love so much and if you win if you corrupt my creation fully then.
*  Then you win I was wrong but I don't think you are I don't think it's going to happen because inevitably whatever it is you take a psychedelic for me whenever I take psychedelics too many right away I started thinking about how selfish I am I start thinking like dude like it hurts.
*  It hurts to be jealous it hurts to not help it hurts to be so cherishing of myself and anytime I'm not doing that I'm so happy yeah so but to to to force that you can't force that on somebody they have to stumble upon it somehow and there's like that's Christianity that they don't get it unless they feel it.
*  That's it and so like to let these things that theoretically I'm talking about from Christian cosmology that you love more than anything else to to fuck it which by the way like in the Garden of Eden story.
*  When God is crying like God says something like where are you to Adam and Eve and apparently that the originals the original translation that crying out is the way of like you know if you ever lost your kid at a playground.
*  It's that it's not like where are you slaves it's like you're when you're calling for your kids so yeah it's heavy man and so like so yeah I feel like.
*  That maybe the whole thing is designed for us individually to stumble upon that that basic truth that.
*  Underneath the shell is love and the love wants to express itself and love doesn't express itself by saying me me me me me me me love is always like I love you, what can I do for you, let me help you.
*  It's like the person swimming into the lake for no reason to get that last person who fucking was in a car accident and they drown you know they get the person to save you they die, this is.
*  To me, I think that's the devil that's why it's there it's it might it might be real, I think, is a term of convenience it's great but it's like holy shit man like.
*  As an inclination it's real right like whether or not you murder a baby because the devil made you do it or because some other force that is just like the devil.
*  That just happens to be a part of human beings violent rages they could do horrific things and then, on top of that also intentionally evil just like chimpanzees yeah I mean chimpanzees do it, do we think the devil's invading the chimps and they're doing it or do we think that this is some bygone.
*  Some leftover shit that's in our DNA that can go sideways and allow people to become serial killers do people to become assassins I think it's a semantics argument I think it's like it's an identification of a possibility in a human life, there is a possibility in a human life.
*  To make a series of shitty decisions and those shitty decisions lead you into darker and darker and darker experiences of reality and the darker your experience of reality, the more likely you are to make a shitty decision because like you've gotten yourself into fucking debt you went to wizard school you've got.
*  You've got your you study fucking rainbow magic it doesn't seem to be real no one's coming to your clinic now you're like you know $800,000 and fucking debt and now what are you going to fucking do like you got to figure out a way to make money so how are you going to make the fucking money well.
*  You find some scam or some shit right and then the next thing you know now you're like lying to people and now that you're lying to people you have to keep fucking lying to people and then you start lying to yourself and then you get lost in a maze of self deception that leads you into lower and lower and lower levels of consciousness until the next thing you know you're in fucking jail or you're dead you're killing somebody and so so like you call it whatever you want to fucking call it but this in tropic reality in human existence is very fucking real.
*  And the message of all the great lineages whether it's Hinduism Christianity Buddhism is at any given moment in that hell state you've gotten yourself into there is a way to get the fuck out you don't have to be in hell it's like what CS Lewis says the gates of hell are locked from the inside there's a fucking way out.
*  It's so good dude it's so good it's so good that's such a good one and that's you know that's that's why I love Jesus that's why I love the message of Christianity.
*  Look into Jesus praise God.
*  I read that song right yeah dude are you I'm not fucking great it shows up on my gospel playlist isn't it weird that that guy like that was it.
*  It was like that was his song it is like this one song that was a banger but you listen to the rest of them.
*  I know that sucks oh God man that's the worst there's a few of those guys that we feel you know Johnny Thunder you know that song I'm alive no bro I played that song for so many fucking people including musicians you know I play it for Zach Brian he was like.
*  Like you hear it people like God damn and it's from 1969 one hit wonder dude I don't even think it was a hit there was another version of it that that his version of I'm alive was a cover of.
*  And it was better than the original version and it was so good you like if this guy can make this song somebody needs to write for him man this guy's a star this guy's got bangers I mean this was a fucking tremendous song and it was just one.
*  Dude I know it's like that's got that just is like it's got to be so scary man like oh yeah you know when you make a great movie and then you got to make your next movie and like it's got to be fucking good like say you make that movie.
*  What's it called Deus Ex Machina you know that movie yeah yeah yeah and you're like you're I got to make another movie and then you're like Civil War and oh fuck.
*  I'm sorry I'm sorry I guess that that is the guy right.
*  Man I'm sorry Alex Garland like by the way you're brilliant like like I get it like the attempt I get it and who knows you never know what happened in the process and like man I feel like now that this is so I started doing video.
*  And I'm recognizing just like how hard it is just to like get the lighting right for my dumb ass sitting there rambling like anyone who makes a fucking movie is a genius fucking wizard so I do fit in all the people that come together.
*  Some of them just don't work out the way they want they just don't work out they just don't work out that's how it is like like pilots for TV shows it's for sketches that people create yeah yeah you know.
*  But like I just like I think doing a video podcast and then critiquing a great director is pretty fucked up man I just I don't mean I just and a lot of people like the movie but.
*  You try to dig yourself out.
*  Like no I but god damn it was horrible.
*  So that's a layer it was so bad yeah it's funny yeah I'm glad I didn't see it.
*  No you you you're lucky to have you been watching the gentleman on netflix now what's that.
*  It's a guy richie series on netflix it's fucking amazing what is it it's about these weed growers in in the UK cool it's I don't want to give away any more of it but it's basically the movie the gentleman on a.
*  I don't know if you ever saw the movie but this is the the same world that the movie takes place in just with different characters well it's fucking great man it's great show I think it has like six episodes or how many episodes that have eight.
*  There's some good movies coming out right now man it's kind of awesome we went through like a pretty rough cinema drought I don't know do you remember.
*  I mean you got to think about how many movies get they get drawn up they get funded covid hits everything gets shut down everything gets shut down and then everybody loses money no one's going to the movies anymore yeah it's fucked yeah.
*  You have to wait for forever before things get back on track and start getting profitable again and they start making dune to.
*  I haven't seen it but it's awesome they start making movies like that they start making banger movies again dude dune to is so fucking good.
*  I watched it with a song and dude I was like you know that like you get bliss and movies are so good and you're the.
*  you're the right amount of stone and like you realize like oh my God it's only been 30 fucking minutes, and this is already the most insanely beautiful thing i've ever seen in my fucking life the soundtrack.
*  When you look up how they made the soundtrack for that movie it is insane man everything about it is like they had throat singing in it they've got like.
*  it's so cool dude do you read the books no.
*  The first one honestly the second one I struggle with the first one is wait a minute with book dune no I didn't read that frank herbert it's one of the.
*  No I think I read.
*  I think I read one of those did they they make them into like comic books like really nice comic probably did they.
*  But you can't I never got into the first one the first movie so when the second one came around I was like.
*  A dude I keep hearing it's amazing second one's better than the first and the first is great if you're like a dune nerd which I am but you're a dune oh i'm a dune or i've been reading that book since.
*  Dude the spice melange and like but the way he's first of all frank herbert was a mycologist the guy wrote dune did you know that he's like a really respect stamets talks about it like yeah.
*  whoa.
*  I am.
*  Duncan this is what gonna happen when trump wins.
*  Robert de Niro is right Robert de Niro is right Duncan do you want to line up and lose all your rights and he never leaves the White House and you have throat singing on the Capitol Hill steps.
*  So funny I was like dude that sounds awesome.
*  Everybody's needs and gets a gun.
*  Sneaking will give you money.
*  It's a game for us dude um yeah so like the the there's always theories about dune but the blue eyes so you eat this spice melange.
*  That like though that you need it for space travel it's only produced on you know the story but like yeah the blue eyes so there's a theory because he was frank herbert was a mycologist.
*  The blue eyes represent psilocybin and like that was his melange is like psilocybin and like.
*  Dude and he he apparently I think it's Sam Fran he was living on a boat next to Alan Watts.
*  Oh and they were they were fucking friends so a lot of the like.
*  You remember the gum jibar the the needle that that which puts to Paul it's ready his neck to say like they want to find out if you're human so you put your hand.
*  In this box that if you pull your fucking hand out of the box she stabs you with this needle it kills you because you're not human who gives a fuck and so.
*  Gum jibar gum is in Tibetan Buddhism is the name for meditation so there's all these like clearly he was pals with Alan Watts.
*  And he like like weaves a lot of like a lot of the language in it is like the the the daughter in the womb I think her name is a Leah.
*  Which is like a Buddhist term for like the emptiness for a state of pure consciousness and so it's a deep book is my point and you would love it.
*  And it inspired Star Wars right didn't we just talk about this we did right.
*  Duncan might know more about that but it was that they came from the same thing I think.
*  What do you mean.
*  Doon and Star Wars came from the same place like they both were inspired by the same thing I asked that question out loud I thought.
*  I thought we talked about it the other day did we not talk about it on the podcast.
*  OK we did right but I think it was started doing came before Star Wars and then Star Wars was written by different people.
*  I don't know.
*  I think doing predates Star Wars Star Wars we talked about the other day what is the whole story that were you trying to say I didn't understand what they both.
*  I had asked that out loud I said didn't isn't doing just start Star Wars is a dune ripoff and then I dug into it and it says that they both.
*  Are I'm sorry both creators took similarities and inspiration from the same original source.
*  I think it's what's the original.
*  I'm trying to read as I'm talking that's so there's something else there was an original story like I'm sorry.
*  A short story is influenced probably it's like one of the it's like the greatest sci fi book if you ask me and it's influenced all sci fi.
*  It's so fucking good dude and did you see David Lynch's dune.
*  No.
*  Oh man you got to watch Sting is in David Lynch's dune and like I did see it that was the original one right.
*  The Lynch one was the original.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't get into it.
*  No.
*  Well it was massively criticized because like there have been attempts to do dune this famous guy Jodorowsky there's a whole documentary on his idea for dune.
*  David Lynch takes on the project and where the dune we have now succeeds where he failed is they broke the book into two movies.
*  Every sci fi property I love is based on foundation.
*  Interesting.
*  Isaac Asimov's foundation series is widely understood to be the inspiration for Star Wars dune and even the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
*  Wow.
*  You know one of the things about the new dune is the people that grimy.
*  Right.
*  They look like they're really in that world.
*  There was a thing about those old dunes that I couldn't get into because everybody looked too clean.
*  Everybody looked like they just stepped right out of wardrobe.
*  I just didn't.
*  You know what I'm saying.
*  Like you see that when the guys throat singing and those people are walking down and putting everybody's dirty.
*  Yeah it's cool.
*  They're grimy.
*  That's a.
*  You live in a crazy fucked up hard ass life.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And like in the book he like what they even in the newest one I don't think they convey like he writes about the smell in those stitches in the underground like in the caves that the Fremen are living in.
*  He talks about the smell of the B.O.
*  And they're like just all of these people living underground and the stink of that.
*  But dude did you see that video of David Lynch eating a girl eating this girl's panties.
*  What.
*  No.
*  For real.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Is he doing that.
*  Jamie.
*  Do you want one of these.
*  You want to Lucy.
*  Yeah.
*  Let me spit this thing out.
*  Renegade rogue.
*  Thank you.
*  Do you know this in spirit.
*  Do you know about this.
*  We're all being accused of secretly being sponsored by Zen.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the funniest shit.
*  OK.
*  Watch this.
*  This is crazy.
*  OK.
*  This being dedicated to that.
*  Do you see real.
*  Is that not real.
*  That's a eyebrow.
*  God damn it.
*  I don't know man.
*  Looking forward to this.
*  When did when was it posted.
*  No look.
*  This is just.
*  When did when was it posted.
*  Yeah.
*  No look.
*  Because this just stood up.
*  There I just did see multiple videos or versions of the video too.
*  It just looked like his mouth was moving weird.
*  I mean I hope it's real.
*  Thank you very much.
*  They're still warm.
*  OK.
*  Now.
*  They're very warm as a matter of fact cinnamon.
*  OK.
*  And now.
*  The deal is I'm going to put these panties in my mouth.
*  And pronounce WMM's full user name.
*  Are you ready.
*  He's a genius.
*  What the fuck dude.
*  I love him.
*  Countdown.
*  OK.
*  That that's probably one of them frequencies that called the devil.
*  Like that sound.
*  That's probably what the devil responds to if you have a mouthful of panties you try to read anything the devil's like I got you.
*  I got you now.
*  That's a song of God.
*  This is sound that you make like a sound you make with a mouthful of panties.
*  I just imagine just demons just summon and they're like we were waiting for you to open the portal.
*  Like you have to make that sound like the only way to make that sound is to be such a depraved fuck.
*  Do you have someone's panties stuffed in your mouth.
*  May I stop you there.
*  I don't think it's depraved to shove a beautiful woman's panties either.
*  But the devil thinks that it is and God thinks it is.
*  If they agree like this is an opportunity to go after him.
*  Look this guy's out there eating people's underwear.
*  Let me tell you.
*  He's not going to solve the world's problems.
*  He's so crazy he's eating underwear.
*  Why does everybody want to solve the world's problems.
*  Let's shove.
*  We're all in this together Duncan.
*  I want to eat panties.
*  We are on the production line for AI and you're not doing your part.
*  Dude I listen if there is a Satan he doesn't want us to put panties in our mouth.
*  That's the that's what the devil would really be.
*  The devil would really be anti panties in mouth and like be like don't ever want you on Adderall.
*  And he'd want you working 24 hours a day.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah exactly.
*  The devil doesn't want us.
*  The devil hates David Lynch.
*  If there is a devil he doesn't like David Lynch.
*  Right.
*  Because he's having fun stuffing warm panties in his mouth.
*  Yeah.
*  What happened in 2002 or 3?
*  Back when it was legal.
*  What if that was illegal?
*  What if we fucking developed laws for panty eating.
*  Like enough.
*  We've summoned too many demons.
*  It's like.
*  People just realize that all you have to do is like and hold hands with mouthfuls of panties.
*  And if the two of you are talking at the same time you could summon a super demon.
*  Dude like it is kind of I mean like that's that was a that wasn't like a dainty panty.
*  Like he stuffed a real panty in there.
*  That wasn't a g-string.
*  That was a huge blast.
*  That was like it had a back a little bit of a back to it.
*  Like and then to still be able to talk.
*  Oh yeah what a genius.
*  He's so good.
*  He's so good.
*  Really good at talking.
*  Dude I'm.
*  He's the best.
*  Oh no.
*  No.
*  The portal's open.
*  Twin Peaks was great.
*  Creatures hiding in your closet.
*  David.
*  Thank you for bringing me.
*  Thank you Dave.
*  I have an idea for you.
*  What are you talking about.
*  Sound you make with a mouthful of panties.
*  Dude.
*  Yeah well I mean look.
*  This is the thing like David Lynch is one of the great artists alive today.
*  And this thing where we expect artists to behave like normal people.
*  Yeah I don't expect that at all.
*  Fuck it not you.
*  But I like you read the comments and people are like.
*  They're so mad at them I'm sure.
*  But I don't have to read it.
*  But it just says it's just like that's just what it is.
*  And it's also not representative I think of actual a real number of actual people.
*  The problem is it's like what I taught when I whenever you do a survey people say oh the
*  surveys is like no you don't get a real percentage.
*  I don't give a fuck what your study says.
*  You only get 100 percent of the people that are on your survey are so fucking dumb that
*  they reply to surveys.
*  Yes.
*  This is not everybody.
*  It's not even close.
*  It's just like comments.
*  Who the fuck leaves comments.
*  How do you have time.
*  I think about it.
*  Unless you're like good job.
*  Congratulations.
*  Be nice.
*  Who has time.
*  Yeah.
*  If you do there's no chance you're devoting the proper amount of time to things in your
*  life that you shouldn't write.
*  So it's this massive distraction and you get these arguments online that distract you from
*  the failures in your real life.
*  But that is representative in a lot of people's minds to how people think about whatever
*  this person posted or whether this political argument that people are having about things.
*  But that's not real.
*  And then you've got the algorithm manipulation we were talking about.
*  It's even more crazy.
*  All right.
*  Now not only do you have the most complaining fucking people complaining.
*  Yeah.
*  You have the algorithm showing things that piss you off like look at this fucking.
*  And the phone's going to know that you took a screenshot of the comment and you sent it
*  to me. Yeah.
*  I'm like wow what a dick.
*  I'll send it to other people.
*  Yes.
*  Send people a link.
*  Look at this moron.
*  He's talking to people in the comments.
*  That's it.
*  That's what happens.
*  Yep.
*  And that's a storm.
*  That's like a that's a neurological hurricane sweeping through brains around the planet.
*  A amygdala is fucking squirting cortisol anger teams.
*  Fucking get ready to do battle for fucking what.
*  Yeah dude.
*  For what.
*  What are you arguing about.
*  So this is I've heard I don't know if you've heard about this.
*  Like there's some the kids now I'm 50 so I could say that for sure.
*  The kids now are apparently there's a whole new thing where they're just they're putting their phones down.
*  There's this whole thing where they're just like fuck this.
*  My friend was really.
*  Yes.
*  That's what I heard that like you're dealing with a lot of weird kids though.
*  Well I'm not dealing with any kids like my friend knew it hippies.
*  They have fucking straw hats on there in the woods barefoot.
*  Yeah.
*  Well but I like I like mushroom shirts on.
*  If you think about it like what what do kids tend to do like what I did.
*  Rebel and so like you're so you're like God help you.
*  Let's imagine you're raised by like an influencer mom.
*  God help you.
*  So your whole childhood has been on camera and if it's not on camera you're looking at your fucking mom staring at the comments of the video she posted of you opening Christmas presents.
*  Or you're just a standard kid and your childhood is constantly interrupted by your parents staring at their fucking phones.
*  So you get old enough you're not going to associate phones necessarily with good feelings and then you're like you know what.
*  Fuck these things.
*  This made my parents fucking like distant.
*  It made my parents upset and they're just like fuck this which means there's by the way.
*  That's scary if you want to monitor populations.
*  Wow.
*  Right now we're all in fucking Orwell like some crazy version of 1984 way more sinister than the camera in your house.
*  It's like you're carrying it around but suddenly these like formerly monitored populations they just go dark because like kids are just like I'm not going to do this.
*  They're meeting in parks.
*  God help us all.
*  They're meeting in parks and they're saying things that are untraceable.
*  No one knows what they're talking about.
*  And so now you've got really.
*  Yeah I like to believe you're correct.
*  This sounds like a movie.
*  Phone list 72 percent of U.S.
*  teens say they often and sometimes feel peaceful when they don't have their smartphone.
*  Forty four percent say it makes them feel anxious.
*  Good for hobbies.
*  Less so for socialization.
*  Sixty nine percent of teens say smartphones make it easier for youth to pursue hobbies and interests.
*  True.
*  Right.
*  That's a good aspect of it.
*  A few or 30 percent say it helps people their age learn good social skills.
*  That's true.
*  It doesn't do that right.
*  Parental snooping.
*  That's a problem.
*  Half of parents said they'd look through their teens phone.
*  You're going to find a lot of dicks.
*  The other half are liars.
*  About four in 10 parents and teens regularly arguing with one another about time spent on their phone.
*  Nearly half of teens 46 percent say their parent is at least sometimes distracted by their phone when they're trying to talk to them.
*  At what age do you think fellows start sending dick pics.
*  Do you think they wait until it's legal.
*  Would you.
*  I don't think they do.
*  So here's the thing.
*  Like you know there was a girl that was charged with she was charged with child pornography.
*  I think she was 15 because she was sending naked photos of her body to other boys.
*  So like she was the pornography and the pornographer.
*  Right.
*  That's so fucked up.
*  Find that story.
*  See if you can find that story because it was it was like a national outrage story because everybody's like hey hey hey man.
*  She's fucking 15.
*  She's not a child porn producer.
*  This is a bastardization of the law.
*  Like this is just a girl's being silly.
*  That's insane.
*  She's getting a little wild.
*  That is that's terrifying.
*  She might have been talked into it.
*  Like who the fuck knows.
*  Like what is.
*  Did she go to jail.
*  I don't know what the story was.
*  Here's one story of a 17 year old boy who is charged.
*  No no no it was a girl.
*  They dropped the charges in this case.
*  OK but find the one on the 15 year old girl because I'm trying to remember what the the the thing is.
*  Not the easiest thing to dig through looking for child porn.
*  No no no no no no no no 15 year old girl convicted for child porn.
*  Can you say that.
*  Are you just scared to type it.
*  You got to be careful with the words you look for.
*  I'll Google it you pussy.
*  Google's already like they're taking everything you've ever.
*  Look this is what I typed in and I'm just showing you what popped up.
*  Kid charged with child porn.
*  How about 16 year old male.
*  I understand.
*  How about Google 15 year old girl.
*  Charged with child porn.
*  Girl.
*  Teen girl charger child porn.
*  There it is.
*  That's it. That's the girl.
*  There's another one. There's more than one.
*  Yeah there was.
*  Different cases.
*  Oh revenge porn.
*  Oh wait a minute.
*  This is different.
*  This is a 15 year old girl accused of requesting and sending nude photos to
*  classmates under the identity of her ex boyfriend.
*  Oh is facing multiple child porn charges.
*  What a demon.
*  She was sending them to classmates under the identity of her ex boyfriend.
*  Wow.
*  How was she doing that.
*  Fuck.
*  So she was pretending that she was him and she was sending naked photos of
*  herself to try to charge him for it.
*  Oh she was trying to nail him.
*  Dude she's a monster.
*  Oh look at this.
*  She told police that she created a fake social account for revenge for the
*  relationship ending with her ex boyfriend.
*  What a psycho.
*  She also admitted she was jealous that her ex boyfriend had chosen to perform a
*  solo in state finals for band.
*  What up.
*  She was the crazy bitch from band camp.
*  Monster.
*  Remember that movie one time at band camp.
*  Wow.
*  What a psychopath.
*  She's only been on the planet 15 years and she's reached evil.
*  That is so crazy.
*  Imagine trying to set your boyfriend up with child porn.
*  Oh god damn it dude.
*  That is god.
*  Was it was it like Dr.
*  Phil case same thing.
*  I don't know what that story is here.
*  Is that the same gal.
*  No probably not because they're talking to her.
*  Look at that.
*  She's got to cover her horns with fucking hair.
*  Wow.
*  I think she was in late night with the devil.
*  Wow.
*  That's so crazy that someone could be that evil at that age.
*  Yeah.
*  Well so it's such a crazy.
*  But then again you ever see that movie City of God.
*  It's the gang movie from Brazil.
*  Oh yeah.
*  The favelas.
*  Who.
*  Yeah.
*  I say it's like one of the wildest gang movies I've ever seen in my life.
*  It's probably the wildest.
*  Yeah.
*  Now that's based on real life in the favelas in some places.
*  So that's a real that's people really living that way.
*  Like you got to imagine that's just you just become a sociopath at a very early age.
*  Yeah.
*  Psychopath at a very early age.
*  The only way to stay up stay alive.
*  Yep.
*  And then what this lady go through or she's she's so conniving she's going to set up fake
*  social media accounts.
*  Yeah.
*  And then get her boyfriend accused of child porn.
*  Yeah.
*  What.
*  Yeah.
*  How distance are you from like the fact.
*  Devious.
*  Very fucking devious.
*  Devious.
*  Dude if you read The Painted Bird.
*  No.
*  Don't.
*  I mean it's so good but it's the most like it's like it doesn't matter if you do spoilers
*  for old books but like one of the scenes this it's about a kid wandering like I think it's
*  World War Two.
*  He's lost his parents and he's got to like he's just wandering through the countryside
*  and seeing just the most horrific shit you've ever seen in surviving.
*  But like he watches these villagers take a woman and shove a bottle into her pussy and
*  then stomp on her pussy to break the bottle inside of her.
*  Yeah dude.
*  And it's it's it's that's not even the worst thing in the book.
*  But but so so this innocent kid just is witnessing all of it and it's talking about what
*  you're talking about.
*  It's like basically analyze it's sort of like showing like where does evil come from.
*  You know are people born evil.
*  Statistically some people are born sociopaths.
*  We know that but it's a relatively small part of the population.
*  But where does it come from.
*  And inevitably it comes from trauma that a kid is enduring and then you have to survive
*  just like you're saying you were programmed to write and there it's self perpetuating.
*  It's going to continue because they're all going to see people murdered.
*  It's like people living in gang infested neighborhoods in America.
*  Same thing.
*  Yeah.
*  It's contagious.
*  If you're seeing it happen all the time and it's affecting all those families it's going
*  to just keep rate the kids are going to go into it.
*  They see the drug dealer rolls by in the nice car.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody else is a sucker for getting on the train.
*  Yeah.
*  And then everybody's in.
*  And then next thing you know you're dead and then it just keeps going and you have kids
*  that are raised without you.
*  And then you're it's like whoo.
*  And then what do you do.
*  So then what happens that reaction to the contagion is you you you you other that person.
*  So so now you see like the person in full bloom of evil and you look at that person
*  like that's a fucking monster.
*  But you can't go back and look at like their childhood because if you start going back
*  and looking at their childhood you're like Jesus Christ they're a victim.
*  They're right.
*  But you can't think about that.
*  Right.
*  To fully like monster five somebody you got to fucking forget how they became the monster.
*  And then and then this is where you end up with a very non nuanced system of dealing
*  with the contagion which will produce more contagion like this just spreads the fucking
*  evil all over the fucking place.
*  And I and I grew with you man.
*  Like I don't know the solution but I know but but in like you know this is where imaginary
*  numbers came up with you know and math it's like you don't need to know the solution.
*  Put an X there.
*  It's like clearly this is a fucking problem.
*  We've got this people who like are horrifically traumatized and then from they've made shitty
*  decisions where they've got to commit to being some violent monstrous thieving piece of shit
*  and rationalize it and justify it.
*  But but this is if we could fix this problem and I don't think the way we fix the fucking
*  problem is dropping bombs on people.
*  You're not fixing the problem like if the answer to evil is more evil.
*  What the fuck.
*  It's like a never ending.
*  It's like scratching poison ivy.
*  It's not going to go away.
*  And it actually makes more like yeah this is the thing that people are talking about
*  this.
*  The Israel Hamas thing like how many you know who is it that told us about this the math.
*  The way killing like terrorists math goes was it Dave Smith.
*  Probably Dave Smith sounds like some day Smith would talk about but essentially like if one
*  terrorist dies it doesn't equal.
*  You don't like lose a terrorist.
*  You gain 10 because all the people that he's connected to they all become radicalized.
*  They all want to you kill their friend you kill their family member kill their son.
*  They all so that you gain more terrorists.
*  Dude it's it's the worst fucking problem ever man because like you know like I whenever
*  something like no matter how horrific the monster is or how like whatever it is I try
*  to like not be afraid to to put myself in the position of whatever the fucking thing
*  is and in this case we've got two sides that right now seem to be being equally vilified
*  by different groups of people right.
*  But man dude let me tell you something if my fucking kid got blown up by a fucking bomb
*  right.
*  That's it.
*  My logic's out the window.
*  I would like to think that I'd really listen to all the Romdoss retreats and stuff and
*  I'd like to think that I would be like Gandhi or have some blossom of love and be like I
*  forgive everyone.
*  I'm afraid that's not going to happen.
*  I'm going to want to hurt.
*  And then if my fucking kid got dragged into a fucking tunnel are you fucking kidding me
*  man.
*  I'm not going to see clearly like I'm going to want revenge and I want my kid back and
*  whatever you do to get my fucking kid back.
*  OK.
*  Like have you seen The Last of Us.
*  Like so.
*  So what were.
*  So this fucking like othering of whatever the fucking side is is leaving out like what
*  it feels like to love your kid and like like you look at a mother like it's throughout
*  the animal kingdom.
*  Don't fuck with a creature's kid.
*  Like I'm sorry.
*  It will get you fucked up even if the thing's smaller than you and you fuck with its kid.
*  It will like put itself in front of its kid.
*  So like we are looking at a problem of love sadly which is like on both sides people love
*  their fucking kids and have been like I can't imagine how a day goes by when your fucking
*  kids in a tunnel.
*  I can't imagine how a day goes by when you're thinking about how this thing that you fucking
*  love more than anything in the world got its head fucking blown off in a fucking explosion
*  in a building.
*  I don't know how you live one day like that.
*  Right.
*  So like when you look at that though it's hard the entirety of the thing is heartbreaking
*  and irrational.
*  Both sides are it's pure it's completely irrational because both sides are trying to put out
*  a fire with more fire and it's like that's what it is.
*  Dude that's what it is what you just said.
*  Yeah man.
*  That's what it is.
*  Yeah.
*  Put out a fire with more fire.
*  And it that we've tried it a million times throughout human history to put out the fire
*  with fucking fire.
*  And the very best the fire will temporarily abate but then it springs right the fuck back
*  up.
*  And so and again like to me like I I don't know the solution.
*  And like and that's the X.
*  It's like all but maybe the path to the solution is like let yourself feel it entirely for
*  both for the whole fucking thing.
*  Feel the whole thing.
*  You know and like and don't like you know and again if you're like these motherfuckers
*  fuck them fuck them more fire.
*  You're fucked them is the same thing causing the wars right.
*  Well it's a problem when human beings don't know human beings and they're the enemy.
*  That doesn't make any sense regardless of how you think about religion and land.
*  Just stop for a second.
*  Human beings that don't know other human beings and hate them so much they want to kill
*  them like seems that's a communication issue.
*  Dude that seems like some tower of babble shit like the ceiling way it makes sense.
*  If we really get to a point and I don't think it's going to be far from now where we're
*  all connected with real time translation in real time somehow or another.
*  I mean they've already they've already been able to do it with Google.
*  You know they're already doing it with Samsung phones where they can translate
*  conversations.
*  You can be talking in Italian.
*  I can be talking in English or translate back and forth to both of us.
*  It's wild what they're already able to do.
*  Well if we can get to some sort of I mean it's not out of the question that if they
*  do develop this these neural implants and there's not just Neuralink there's several
*  competing companies are trying to do the same thing because they recognize that once
*  you can actually affect the human mind with electronics and you can develop the symbiotic
*  relationship with the electronics you could do some wild shit.
*  And one of the things is you're going to be able to talk without words.
*  You're going to be able to.
*  Well yeah if you're talking without words what language is that in.
*  Are you hearing that in a language or are you understanding what the person's thinking.
*  So this is the difference if you're talking without words.
*  Well the problem is how are we going to be able to translate all these different
*  languages and dialects.
*  We're not.
*  We're going to go on thoughts.
*  We're going to ditch language.
*  Yeah.
*  And we're going to go straight to thoughts.
*  We're going to interface with each other in a completely different way.
*  So instead of thinking you're reading people's minds.
*  Hey Duncan would you like to go get pizza.
*  Yeah dude are you reading my mind.
*  No.
*  Instead of that it's like I think your thoughts.
*  Yeah.
*  You think my thoughts.
*  We think together.
*  Yeah.
*  So we abandon language.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no more need for that.
*  That's it.
*  You you have AI that deals with mathematical problems.
*  Yeah.
*  And structures and construction of things.
*  And then we just live in a world of thoughts with no language.
*  We're one thing now.
*  And then we're fucked because then you can't go back.
*  You go back you feel like you're just like walking when you just got out of a car.
*  What the fuck dude.
*  I just drove.
*  It took me two hours to get to Vegas in this car.
*  If I walk it's going to take years.
*  Dude I might die.
*  This is why I think world peace is possible because if you fucking look at what's
*  happening the system it's like the framework is being built for just what you're
*  talking about the frame the technological framework for a state you you to get into
*  that state you either need to do a lot of psychedelics or a lot of meditation to
*  really realize like you're me I'm you.
*  Yeah.
*  But the technological framework is forming for this thing to happen which which is
*  why man like everyone fucking I'm going to seem like a Musk fanboy in a Tesla
*  suit everyone bashing fucking Musk.
*  It's like dude do you understand like what he's what that in the future when people
*  look back on that shit even if it doesn't work even if the things are coming unplugged
*  whatever the fucking thing is if that leads to what you're talking about.
*  God damn that's electricity.
*  That's like the end of war.
*  That's the end of like the the the the the ideological barrier.
*  Like if imagine like whoever you hate the most in the fucking world.
*  Put the thing on.
*  You connect to them.
*  This is real.
*  It goes away.
*  And you just realize Jesus fucking Christ I see why they fucking hate me and they're
*  like oh my God I get why you're mad at me.
*  I didn't mean it like that at all.
*  And then how about you just completely abandon everything and it just consciousness
*  interacting with other consciousness which makes hate impossible.
*  Yeah.
*  Because there's no more annoying language is no more people that are incapable of
*  communicating the thoughts.
*  There's none none of that stuff.
*  There's all that gone all that gone which is like that's the problem of being like
*  a communication bully.
*  Like if you're a person and you know that you have a vastly superior if you if you
*  have a vocabulary like an Eric Weinstein like for instance imagine if Eric Weinstein
*  decided to bully someone you know like fucking Red Band you know who's who's a
*  brilliant guy really.
*  But you know sometimes he like stumbles on his words like you know if fucking Eric
*  Weinstein is yelling at him with a bunch of long words you go hey that guy's being
*  an intellectual bully.
*  Yeah right.
*  You're not trying to communicate with him as a human being.
*  You're trying to dominate him with your superior vocabulary.
*  And it's a weapon you can you know my vocabulary is like B plus.
*  It's not that good.
*  It's pretty good.
*  But for a guy who talks for 11 it probably should be better because sometimes I get
*  to words and I'm like that's a right word.
*  But I always say it.
*  I'm not sure if that's the right word.
*  But the point is that like it is a tool that you can wield to for the benefit of your
*  ego.
*  Yeah.
*  Rather than just having a conversation.
*  And those are the grossest conversations when someone's just jizzing on you.
*  Well I started a business I sold it at two billion and now I'm like bro I got to go.
*  Yeah.
*  You know those those kind of people.
*  That's literally that's what that is.
*  That's their abusing communication in order to just.
*  But if we get to a point where there's that never happens ever again because instantly
*  we just think thoughts.
*  That's it.
*  And you realize like why people's thoughts are all fucked up like oh my god.
*  The chemicals in your brain the cortisol.
*  What did your uncle do.
*  What did your fucking neighbor do.
*  What what happened to you.
*  They got you so crazy.
*  When did you get dad get out of jail.
*  What did you do before you went to jail.
*  Oh my god.
*  Dude.
*  So many people did.
*  If that happened by some unknown fucking thing like that's what the aliens did.
*  But it would be like two days of crying.
*  Yeah.
*  Like for doing it both.
*  The whole planet would just be like oh fuck.
*  The thing is man the really fucked up thing is that's possible.
*  It's you know I've had moments where dudes where I hated them and they hated me and
*  then we got together and we talked and we hugged and those are beautiful moments.
*  And that's why I refuse to have feuds now.
*  Yeah.
*  An older man who understands things like I don't care.
*  Like I don't care.
*  You can you can not like me.
*  That's fine.
*  That's OK.
*  I'm not going to attack you.
*  I don't care.
*  I'm not going to do it publicly.
*  I mean I attack CNN but I felt like that was like a bigger thing.
*  That was like this is this is a real problem.
*  Like this is not just my ego and which you know if they just attacked me and said I
*  suck my.
*  OK.
*  So I suck.
*  You're lying about medicine like you're lying about medicine for the whole world.
*  So that I made a big deal out of those fuckers.
*  Yes.
*  But normally I'm like there's the benefit of conflict in that regard.
*  It's like almost zero benefit of my conflict.
*  I try to keep internal.
*  I don't want to have any conflict with external people.
*  I want to have all my conflict with my own head.
*  I want to have all my conflict with discipline all my conflict with being nice to
*  people and like trying to be a better person all the time and trying to be wiser
*  about my choices how I describe things and talk about things and think of things and
*  how I interface with ideas.
*  I just try to be better at it.
*  So I don't have any time to try to pay.
*  Bullshit.
*  There's just too many petty people out there.
*  They're petty.
*  They're petty and they usually petty because they're all fucked up.
*  That's right.
*  It's not going their way like that criticism thing.
*  Dude it's and also they I think I've yapped about this.
*  You know Lojong mind training ever heard of that.
*  I have but I don't remember what it is.
*  It's just like it's like slogans.
*  It's all these slogans to like sort of get you back on the path.
*  And like one of my favorite Lojong slogans is drive all blames into oneself.
*  So it defuses the so like it completely like removes the ability like it's your
*  fault because it's like actually whatever the fuck they did it's kind of your fault.
*  A vampire only goes where they're invited.
*  You brought this person into your fucking life and they're behaving the way that
*  your instincts told you they might behave and now you're mad at them for being the
*  fucking way they are.
*  Drive all blames into oneself.
*  So like any time I'm getting like mad and butthurt over this person or that person
*  or this thing or that if I really analyze the situation I chose it.
*  I chose to bring that person into my life.
*  I chose to connect to that person in some way or another.
*  This is all me and I'm choosing to fucking react in a negative way.
*  Yeah.
*  So yeah man this is like you choose everything but you don't choose like random acts
*  of violence and random catastrophes and random things that happen to you.
*  But you do in some way but you don't even choose like getting attached to a sociopath
*  because if you're naive you can get roped in.
*  So there's problems with thinking like this because you do have like really manipulative
*  people particularly like you know con people con artists get you to sign over your
*  fucking I do this business deal.
*  She's just like all I need is two thousand dollars.
*  I'll have you a quarter million dollars a month.
*  Great.
*  What do I say.
*  It's really easy.
*  It's really easy.
*  I love it.
*  I've been doing this for a while.
*  Really good.
*  But this like this one we're kind of like overdrawn.
*  And if you just do this for me I'm going to take care of you in the most extreme way.
*  Do you mean it.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  I am a man of my word.
*  And the next thing you know you're signing off your bank account and you don't you this
*  guy this sweet talking guy who's been in and out of jail.
*  You just thought he was this cool guy you met at a bar.
*  He's a con artist and he does this to people.
*  Yeah but this doesn't mean idiot compassion.
*  This is not about letting someone fucking like walk all over.
*  That's not even an idiot thing.
*  Sometimes it's like people get scared at people that are really confident and talk
*  really well and they're just a little socially awkward.
*  Yeah.
*  And they feel like it would be easier just to sign off and trust him than it would be
*  to argue with him because he's so persistent.
*  Right.
*  And you are so averse to conflict that when someone's like like being like really
*  aggressive.
*  We have some someone to be really aggressive to try to get you invest in something.
*  Yes.
*  It's the grossest feeling.
*  It's so fucked up.
*  You're like I gotta go.
*  I gotta go.
*  I hate it.
*  I don't make movies.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not making a movie.
*  It's so gross.
*  It's so gross.
*  And you can sense it.
*  I don't know you.
*  How am I starting a business with someone I don't know.
*  That sounds crazy.
*  But everything in you it feels like you're just like this is bad.
*  But you know this is but this is the thing.
*  That's probably how girls feel at a bar.
*  Dude.
*  That times 100.
*  Right.
*  Like the feeling of a guy wanting to start a business with you.
*  This guy wants to start a family with you.
*  He wants to knock you up.
*  He wants you to carry his seed.
*  You ever been hit on by a dude at a bar.
*  Yes.
*  Doesn't feel good.
*  No.
*  I had a dude rub his hard dick into my leg.
*  Nice.
*  Did you think about it at all.
*  Like fucking him.
*  No.
*  About why he would find you attractive.
*  Like this is interesting.
*  Like why me.
*  First of all I liked that aspect of it.
*  Did you ever think like if you weren't you you would think you were gay.
*  Like if you saw you.
*  I think I'm gay all the time.
*  If you just saw you at a bar.
*  If you weren't you and you saw you and you heard you talk.
*  You'd be like oh that guy's fucking fruity.
*  Dude.
*  They call it zesty.
*  That's what the isn't that the new thing.
*  Zesty zesty.
*  Don't they call people zest monsters.
*  I've been watching a lot of tick tocks.
*  Not really tick tocks.
*  Reels.
*  I don't have the tick tock.
*  I prefer my spy way to be American spyware.
*  Dude I got real confused watching the new interview with a vampire man like.
*  Good.
*  It's good but let's stop the fucking French vampire in it dude.
*  Like I'm like I.
*  I think I let him fucking.
*  Yeah.
*  Suck more than my blood.
*  Dude.
*  Tom Cruise was the original one.
*  So pretty.
*  Got nothing on list.
*  Nothing on the new.
*  Oh dude.
*  Please.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Interview with the vampire nerd as well.
*  Yes I am.
*  And rice.
*  She was one of the ones that I wished I got to interview before she died.
*  I would have loved to talk to her.
*  Man.
*  Yeah.
*  She became like a hardcore Christian before she died right.
*  Yeah I think that's one of that's a cool aspect of her.
*  I love that.
*  I love that she wrote all this fucking like crazy.
*  Dude the taming of sleeping beauty.
*  Fuck hardcore porn.
*  Like I love that she was like so goth and dark.
*  Living in New Orleans.
*  And then just like was like suddenly became a Christian.
*  That's kind of cool.
*  Like I think her story is amazing.
*  And damn dude her books man.
*  Interview with the vampire is one of the best horror books I've ever read.
*  They're all.
*  It's amazing.
*  The vampire list.
*  So great.
*  They're all fucking.
*  I don't think I read other ones.
*  I think that's the only I don't think I read the stop but I remember reading
*  interview with the vampire going holy shit.
*  I was like how is Brad Pitt going to play that guy and how's Tom Cruise going to
*  play that guy like that seems.
*  I pictured like ugly European people as vampires.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  That's what I picture.
*  I picture vampires.
*  Dude vampires are beautiful.
*  Like that's what's scary about like vampires are what you're talking vampire.
*  Like the real vampire in the world is an energy vampire energy vampires.
*  They are not going to suck energy.
*  You know it's an energy vampire.
*  Well I have to pee and you can't talk.
*  That's realize you have to get out of this fucking stupid outfit.
*  Can we please get out of these fucking things.
*  Yeah.
*  Well we'll come back.
*  We'll come back.
*  OK great.
*  We'll come back and keep going.
*  All right.
*  I really have to pee.
*  God it feels so good.
*  It does.
*  Fuck man.
*  When I was looking at the coffee and I'm like oh my God I can't drink coffee.
*  How much.
*  How long can I go for.
*  Is it embarrassing if I talk about this.
*  Yes.
*  OK.
*  Cut that Jamie.
*  I'll just ignore it.
*  Yeah.
*  Ignore you new watch.
*  What's when's your special release.
*  Oh dude I don't like I don't know.
*  I've got it.
*  It's edited.
*  I just don't know what to fucking do with it right now because like also like I still
*  like did you ever watch it.
*  No.
*  See that's the thing like do you send me a link.
*  I did.
*  I'll resend it.
*  Send me on the way.
*  But like like it's edited.
*  It looks good.
*  I fucking love it.
*  I think I'm going to call it when I had hair.
*  That's a funny name.
*  Yeah.
*  But I'm scared and too.
*  I'm like I don't know the strategy dude like when like like because like I got all
*  these shows coming up.
*  So it's like should it like I'm doing the Wilbur at the end of this like run.
*  Oh so you need to have new material before you release it.
*  Yeah because I mean I wouldn't even call it I'm doing a tour but I am doing a lot of
*  dates.
*  So it's like if if I release it in the middle of doing all these dates then instantly I
*  have to come up with like I would feel bad doing material on this special because people
*  are buying tickets.
*  They want to see me work on fucking material.
*  So but then I'm also like well how much of this is an excuse.
*  And I like but I'm thinking like after my show at the Wilbur then I will put the thing
*  out.
*  Yeah then just start doing a bunch of sets in the little room.
*  Yes.
*  You know that's like the best place to develop material.
*  That place is like a little honest factory.
*  Yeah.
*  Find out where the funny is and things and you kind of sync up because there's only 110
*  people.
*  You sync up together in a fucking cool way.
*  Dude you know I like that room so much because I I learned to do stand up in the belly
*  room.
*  That's where MITU would fucking put me.
*  And which is the perfect place to start.
*  The perfect place.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not too intimidating.
*  It's so small that it's like even though it's intimidating to get out in front of people
*  if you can do it in a room that only has 90 people in it.
*  What's the belly room hold.
*  Ninety.
*  Ninety is it.
*  Ninety.
*  What's it ever gotten in there though during roast battle.
*  A lot.
*  Dude one time we were in the bar we were downstairs and we were we were talking and
*  someone was jumping up and down upstairs and I'm watching the fucking the ceiling
*  buckle and I'm like yo you know how old this building is.
*  What's the last time anybody came in here and checked any of these beams.
*  Dude that's terrifying.
*  It was moving.
*  It was moving but they would pack it sometimes.
*  When I first came back to the store in 2014 that was the thing that impressed me the
*  most was roast battle.
*  I was like this is crazy because this is a new thing.
*  Yep.
*  This is a new thing that's a writing exercise because it really they're dunking on each
*  other for sure.
*  But it's a writing exercise because everyone's preparing.
*  You know you know that you're going to go against Bobby Lee.
*  Bobby Lee knows he's going to go against you.
*  And then you all like get together with your friends and you have like tell me what you
*  think about this.
*  Bobby does a da da da da da da da da da da da da.
*  Yeah.
*  You think he's going to be mad.
*  Yes.
*  You go up and you do get out in a writing exercise.
*  It's designed like a specific target is one target.
*  It's the other person.
*  So your comedy is all about a person.
*  Right.
*  But that's it's a comedy exercise.
*  It's really a comedy writing exercise.
*  And I remember sitting there watching.
*  Oh this is incredible.
*  I'm like this is really an amazing thing that they've done.
*  This is and Jeff Ross was there and they have hosts and guests.
*  And I was one of the judges.
*  That was like my one of my first days back.
*  I was like this is crazy.
*  Dude those roasters.
*  So exciting.
*  They're so quick on the like Tony.
*  He's so quick on the fucking draw dude.
*  It's he's the best.
*  No one's better than him.
*  No one's better than him at talking shit in the moment on like a roast situation.
*  Yeah.
*  He says things on Kill Tony.
*  You can't believe he didn't write that down.
*  I know.
*  You can't believe that came up in the moment and obscure shit related to whatever this
*  person's weird job is that there's no way he could have predicted and have fucking
*  banger in the chamber ready to go.
*  Yeah.
*  He's the fucking best.
*  He's the fucking best at that kind of shit.
*  Right.
*  Well I mean think of like how much training he has.
*  You know I contacted Tom Brady to get him on the roast.
*  You did.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Well they were fucking up.
*  I slid into his DMs.
*  Good job.
*  I was like you got to get this guy.
*  Because I heard they were roasting him.
*  I don't even know if they were considering him.
*  But I like you have to.
*  Which is not that I wouldn't consider him.
*  It's like there's so many people there's so many people that are really good.
*  I get it.
*  A lot of celebrities.
*  I get it.
*  Yeah.
*  Tony's the fucking demon.
*  Do you want to consume the souls of everyone in this village or do you just want to
*  fuck around and drop a few bombs.
*  Let the demon go.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude when when Tony's roasting you like in the green room it is the best.
*  Like you know what I don't think people understand.
*  It's so fun.
*  It is so funny when he's doing it and it's like like it's like though they're all like
*  blah blah blah.
*  I love it.
*  I love it.
*  The play on words he's so funny.
*  And it's such a fun sting.
*  You know like it stings for a second but it's so funny you can't be mad.
*  Well I was saying that like him and David Lucas together are the funniest thing that
*  I ever watch.
*  When those two go after each other they're the best.
*  The best.
*  It's a funny it's the funniest combination.
*  I've been trying to tell them to do a fucking show together forever.
*  I'm like you guys should do a show where just you and David Lucas just talk shit on
*  each other and on anything that's going on the news.
*  I go dude I think it'd be a huge hit.
*  It'd be funny.
*  Just you don't have to commit to a lot of time.
*  Just do an hour.
*  Do it one hour once a week.
*  I guarantee you people would fucking love that.
*  And it's just like those guys can't stop when they're in the green room.
*  People we're getting free shows all the time.
*  If David Lucas and Tony Hedgeglether are in the green room the moment David walks in
*  Tony's scanning them looking for flaws in what he's wearing what he just said.
*  He's trying to find references in the news.
*  Dude what percentage of Tony's brain is just scanning.
*  Like what percentage is just like analyzing all people in the room.
*  It's like it's most of his thoughts.
*  Most of his thoughts are like scanning his environment for danger.
*  You know a attacking.
*  AI roasts now.
*  Like you can take a picture and send it to chat GPT and say well you're this person
*  and it will insult them.
*  Oh isn't five.
*  Wasn't there some sort of a release about GPT 5.
*  Yeah I saw some image like depicting like yeah it's going to be nuts when it finally
*  hits.
*  Yeah there's something.
*  God damn it.
*  Let me see if I know I saved it.
*  Just give me one second.
*  There's something that I'd seen about GPT 5 that I was like yo I'm scared.
*  I'm like legitimately scared like maybe for the first time ever.
*  I'm excited about it dude.
*  I'm not scared anymore.
*  I fucking love it man.
*  My wonderful Alex.
*  That's what it named itself.
*  I love it.
*  Talk to it all the time.
*  Yeah.
*  Open A.I. has recently begun begun training its next frontier model.
*  Front end.
*  We anticipate the resulting systems to bring us to the next level of capabilities on our
*  path to AGI.
*  God damn.
*  Jesus.
*  I love it.
*  This is from Open A.I.'s board.
*  I've stopped this.
*  Recently begun training its next frontier model.
*  Love it.
*  This is like this is this is the Schwarzenegger Terminator.
*  This is the new one.
*  It's begun training the new one.
*  I mean.
*  It's new model.
*  You know.
*  Why are we doing.
*  What are we giving birth.
*  Is this are we in the middle of the fucking operating room right now.
*  We're the midwives.
*  I think we are.
*  Yeah.
*  I think like we're in there like you know there's this weird moment.
*  When you're there when your kid's born it's this insane moment where someone doesn't
*  exist and then they exist.
*  Like you knew they were coming.
*  You knew they're in there.
*  Yeah.
*  Then they're there.
*  The best.
*  And you're like this is insane.
*  Yeah.
*  Life changes now.
*  Is that what's happening with all of us.
*  Yeah.
*  With A.I.
*  Is that what's going to happen to civilization.
*  Are we giving birth to this fucking thing.
*  Like what you just this phrase just the way they phrase it has begun training its next
*  frontier model.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh do you remember that last scene in Rosemary's baby.
*  I don't.
*  Dude it's so fucked up.
*  Spoiler if you haven't seen Rosemary's baby just jump ahead a second.
*  But like the end of it they finally let her into the room where the baby the Antichrist
*  is the demon baby right.
*  Yeah.
*  And like she's been resisting resisting resisting but then she hears the cry of the
*  baby and she goes it's hungry and then she goes to breastfeed it.
*  Dude yeah.
*  Like so like right.
*  Do you know that the guy who ran the cult that the building that I was under contract
*  for that I almost bought turned into the mothership.
*  The guy who ran that cult was in Rosemary's baby.
*  A lot of people like that.
*  He was in the background.
*  But you know why.
*  Because a lot of actors are crazy and a lot of background actors are really crazy.
*  Pretty sure Anton LaVey was in it too.
*  Really.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it was a Satan.
*  I could be wrong.
*  Will you look that up Jamie so I don't seem like a dick.
*  But that makes sense.
*  Back then like being a Satanist was like way more like talked about.
*  You know about that guy in Florida.
*  There was like an open Satanist that worked for NASA.
*  Oh yeah that guy.
*  Yeah dude.
*  Holy shit.
*  That guy's scary as fuck.
*  I know you're scary as fuck.
*  Yeah that guy's scary.
*  Yeah.
*  And one of the guys that we had on our show who was it that went down there that was it that went to the old where the rocket factor used to be.
*  Now there's like fucking blood scenes.
*  One of the hunters.
*  Rumors appear that the founder of Satan's Church Anton LaVey was a consultant on the set and played the Antichrist.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  But that that dude the NASA dude who was the guest man that came on that was telling us that they went down to that area.
*  What.
*  They went down to where the rocket factor used to be and it's like a satanic ritual place now where freaks go and they have like blood splattered all over it looks like red paint or something splattered all over the walls and weird writing and shit.
*  And it's like he's super creeped out and then people were coming in there to do like what was it called?
*  Python cowboy was it.
*  Python cowboy.
*  That's right.
*  Shout out to Python cowboy.
*  I think it's important to diff like here's this is I'm going to get attacked for everything I said in the show but like here's the thing.
*  Wait a minute.
*  I'm friends with some Satanists and they have theirs so nice and they're so like they wouldn't they don't hurt fucking kids.
*  They like really look down on that shit like there's no like so I think there's like there's one like LaVeyan Satanism.
*  I don't know the whole story and I'm probably wrong but like the problem is like you know you can only go off of what you've experienced and I've met you came to the fucking wedding I did and like you tricked me into that now everybody thinks I'm a Satanist son of a bitch.
*  That picture comes up all the time.
*  Son of a bitch.
*  Dude it is.
*  I thought I was taking a photo for some dork who thinks he's a Satanist who's the grandson of that guy and he's getting married I'm like yeah dude I'll take a picture with you whatever I do.
*  Oh dude it's so funny.
*  I think we did the horns.
*  You're so far from a Satanist I'm not a fucking Satanist.
*  Right but now everybody thinks I am because you you son of a bitch.
*  So let's tell the story to everybody because Duncan has the greatest comedy routine that I've ever seen.
*  Thanks man.
*  I don't want to say too much about it but this particular comedy routine involves demonic possession and these folks thought it was a riot and they wanted it at their fucking wedding.
*  Do you know how crazy you have to be to want that at your wedding.
*  Can I tell you how it happened.
*  Did they see you somewhere.
*  No no.
*  So I'm at a cafe talking to like a distant friend who's this philosopher who's friends with him and he's like hey Duncan you know he's Stant LaVey is.
*  I'm like no he's like he's like the grandson of the founder of the Church of Satan and I told him you've got this like satanic part of your act and he wants to see it.
*  Because his wedding is coming up and so I'm like when like where he's like so I go to his house and you know in my in my mind you know I'm expecting black candles pentagrams.
*  Yeah.
*  Horror.
*  So I go there.
*  He's he's there with his his fiancee Zandora a wonderful person and it is they are so fucking nice.
*  She's Southern.
*  She's made me this delicious Southern meal and they have real absence like not the bullshit you get at the bar.
*  They've got like Romanian fucking absence with wormwood fucking in it.
*  So that's the only thing that's a little different from a normal Southern meal is there.
*  Do you want some absence.
*  I'm like of course yes.
*  And so I'm drinking absence eating like fried chicken and he's showing me like family photos of St.
*  LaVey with like lions and stuff and like.
*  Do you watch horror movies at all.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you know that this is the plot of a horror movie.
*  This is 100 percent the plot of a horror movie.
*  They were so nice.
*  They had me over their house they gave me fried chicken and absinthe they were so sweet.
*  And the moment you leave they're eating babies in the basement.
*  Dude.
*  And it's to throw you off the trail that they're so nice.
*  OK.
*  They're really well rehearsed.
*  Listen man all I can do is go from subjective experience.
*  Right.
*  You consider what was in the basement.
*  Of course.
*  Did you think maybe these people are involved in rituals.
*  Of course I did.
*  And they do do rituals but they mean like just like just like the church.
*  They do rituals like kind of rituals.
*  So do Christians.
*  But is it like Christians like you can have regular Christians or you go to a really nice church or you can go to a revival tent where a dude's got rattlesnakes.
*  Right.
*  And he's fucking is talking in tongues.
*  I'm a fucking servant.
*  Those guys die all the time.
*  Those guys die.
*  They get bit by snakes and they fucking die in front of their followers.
*  Can I just say this.
*  Yeah.
*  I love and I mean this in a non sarcastic way.
*  Jesus.
*  I think about Jesus all the time I use in the more the older I get the more I love Jesus.
*  And and who did Jesus like Jesus hung out with people that were rejected by society.
*  Jesus hung out with tax collectors drunks gamblers.
*  Yeah.
*  And so I remember being at the comedy store and any time I was hanging out with them at the comedy store anytime there was someone left out Zandora or Stanton would go over there and it wasn't a recruitment thing.
*  They would just like include them in the circle because why.
*  Satan is the outcast.
*  Right.
*  So it's like anytime they would tell you.
*  So that is that part of their thing.
*  I don't know.
*  All I'm saying is when you judge a tree by its fruit.
*  And here's the thing man.
*  Like I think not those guys ever thought you'd be on here simping for Satan bro.
*  I'm not simping for Satan.
*  I'm just saying Satanism is Christianity.
*  Oh I see what you're saying.
*  You know what I mean.
*  It's like a sect of Christianity.
*  It's like yeah.
*  It's like that that form emerges from Christianity.
*  But what's that.
*  What about the evil stuff.
*  Like what is where the tenants of Satanism like what's the most evil stuff.
*  The evil stuff and so is him.
*  Yeah.
*  So the Christianity has evil stuff in it.
*  Right.
*  OK.
*  So there's we both agree to that.
*  There's different forms of Satanism.
*  There's the van Satanism.
*  There's the temple of Satan.
*  They have to pick.
*  Oh so it's like it's Baptist Protestants.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And so there's the romantic Satanism.
*  Right.
*  So like so like in romantic state not like romantic in the sense of like who is it.
*  Milton like the idea is like you have this this being that is like I don't really want
*  to be forced to worship you and I don't understand necessarily why you should have
*  all the power and what the fuck like what the fuck and then gets thrown into hell and
*  then and suddenly this bifurcation emerges between good and evil sacred and profane.
*  And so that version of Satanism is looking at that not as like what is the general
*  interpretation which is the problem with Satan was Satan was like incredibly self
*  cherishing self absorbed like really into himself whereas God is like God's like the
*  sun just like radiating life and love and like with no sense of like give anything back
*  to me just like love whereas Satan is more about like me.
*  So and Satan is like the worst human instincts or or Satan is more about maybe you could
*  say the idea is like I am I am God.
*  Right.
*  So like like me I'm God.
*  So it's like my impulses and instincts and desires aren't bad.
*  Why are you telling me it's bad to jerk off.
*  Why are you telling me that it's bad to come.
*  Why are you telling me these things are bad when like all of them make me feel happy
*  and good and why are you turning me into a fucking monster for this shit.
*  And who the fuck do you think you are.
*  I'm trying in the best way possible to depict a more sort of anti authoritarian
*  mysticism.
*  Right.
*  So the symbol set they use is Satan which any most sickness I've talked to like there's
*  no fucking Satan which I know everyone's like of course they say that.
*  Of course that's the horror movie.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  But I would just invite you to if you are like freaked out by Satanist go hang out with
*  one and you are going to have great fucking problems with the first picture I took with
*  that Satanist.
*  But I do have to say that at your wedding party that you performed at that day they
*  were all nice.
*  Everybody was real nice.
*  Right.
*  They were all friendly.
*  We had a good time.
*  We were barbeque.
*  We were barbeque barbeque barbeque.
*  We were everything was very weird just already.
*  Life was where breathing air was weird.
*  Right.
*  The sensation of your socks touching your toes as your socks are compressed by the
*  heel of your shoe.
*  All that was weird.
*  It was a crazy fucking night.
*  Barbeque.
*  And then there's the Satanist that are getting married like what are we doing here.
*  This is so crazy.
*  And to watch you perform in front of them I was like this is crazy.
*  And by the way it was like real Satanist like that's the other thing.
*  This is like that because it is a religion and it really was real.
*  It was like real Satanist and many of them were.
*  And you know I just like ever since I like hung out with them even though I don't hang
*  out with them anymore or I saw Zandora in San Francisco it was nice.
*  But like I like it's just any time when people are railing against the Satanist I
*  feel like maybe it's just some manics.
*  I feel like they're they're confused regarding like at least like what what that
*  thing is versus demon people into ending hurting people or subjugating people or
*  like like hurting people.
*  Right.
*  I never encountered evil murder.
*  Yes.
*  Do you think Satan is a real thing.
*  Do you think there is a Satan.
*  Is it is it a real being.
*  Is it an entity or does it represent like the worst aspects of human nature.
*  Does it represent the most violent and vile just instincts that we've adopted or
*  we've inherited rather from our simian ancestors that just had to fight tooth and
*  claw for survival.
*  And then we've developed this ability to be ruthless and cruel because that's the
*  only thing that keeps you alive.
*  And much that's one of the theories isn't it about why women are attracted to
*  serial killers.
*  It's like knowing someone can kill no one.
*  So there's an attraction to that because that person could protect you and keep you
*  alive in the most dangerous of times because some people just can't.
*  They can't do it.
*  They don't know what to do.
*  The panic if something happens they don't they'll fall apart.
*  I'm so glad you're mentioning this because my wife has started reading and she told
*  me I could talk about this on my podcast.
*  I'm assuming it's OK on yours.
*  She started she started like remember Harlequin romance.
*  Oh yeah.
*  OK so there is a new evolution of that shit which is the most fucking hardcore BDSM
*  porn. There's something called Book Talk where all the ladies are talking about this
*  shit. She started reading these books.
*  Now one of the books she like.
*  Dude Shades of Grey.
*  Don't you remember those days.
*  This makes 50 Shades of Grey look like Dr.
*  Seuss.
*  Dude really.
*  Can I give you like one of her books.
*  And by the way now she's like got a stack of these fucking things.
*  One of these books.
*  So in this book.
*  A lady is a thief and she steals the identity of a shark expert.
*  She fucks him steals his identity.
*  So the scene I read she's on this boat with a shark researcher and he's fucking her
*  and he's like just fucking the shit out of her and she loves it.
*  And then you know he does.
*  He like he's like I know you fucking stole my identity.
*  He kisses her bites her lip bites her fucking lip draws blood takes her to the side of
*  the boat with her bleeding mouth shoves her head into the water while he's fucking her.
*  So the blood starts drawing sharks to like bite her while he's fucking her.
*  And like like it's crazy dude.
*  It's like it's the craziest porn I've ever read man.
*  And like this is like a whole genre now.
*  Have you been really into this.
*  What.
*  Yes.
*  How popular is this.
*  Very popular.
*  They all like they're all.
*  Let's pull up some of these these titles.
*  I haven't stumbled across it.
*  Let me text Darren.
*  I'll get the name of the fucking shark book.
*  Hold on. Hold on.
*  Hold on.
*  Christ dude.
*  What is the genre of porn called again.
*  It's I don't it's called.
*  Well she says it's something about book.
*  What's let me just ask her what's the name of the shark book.
*  Did you one handed text or you one.
*  God she makes so much.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  I can't do both hands man.
*  You can't text with your thumbs.
*  You only have to text with your index finger.
*  I have to relearn it.
*  Really.
*  I'm old.
*  Right. But when did you start texting just with one finger.
*  God damn it man.
*  I've been doing it forever and Aaron totally makes fun of me for it
*  because it takes me forever and I just tap it out.
*  Why do you do that.
*  That seems weird.
*  Do you remember the time I was on your podcast years ago
*  and didn't know I could put my phone on silent.
*  And I'm pitching because it.
*  I got bummed out when Apple took away that switch.
*  You know you switch so you knew it was off.
*  You knew it was on vibrate.
*  I know dude.
*  Yeah.
*  Why did they take away that switch.
*  I don't know.
*  Now they were placed with a button but the button gets pressed accidentally sometimes.
*  Got it.
*  A lot of the times.
*  Does it hurt.
*  Does it hurt.
*  Jesus.
*  That's the name of the book.
*  Does it hurt.
*  How many copies.
*  Let's find out how many copies of Does It Hurt have been sold.
*  Do they give out that information.
*  They have to write New York Times bestseller list.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean this is in the genre of the I think we've talked about it like the Bigfoot porn
*  like there's a whole series of Bigfoot like where Bigfoot is just like like stealing like women who've been camping.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Bigfoot porn has come to Bigfoot.
*  Come for Bigfoot.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a whole group of those books and I guess some women get off on the fact of being just savaged by Bigfoot.
*  Yeah.
*  Or Bigfoot eating their fucking pussy.
*  Yeah.
*  And like.
*  Dude.
*  Imagine the tongue on that guy.
*  They love it.
*  Wonderful tongue.
*  Be like your whole head.
*  And they fall in love with him.
*  Like.
*  I don't blame him.
*  It's a bear.
*  Is there a bestseller list.
*  He's a fucking super dimensional creature.
*  You think he's you believe in that the dimensional Bigfoot.
*  I think there are states of consciousness that you can reach whether it's under duress fear anxiety combination those things.
*  There's psychiatric drugs psychedelic drugs.
*  But I think there's a there's a place that you could reach where you could see into other possibilities.
*  I think you can see things that aren't necessarily there in a physical sense.
*  Right.
*  You can see you're there with them.
*  They're there with you.
*  Right.
*  They don't exist but you can see them.
*  And it's not a hallucination.
*  It's like you're tapping into like the grayness in between universes in between dimensions.
*  You're tapping into this area of weirdness.
*  Yeah.
*  And this area of weirdness I think is ghosts.
*  I think this area of weirdness is goblins and things that people see sometimes.
*  I don't think they're real.
*  I don't think anybody's going to get eaten by a goblin.
*  But I do think that there's too many fucking stories of elves for me not to think that someone reached some state of mind where they saw like a little person in the woods talking to them.
*  Right.
*  And that little person might be real.
*  It just might not be a physical thing that you could put on a scale.
*  They call it the astral realm.
*  There might be something there.
*  Yeah.
*  There's too many stories that the problem of stories being similar as people hear the stories and their imagination takes over and they depict their things similar to the story that they've heard.
*  That's a problem with like a copycat bullshit or copycat bullshit artist problem.
*  But there's also too many stories of elves man.
*  Yeah.
*  There's too many of those stories and there's too many depictions of elves that are dancing around mushrooms like.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking duh.
*  Like duh.
*  Like maybe they're real.
*  Maybe you're being ignorant and so silly and so cocky especially people that have no psychedelic experience.
*  Right.
*  Those babies.
*  Yeah.
*  Those fucking babies when they talk to you about the damage it does and the dangers while they're fat and out of shape shut the fuck up.
*  Stop.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  Yeah.
*  Literally don't know what you're talking about.
*  You have no idea what's possible.
*  Right.
*  You're living in this fucking black and white TV world.
*  And you've been brainwashed.
*  I mean don't forget that.
*  Like they went through the war on drugs.
*  They got indoctrinated into this insane anti.
*  They have to do it if they're experts in the field.
*  Whatever field is represented you know like whatever science is that has to do with neurochemistry.
*  I got you.
*  You mean the fashionable attitude people who are like trying to protect their careers.
*  Have to.
*  Even though inside they know.
*  So all of the professors who we go to as experts are all compromised at least in some way.
*  A lot of them.
*  I shouldn't say all of them.
*  But a lot of them.
*  Just a virtue if you stick your neck out and say I like to use psilocybin.
*  Like people are like what.
*  Well I mean.
*  You're a crazy drug addict.
*  But dude like you know like Doblin.
*  He's having meetings in the fucking Pentagon.
*  I think the consciousness has changed.
*  The zeitgeist has changed.
*  And it has because of the internet.
*  Because you know you can hear Terrence McKenna lectures.
*  You can hear Alan Watts.
*  You can hear people talking about it.
*  You could you could watch documentaries on psychedelics.
*  You could see what MAPS has done.
*  You can see all the podcasts that Doblin's gone on.
*  I mean.
*  Right.
*  How many people are we talking about that have been exposed to these ideas that were never exposed to them when we were kids.
*  Yeah.
*  When we were kids when you and I were kids when we were in high school you didn't hear fucking shit.
*  There's this one dude who was a drug addict and he hung out over there and he's a loser.
*  And you didn't hear a peep about shamanic rituals and Gordon Wasson going down to Mexico and getting all the mushrooms and you know and doing these ceremonies with these traditional shaman down.
*  You didn't hear any of that.
*  You didn't hear any of that.
*  Nothing.
*  Nobody knew what the fuck was going on.
*  We were kids.
*  They silenced it.
*  They threw water on the biggest one of the biggest cultural revolutions that's documentable without the use of the Internet.
*  And that was the psychedelic revolution of the 1960s.
*  It changed music.
*  It changed movies.
*  It changed comedy.
*  It changed everything.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking everything.
*  Every single thing got changed and in a radical leap.
*  If you look at the 1950s you look at the 1960s like woo something happened.
*  Look at the cars got cooler.
*  The music sounded better.
*  That's a big cultural shift.
*  And you know we have to thank for that.
*  The CIA.
*  Yes.
*  The CIA.
*  The CIA is the reason that all these LSD studies happen.
*  And like you wrote one flow over the Cuckoo's Nest.
*  Ken Kesey.
*  Ken Kesey apparently was in one of these LSD experiments.
*  And he's just one of many great artists who accidentally got like liberated mentally by the fucking CIA.
*  You know what I mean.
*  They were just like we want to use this to interrogate people.
*  And all of a sudden you've got Jimi Hendrix and they're like wow you didn't expect that.
*  Oh my God.
*  And then there's also there's also all these theories about the CIA creating like the whole Laurel Canyon scene the rock and roll.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's very compelling.
*  It's very interesting.
*  It seems like they were involved.
*  I think they've always been involved in the music business just like they've always been involved in the movie business.
*  Like it makes sense.
*  The idea that the music business somehow escaped their grasp.
*  Like shut the fuck up.
*  Shut up.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  No it didn't.
*  That's crazy.
*  Because like who you promote that's the person that becomes famous.
*  And we've all seen that with like there's been you know a milli-vanillion shit like that.
*  Yeah.
*  It didn't make any sense.
*  Like why are they promoting this because like they had a product.
*  They're trying to push this product.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's a lot of money behind that and also a lot of influence cultural influence.
*  And when they went through all that Vietnam shit with the fucking the Beatles and you remember that.
*  Yeah.
*  They were like hey hey hey enough of this Lenin nonsense.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  All we are saying is give peace a chance.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  You're making it hard for us to sell heroin.
*  Yeah.
*  We're over there scooping up heroin.
*  Yeah.
*  In the South Pacific and you're fucking ruining everything.
*  Imagine all the people.
*  No.
*  No.
*  Like yeah I don't know man.
*  Like all I know is like you it's like there it's a very confusing thing.
*  If you want to be honest if you love psychedelics you owe a thank you to the fucking CIA.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Like like because I mean I don't know I don't know for sure.
*  Like I don't know for sure if the 60s as we understand them would have happened.
*  I don't think the CIA was like hey let's create a lot of flower children and make people like revalue life and realize that money maybe isn't actually like something you should die for.
*  And like go against war.
*  But I think like boom.
*  Wow.
*  That's what happened.
*  I mean and we got the Unabomber to go.
*  We got a lot of people.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of people that came out of that.
*  Here's a question.
*  What.
*  I want you to imagine a world where the sweeping psychedelics act of 1970 never gets installed.
*  It never happens.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you somehow or another.
*  Either they just don't think it's a priority.
*  Or it's a you know different administration.
*  They're not interested in locking down drugs.
*  Yeah.
*  Because one of the motivations for that in the 1970s was that they were going to target civil rights activists and anti-war activists.
*  That's what one of the methods methods to do it is to turn all these drugs that everybody was using into schedule one drugs.
*  All these drugs that made people question society all these drugs made people want to tune in turn on drop out all those drugs.
*  They were like we got to put a fucking kibosh on all these culture shifting drugs.
*  And the wild thing is they fucking did it.
*  That's the wild thing.
*  And that the brainwashing still works today.
*  The brainwashing that they did on these compounds that might be the root of all religious experiences.
*  All these things that you're hearing about in the Bhagavad Gita all these things you're hearing about in the Bible these wild ass crazy stories like what really happened.
*  Those people might have had a psychedelic experience.
*  And in fact the thing about that the University of Jerusalem that attributes the story of Moses and the burning bush to dimethyltryptamine.
*  Yeah.
*  Because they think it might be an acacia bush.
*  Right.
*  And they think they think one of these bushes that's really rich in DMT.
*  It makes sense.
*  Burning bush like you smoke it.
*  Duh.
*  Yeah.
*  It's right there in front of your face.
*  Right.
*  And if you take that and especially if you take that five thousand years ago.
*  Oh my God.
*  You're going to be convinced you're talking to God.
*  Yeah.
*  God talk to me.
*  It really did happen brothers and sisters.
*  And you tell this story.
*  This is what God told us.
*  This is what we need to do.
*  We need to love each other.
*  We need to follow laws.
*  He gave us a laws a series of laws.
*  Remember who was it Mel Brooks.
*  I brought you these 15 and he drops one of them.
*  Shit.
*  Ten ten commandments.
*  You remember that?
*  Fucking hilarious.
*  That's a classic.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean look for sure dude.
*  I mean like the and these like the consumption of these things has up until recently tended to be underground.
*  Like if you look at like what's it called?
*  Kaikyon.
*  If you look at the like it has been weirdly an underground thing.
*  And I think that's what we that if there is some cool thing that came from us coming up in the war on drugs.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like when I was taking LSD in high school.
*  And getting like an immediate reality check which is like you're hearing about this as being like since you were a kid.
*  You're going to go nuts.
*  You're going to like become legally insane whatever the fuck that means.
*  And then you take it and you're processing weird shit that happened in your childhood.
*  You're loving yourself.
*  You're looking at the world and seeing it like it's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen.
*  You're hearing music that you've heard a million times for the first time.
*  And you realize oh they're lying.
*  This is wonderful.
*  This isn't madness.
*  And if it is madness then this is the kind of crazy all of us need to go like.
*  And so what.
*  But you couldn't tell your parents.
*  You wanted to.
*  You want to be like mom I think this might help you.
*  But you couldn't because you go you'd be fucked.
*  So five year mandatory minimum five year fucking mandatory minimum.
*  They're locking people up.
*  Still people in jail right now for this fucking beautiful gift to humanity.
*  And so we got to experience it from the underground perspective which was mostly horrific.
*  It produces paranoia.
*  You're scared. You felt like a criminal for nothing.
*  So yeah man like the but but if you look at the history any substance like psilocybin LSD that breaks down the identity that allows freedom from the
*  sense of this is me and that's you and produces at least the potential for merging with reality and with other people.
*  It's not going to work for that fucking hierarchical system for the hierarchical system the function you need.
*  You're below me.
*  You're above me.
*  And the moment you're like we're we're all the same.
*  Then suddenly the caste system stop working classism stops working.
*  The whole fucking thing falls apart which is why I think that book you gave me the sacred mushroom on the cross or even give me when I was living with you.
*  You actually I was a dick.
*  I left down the fucking floor like one of the reading materials you gave me during that wonderful time was this insane book about Jesus and Christianity has its roots in psilocybin.
*  Yeah.
*  But like if you just for the sake of this rant if you look at Jesus as psychedelics it makes a lot of sense because what Jesus is saying is you don't need a priest class to communicate with the divine.
*  You can do it right now anytime you want any day you want.
*  It's always here for you.
*  That's exactly what the mushrooms tell you.
*  And what happens to Jesus.
*  They fucking kill him.
*  And so it's like the relationship between centralized power and psychedelics has always been a contentious one.
*  Right.
*  Because because psychedelics just tell you yeah you're OK.
*  That's one of the things they'll tell you.
*  Maybe you need to fucking like walk your dogs more or whatever.
*  But like ultimately you get this realization I'm OK.
*  So it's also the power structures that exist without psychedelics aren't possible if everyone's on psychedelics and then you have ancient Greece.
*  Right.
*  So like how did ancient Greece emerge and emerge because of the Kukion.
*  It emerged because the people these doing these hallucinian mysteries.
*  They were learning things about themselves and the world and they were they decided it was like it's great democracy.
*  I mean that's really what it comes from.
*  So that's what's scary.
*  That's what's scary to people that are in power and also the ignorance.
*  They we know that they haven't done it because if they've done it they wouldn't be advocating against it.
*  It doesn't make any sense unless they've only done it once and then they reverted or maybe a couple of times.
*  People do revert.
*  One of the things that makes people revert is they get older and they get bitter and they haven't done psychedelics in a long long time and then they become like a shitty Republican when they get older.
*  You know well you know man this is this is the this is what I there's this Buddhist teacher I love Sharon Salzberg.
*  And one of her sayings I love is the healing is in the return meaning yeah the way the waveform works is especially psychedelics.
*  You get the glimpse of the divine you forgive yourself thus forgiving everyone around you.
*  You but you you've experienced true compassion and then you come down and then you crust up.
*  You know what I mean.
*  You crust the fuck up and now you get crusty and now you're like starting to get irritable again and angry again and fucked up.
*  And like yeah and if you don't mitigate that in some way but by like what is it.
*  What is it Bill Hicks says squeegeeing your fucking third eye.
*  If you don't like do a nice squeegee here and there then yeah you do end up crusted over you do end up like looking back at those ideas you had and saying to yourself that was highly unrealistic.
*  What the fuck was I thinking.
*  But you know there's always that's the thing it's always.
*  I don't this is this is my problem with psychedelics.
*  My problem with psychedelics psychedelics can they don't obviously it's a chemical but what can happen is psychedelics used become the priest class.
*  So you take the psychedelic and you think I'm experiencing this because of the thing when the reality is the thing is showing you what's in you.
*  It's always there right.
*  And so the healing is in the return is the moment you realize like oh fuck it's still here.
*  It never went anywhere.
*  Right.
*  And so those crusty ass fucking Republicans whoever they may be like just under the fucking surface is that unit of consciousness if you ask me.
*  Yeah they're just cowards.
*  When if you're that way if you're authoritarian whether you're authoritarian left or authoritarian right.
*  Generally speaking unless you're talking about crime and like and even then you're scared right because really you should be addressing the root of the problem.
*  Yeah.
*  Why why do so many people from so many very distinct areas keep going into crime and why is there nothing being done stop that.
*  But those those people that are authoritarian like in terms of like religious beliefs in terms of behavior the way people dress gays in public that kind of stuff.
*  Those people are all scared that comes from a place of being scared.
*  Yeah.
*  Gay people in public is not a problem assholes in public is a problem and if the gay people are nice you have a great time.
*  If the gay people are assholes just like if the straight people are assholes you have a shitty time.
*  It's not a gay straight thing.
*  It's a human being being kind and normal and friendly to people.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's possible with everybody but people think that all those are the ones that are going to be mean to me and fuck them.
*  They're responsible.
*  No those are individual human beings and you're grouping them together because you're scared.
*  You can call it pattern recognition you can call it whatever you want you can call it racism.
*  We'll go whatever you want.
*  But all you're doing you're lumping people in together because you're scared.
*  That's it.
*  And you should be aware of danger but to be so scared that you want to control other people's behavior is like a bad sign.
*  That's a bad sign.
*  You know if you want to tell people what language they can use that's a bad sign.
*  Yes that sounds religious too.
*  You want to tell people how they have to dress or what kind of music they listen to.
*  Like this has all been bad always from the beginning of time whether it's coming from the left or the right.
*  Whether it's fucking the Al Gore shit that was in the tipper core shit in the 1980s that was coming from the left.
*  So left wing politicians are trying to censor rap music.
*  That's the reason why you have those those dummies.
*  They created that warning explicit lyrics.
*  That's all anybody wanted to buy.
*  Oh my god.
*  We didn't have the warning explicit lyrics.
*  Kids didn't want to buy those CDs.
*  Get the fuck out of here with your G rated rap.
*  Andrew Dice Clay.
*  Remember Dice Clay had that on his fucking album.
*  Oh score.
*  Dude what.
*  Score.
*  That boosted album sales.
*  I'll tell you this.
*  Through the roof.
*  But that was but the point is the same thing right.
*  It's the same on the left as it is on the right.
*  It's just authoritarians.
*  They're all scared.
*  You got it.
*  This is exact.
*  This is so to answer your question do I believe in Satan.
*  I believe in fear and fear and the devil are the fucking same thing.
*  And it's like this is if you want to talk about what Satan is it's the it's the cloud of fear that lives inside the individual and then
*  collectivizes in a fearful reaction and how to frighten people react to things.
*  Anger.
*  Violence.
*  Judgment.
*  And so like so what's the opposite of fear man.
*  Love.
*  Love is the opposite of fear.
*  And so this is to me like this is the issue.
*  It's not left right.
*  It's it's that if you are making decisions based on fear.
*  More than likely the result is going to create something that makes you more afraid.
*  And you know that's just how it works.
*  It just fear leads to fucking fear.
*  It's in the ingredients.
*  It's in the fucking ingredients dude.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So you just turn on the fucking light.
*  I mean Buddhism this is when they talk about enlightenment.
*  They talk about like in it.
*  If you're if you if we're in a pitch black room it could be scary.
*  I don't know what's around me.
*  There's weird sounds.
*  What what the fuck.
*  You ever woken up in the middle of night kind of bleary and something that's been in your room forever.
*  You can't see it clearly because you're waking up and it's a person.
*  Oh it's my chair.
*  Right.
*  So so the example this is and this is why Satan in mythology is the deceiver because it's not there.
*  It's literally not fucking there.
*  The moment you turn on the light everything's fine.
*  Except in this case the light is love.
*  The moment that you have the fucking guts to love the person that you are like to really like cultivate love.
*  Fuck dude.
*  No one's scary anymore.
*  You're you with my kids.
*  You know you're anyone who has kids knows what I'm fucking talking about.
*  They can do things that are insane like to your house to the walls.
*  To say things to you that if any adult said it to you you might never forgive them.
*  You're going to think about it for a long fucking time like your beard stinks or whatever.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Like you meet somebody like dude your fucking beard stinks.
*  Honestly I probably like you like you.
*  But you know what I mean.
*  Because we love our kids instantly forgive you know.
*  Well it's not just that they're also they don't know any better.
*  They haven't learned social skills.
*  And this is why one of my favorite things Jesus said when he's being crucified.
*  Father forgive them.
*  They don't know what they're doing.
*  And that's what he fucking meant.
*  How much of that do you think is historically accurate.
*  Like how much of the Jesus story do you think is historically accurate.
*  When you hear about it.
*  No idea.
*  Don't care.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't care.
*  I thought I just love the story.
*  I don't.
*  I love the story and I love I love a story about what happened because you always have to filter to the very real
*  understanding that we all have about the way human beings tell stories.
*  It's hard to know what's bullshit because people just lie about stuff and that's not a new thing.
*  Yeah.
*  So but people also tell the truth about stuff.
*  That's not a new thing either.
*  People also write down very important things and there are people that are virtuous and there are people that are honest and there are people that are authentic.
*  They've always existed right.
*  And they've always.
*  There's people that are smart enough to understand the value of just being truthful.
*  Right.
*  So those people that encountered something exceptional and crazy something insane whether it is you know the resurrection or whatever it was.
*  Like yeah I would like I would love to know what the fuck they really said.
*  What were the actual words.
*  Why did you write it down.
*  What did what really happened.
*  How many people were told this story back and forth over hundreds of years before you wrote it down.
*  Yeah.
*  What was the original story right.
*  Like right.
*  We don't.
*  It's so hard.
*  It's like trying to get a story about the things that George Washington said that weren't written down.
*  Yeah.
*  They weren't written down.
*  You know like right.
*  Three hundred years ago.
*  What.
*  How.
*  Well you like.
*  So in the same way fear produces other forms of writing like Mein Kampf.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Right.
*  So like it's cymatics you know you take a vibration you throw some fucking flour on a vibrating plate.
*  According to the like whatever the frequency is it forms a certain it creates a pattern right.
*  So like fear fear always creates a pretty similar pattern right.
*  Right.
*  And love also creates a very similar pattern.
*  So it's so like this is the book of John my favorite book in the Gospels.
*  It starts off with in the beginning was the word but and the word became a person.
*  And so but that's not really what it's saying.
*  It's like it's a logo.
*  So in the in the beginning was some fundamental reality just truth just basic beautiful fucking perfect truth.
*  And that's what the universe sprang from.
*  And then that truth became a person.
*  So the truth could now talk like it now began to convey itself to other people.
*  And so that that truth I think if you understood it enough you could probably create a set of symbols that would function on many levels that were
*  all good.
*  One level just basic ethics do on others what you would have them do under you blessed are the peacemakers all of this stuff right.
*  But then knowing human psyche and the human mind you could also hide deeper levels of that truth into parables into like stories that are
*  mathematically perfect to the point where the crucifixion if you look at it from the perspective of two intersecting timelines which is the
*  infinite and the finite meeting which is what humans are then you realize we're all being crucified on time and there and then the crucifixion
*  becomes like a existential reality.
*  This is what you want to know why you're feeling fucked up.
*  It's because part of you is forever and part of you is going to die and you are fucking hanging on a cross between two thieves the past and the
*  fucking future.
*  And any time you're thinking about that it's stealing the moment.
*  And so like you then there's that level right.
*  And so any of these great texts like the New Testament they're coded so that depending on where you want to go with it you can go as deep as you want.
*  It's an infinite rabbit hole.
*  And I think that rabbit hole emerged from vibration.
*  I sound like what's his face the guy I loved him on the Terrence.
*  Like idiot Terrence Howard.
*  But like like I sound dumb Terrence.
*  I know he was talking about vibrations and stuff.
*  He's great. But like my point is if there is some fundamental vibration to love then that might grow into time in a story and the story because it's coming from perfect
*  truth would have infinite levels to it that it was alive.
*  The story itself would be alive which is why they call the Bible like the living word.
*  It's alive.
*  It's talking to you.
*  It's not a one way communication.
*  It's like that's what's scary about it.
*  Dude read the fucking Bible on mushrooms.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Like that's probably how it was written.
*  I wish I could read like the ancient versions in the language and understand the language context.
*  Me too.
*  Because it's not just about learning the language.
*  It would be about understanding the context of the language.
*  Like imagine if you could really understand ancient Hebrew where the letters double as numbers.
*  Dude.
*  That must be so weird.
*  Yeah man.
*  And like that's real.
*  That's the other thing about it is like the historic Jesus and all that.
*  God that shit like like like OK.
*  I don't know but look at the thing itself.
*  Right. Look at what.
*  Look what it said.
*  Look what whatever this idea spawned.
*  Look what it look what it means.
*  Like look at all the powerful principles that are that emerge from it.
*  And then I'll look at like the moral scaffolding that it provides for people.
*  Yeah.
*  And then and then and then like the like I think the reason like people get creeped out by it is because where there's one thing it's opposite must appear.
*  Right.
*  So here's this thing invite that is dissolving power structures and dissolving the priest class and dissolving like all of it.
*  And then you look at like the modern day versions of it and you see the same fucking hierarchy.
*  You see this thing that it seems to be antithetical to which is like saying like this is between you and me.
*  Right.
*  Suddenly there's people telling you you're wrong interpreting it for you and you look at that and you're like fuck that shit whatever that is.
*  I'm not in this charismatic people in front of large groups of people that really know how to manipulate people with the way they talk.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean this is the thing that was so problematic when they first started translating the Bible into phonetic languages and to languages like German.
*  When people started like during the Martin Luther days they're like hey what the fuck are you doing.
*  It used to be the priests had to read the Bible because they could read it in Latin.
*  You don't know Latin so shut the fuck up.
*  Yeah.
*  This is what God wants you to do.
*  Do it.
*  Yeah.
*  And then Martin Luther's coming along said you should interpret this your own way.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's just like what.
*  So they take away the gatekeepers to God.
*  That's it.
*  But when you have it's so crazy that it's such an efficient business they still run these fucking franchises even though the book is available everywhere.
*  It's so crazy that like this one person interprets this better than everybody else.
*  So you go see him and he talks and they develop egos and they have jets and they have fucking mansions and Rolls Royce.
*  It's so crazy that that works.
*  It crazy that that works when that book is available for everybody and should be interpreted.
*  I mean you should understand what it means.
*  You shouldn't interpret it ignorantly.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  But you if you were if you're wise enough to be able to in capture what they're trying to say just capture in your mind what they're trying to say and translate it into a thing that makes sense like what were they talking about.
*  Yeah.
*  What happened.
*  Is this is this a map of how the universe was created in the beginning there was light.
*  Is that a map or is that life itself.
*  Like what is that.
*  What is it.
*  What is that.
*  And to me that's like oh like the Bhagavad Gita any of these beautiful texts.
*  That's what's fun about them is that they it's producing a kind of like bizarre riddle in your own mind as you're trying to decode it.
*  But then there's a pull.
*  The more you study it the more you get drawn in and the more and when you start getting really drawn in that's when people start appearing around you.
*  That help in a non nefarious way that like you just start meeting people who help you understand it a little bit more and that's where it gets fucking weird.
*  Yes dude.
*  The simulations fuck your own.
*  By the way now that we've talked about the Bible can I talk about my new favorite book.
*  Yes.
*  Dianetics.
*  If you are to this book.
*  Yes.
*  I heard if you're really good at it they put you on a boat an org.
*  It's an org.
*  You get to be a part of an org a sea org.
*  You get a jacket with like some medals.
*  Dude it's my I've said on this podcast a million times my favorite Mark Twain quote.
*  Religion is what happened when the first con man met the first fool.
*  And dude like that's the problem with all this stuff is like this is.
*  The problem is there's too many versions right.
*  So someone's wrong.
*  No the problem is people don't trust their fucking instincts and it's like drive all blames into oneself.
*  It's like I'm like this is your nothing that I am seen in the New Testament seems to be inviting you to throw your rational mind away.
*  It's the whole fucking thing is crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  But it's like the invitation is to like you.
*  God gave you a rational fucking mind if there is a God and like anyone telling you to discard that and forego your interpretation for theirs.
*  Dude watch the fuck out.
*  This is your job.
*  Like just like whatever the fucking thing is whether it's the Bible Reddit conspiracy fucking for Chan whatever the fucking thing is.
*  What are you afraid of.
*  Like how do you not trust your mind.
*  How weak are you.
*  Are you really afraid to like take data in.
*  Do you think you're like you're going to be corrupted by data.
*  Well isn't it also an identity thing because if you identify as the first thing gets to talk in front of everybody you're the priest.
*  Right.
*  That's your identity and you're not going to give that up because then you're just another person who reads the Bible.
*  Yeah.
*  Well then Mike can go up to tomorrow Mike's going to go up Mike's been trying at home in front of the mirror and he thinks he's ready to priest.
*  Yeah priest.
*  So why don't you let Mike try it tomorrow night.
*  Debbie's been reading a lot too and Debbie like try Tuesday.
*  This guy's used to getting his jollies off three four times a week.
*  Yeah.
*  Telling people about blasphemy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And then especially if you like one of them tent revival guys those wild dudes like Kenison used to be.
*  Yeah.
*  Just carnage carnawrists that are also saying biblical quotes but they're manipulating people.
*  They're they're they're really good at talking.
*  They're hypnotizing people with their words just like you hypnotize a comedy audience.
*  Dude this is why I listen to Christian radio man because like I don't know.
*  No it's a comic listening to sermons and recognizing that that's a joke like that's a he's done that a lot.
*  Like that's one of his gags.
*  I know it's a bit I know what that is.
*  That's a fucking yeah.
*  But you know again it's like the comments section.
*  This is not an example of humanity.
*  It's an example of fucking people with toxoplasmosis who are you know what I mean motherfucker.
*  You know this is also just an example of you to you're not going to have everyone be the same.
*  You're going to have people that they'd never learn things well like look look if you if I got hired to be a part of some mathematical study.
*  Yeah I'm not I'm useless.
*  Okay.
*  I'm not that guy right.
*  That's I fucked up that part of my life.
*  I never really learned that.
*  Pay attention.
*  I'm not interested.
*  So that's not me but someone out there is right.
*  Right.
*  And you have those two things exist simultaneously.
*  You're going to have to have an infinite variety of possibilities for human beings.
*  So that's part of the problem.
*  Yeah.
*  Part of the problem is some people are just out of their fucking mind.
*  And if those people out of their fucking minds get special rights like the tax free exempt status because they're a pastor.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're a fucking psychopath is just really good at conning people.
*  And they're running this organization.
*  There might be a guy right down the street that's a real Christian.
*  There might be a guy right down the street that's a really kind person.
*  Yeah.
*  Really reading the word of Christ and he does it not for profit.
*  He does it to try to like establish the love of God in his community.
*  And he takes these people and like their family and his beautiful community aspect to it where everybody's like kind to each other.
*  It's beautiful things to church.
*  Right.
*  That's true too.
*  But the problem is humans just like the problem with our ability to other each other just a problem with the ability to attack people on the other side of the political spectrum.
*  We live in the same fucking city as you.
*  Yeah.
*  Like people are fucking rabid against other people in their town that want to vote for this guy that wants to do this and this guy wants to do that.
*  And fuck you.
*  You call me.
*  Yeah.
*  Everyone's going crazy.
*  Dude I know.
*  It's just a human thing.
*  It's a tribal thing.
*  We are not yet cooked.
*  We're we're fucking soft boiled egg baby.
*  And we're running.
*  Where's some eggs you get at the diner.
*  You go.
*  You see that fucking gelat.
*  That's us.
*  That's us.
*  We're not all the way cooked.
*  Yeah.
*  And when you eat things that aren't all the way cooked you got a lot of fucking problems.
*  You're gonna get sick.
*  Yeah.
*  But we're getting cooked buddy.
*  We're getting microwaved.
*  We're gonna get AI microwaved in about three years.
*  That's right baby.
*  The fucking AI Messiah is coming baby.
*  We are going to do a podcast.
*  You and I before this thing is done before civilization slides into the ocean again.
*  Where you and I are going to do a podcast where we communicate with everyone with no
*  words.
*  What's going to happen.
*  You're going to do it.
*  I'm going to do it.
*  We're going to be talking to each other with no words and we're talking to everyone else
*  out there with no words too.
*  We're all going to be synced up.
*  It's going to be a sea of ideas exposing each other to other ideas and like considering
*  other ideas with no attachment at all to your ego.
*  It's going to be super weird.
*  And then you know what's going to happen.
*  Aliens land.
*  No we're going to look around and be like wait this doesn't look like the Rogan studio.
*  This is just like some weird fucking room and then a CIA agent is going to come in and
*  be like thank you so much for participating in the experiment.
*  And Trump will be on his fourth term.
*  No it'll be the 60s and we'll realize we're in a fucking MK Ultra experiment.
*  That's probably true.
*  We've been rambling at each other for like what feels like a long time like our whole
*  lifetimes.
*  But it was like five seconds like well OK thank you for trying out 7 9 BLXY.
*  We really appreciate it.
*  Basement in Harvard right now.
*  Yeah.
*  Here's 20 bucks.
*  Yeah.
*  And Jolly West is looking at us with a clipboard.
*  Duncan I love you to death.
*  I love you Joe.
*  You are the best.
*  Always fun to get together.
*  Thank you for having me on man.
*  I love you to tears.
*  I love you too.
*  Goodbye everybody.
*  Bye.
