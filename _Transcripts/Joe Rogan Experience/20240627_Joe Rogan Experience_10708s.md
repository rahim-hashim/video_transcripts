# Joe Rogan Experience #2009 - Duncan Trussell
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=6.0s)]
*  Let's go. What's happening? Hello, doctor. Hello, doctor. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=14.0s)]
*  Hello. I feel good to be in a lab coat. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=18.0s)]
*  It feels like my opinion means more. Dude, it does. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=22.0s)]
*  I mean, this is freaking incredible. You don't realize the power in costumes until you got a lab coat on. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=26.0s)]
*  If we were walking around a CVS, people would ask us for advice. They would probably be like, is this the right spray for me? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=33.0s)]
*  It's amazing. It's amazing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=40.0s)]
*  What is the purpose of a lab coat? Why this particular coat? Does this provide any protection? Is it good for the act? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=42.0s)]
*  You want monkey blood on your good shirt? You got to wear the lab coat because you get blood. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=52.0s)]
*  Right. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when many scientific breakthroughs happened, the white lab coat started to symbolize cleanliness and scientific rigor. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=57.0s)]
*  Not only it made doctors and scientists easily distinguishable, but it also made spotting any contamination easier. That makes sense. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=69.0s)]
*  Was that a problem back then, mixing up your doctor with your scientist? Is that a real problem? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=76.0s)]
*  Was that what they were saying? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=81.0s)]
*  It says it makes doctors and scientists more easily distinguishable. Oh, together. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=83.0s)]
*  Yeah. They're both wearing lab coats. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=87.0s)]
*  It's not like costumes like doctor costumes. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=89.0s)]
*  Right. You go to a doctor, doctor, help me. I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm a PhD. I study nuclear atoms. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=91.0s)]
*  I like that that acknowledges that this is a kind of ceremonial outfit. It's a priest's robe because it's symbolic more than practical for some people. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=99.0s)]
*  Well, there's a bunch of those, right? Like the judge's robe. Oh my God. How weird is that? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=112.0s)]
*  Because if you had a guy who's dressed like in a golf shirt with shorts on and a pair of Nikes and he's like ruined judgment on things, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=117.0s)]
*  you'd be like, fuck that guy. Who's that guy? Yeah, he's a regular guy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=127.0s)]
*  Like a tank top. A dude in a tank top. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=131.0s)]
*  With a mullet. A dude who's dressed like Joe Dirt. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=137.0s)]
*  Also the hammer. They bang the hammer to signify that justice has been served. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=141.0s)]
*  What a weird trick. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=147.0s)]
*  That is a weird, I mean this is when you realize how all of society has got occult aspects to it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=149.0s)]
*  Like those are people in ceremonial clothes banging a ceremonial hammer. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=158.0s)]
*  If not occult, definitely cult. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=164.0s)]
*  Well, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=167.0s)]
*  What's the root of cult and occult? Like what is the connection to those two words? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=170.0s)]
*  The devil. Satan. Satan. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=178.0s)]
*  There's got to be some kind of connection, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=183.0s)]
*  The fascinating thing about cults is that when they get to a certain size, we stop calling them cults. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=187.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=193.0s)]
*  Like they're really successful. The idea is that there's no such thing as a successful cult and that's really just not true. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=194.0s)]
*  Okay, the words cult and occult are popular terms that should not be confused with one another. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=201.0s)]
*  So what are the differences between them? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=206.0s)]
*  The term cult typically is used by the secular media to describe religious or semi-religious groups whose members are controlled in almost every single respect by a single individual. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=208.0s)]
*  Some good examples are Hare Christians and Scientologists. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=221.0s)]
*  But that's not like a single individual. I don't think that's a good definition. You know what I'm saying? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=225.0s)]
*  By a single individual? That's not a group. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=230.0s)]
*  That's the classic. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=235.0s)]
*  Right, but they're saying Scientology. Scientology clearly has an organization. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=237.0s)]
*  I mean, there's one guy that's the head of Scientology, but they have like a whole... it's a very complex organization. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=242.0s)]
*  Very complex. Well, I mean, I think the idea is that the main cult leader generally has like deputies around him. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=249.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=257.0s)]
*  You know, he has his own sort of close inner circle. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=258.0s)]
*  Right. In that case it's true, right? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=261.0s)]
*  And then the culture gets in the deputies have deputies or whatever you want to call it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=263.0s)]
*  And then and that's how you get a big functional cult. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=266.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=270.0s)]
*  You know, and I think probably, I mean, it would be safe to say that a successful cult passes that barrier between what the fuck? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=271.0s)]
*  You guys believe that shit? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=283.0s)]
*  What the fuck? You don't believe that shit? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=285.0s)]
*  Like your cult doctrine becomes the language of truth. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=293.0s)]
*  And then you've succeeded. Like then your cult, that's like the one in a hundred million maybe. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=294.0s)]
*  Most cults just fail, I imagine. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=299.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that seems to be just a natural pattern for human thinking and behaving that we, for whatever reason, like naturally fall into groupthink. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=301.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=313.0s)]
*  And if we're led by a very strong, charismatic person that we think is exceptional, we'll accept it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=314.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=322.0s)]
*  Like you and I, you know, we've talked about this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=323.0s)]
*  I see the function in that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=326.0s)]
*  Like if you like if you're in a situation that you don't know how to handle, you want the person who's the best at handling the situation to say, here's what we do. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=328.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=337.0s)]
*  And then that's great. Then that's when it works. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=338.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=339.0s)]
*  But it should only be it should be situational, right? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=340.0s)]
*  It shouldn't be like, you know, everything. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=342.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=344.0s)]
*  That's where it turns into a cult. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=345.0s)]
*  Well, that's like that that what is that term that some people that are really smart tend to believe they're really smart at other things because they're really smart at one thing. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=346.0s)]
*  They'll get a distortion. It's a very common term. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=357.0s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=360.0s)]
*  It's at the tip of my tongue. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=361.0s)]
*  It's a distortion. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=363.0s)]
*  But it's a thing that happens to you when you're really good at one thing where you think you're just exceptional period. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=364.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=369.0s)]
*  I think you know more about me. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=370.0s)]
*  Maybe, you know, like there's scientists that are really terrible about health. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=372.0s)]
*  They're probably brilliant when it comes to certain aspects of whatever it is they study string theory. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=376.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=381.0s)]
*  But their their their knowledge of health, their knowledge of how to work their own. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=382.0s)]
*  I've talked to scientists. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=386.0s)]
*  I don't think vitamins are important. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=387.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you saying? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=389.0s)]
*  Dining Kruger. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=392.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=393.0s)]
*  The smart. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=394.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=395.0s)]
*  It says the smart you feel the dumber you are. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=396.0s)]
*  The dumb people think they are smart and the smart people think they're dumb. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=398.0s)]
*  If you're like most people, you're likely to be very good at something and you openly admit you're less competent at something else. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=402.0s)]
*  However, we've all met someone in our work and life who always overestimates their knowledge or ability of a certain topic or skill. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=409.0s)]
*  Where some people are obviously incompetent in a particular subject, you like confidently insist they know everything. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=418.0s)]
*  That's when you start to wonder how on earth could this person be that well stupid? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=425.0s)]
*  In fact, this is not uncommon. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=430.0s)]
*  Even William Shakespeare mentioned it 400 plus years ago. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=432.0s)]
*  The fool thinks himself to be wise while a wise man knows himself to be a fool. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=435.0s)]
*  Today, this phenomenon is known as cognitive bias of illusionary superiority. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=440.0s)]
*  So but it does have something to do with you being good at something and being really stupid at other things because you think you're smart. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=444.0s)]
*  What a great insult to tell someone that they have done in Cougar. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=454.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is a great way to call someone dumb. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=459.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's interesting because that's what this is the problem with the term dumb. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=462.0s)]
*  Really what it is is what are you focusing on? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=467.0s)]
*  Because there's very intelligent people that didn't focus on communication. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=471.0s)]
*  They didn't focus on language. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=477.0s)]
*  They didn't focus on proper grammar or how to structure good sentence. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=479.0s)]
*  They focused on a particular act, whether it's swimming or whether it's chess or whether they focus on whether it's playing guitar, playing pool. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=484.0s)]
*  I've met brilliant people playing pool. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=495.0s)]
*  I've told you about my friend, Johnny, who could do complex math in his head. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=498.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, not complex, but math in his head. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=503.0s)]
*  So what you would do, you would you would one guy would have a calculator and we would do this at the pool and then we would go three hundred divided by five minus four plus 16 times two. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=507.0s)]
*  And he would bang. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=519.0s)]
*  He was rattled out. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=521.0s)]
*  We would go, what the fuck, man? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=522.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=524.0s)]
*  What it what the fuck? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=525.0s)]
*  And he was homeless. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=526.0s)]
*  Did he say how he did the trick? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=527.0s)]
*  No, he just knew how to do it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=529.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=530.0s)]
*  He could just count. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=531.0s)]
*  Dude, he was just insanely smart. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=532.0s)]
*  But that implies like that's there was a kid in my neighborhood who could do that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=535.0s)]
*  And it was like he was annoyed because once you are known as being able to do that, that's all people do. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=540.0s)]
*  They don't want to talk to you. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=548.0s)]
*  They just want to get you to solve complex math and then go like, holy fuck. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=549.0s)]
*  But like, it makes me think that like they're perceiving reality in a completely different way. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=553.0s)]
*  They must be. They must be. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=560.0s)]
*  They have to be. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=561.0s)]
*  They must be. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=562.0s)]
*  And this guy, Johnny, he had a lot of mental health problems, like serious mental health problems and drug problems. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=563.0s)]
*  But he was one of the most brilliant people I've ever met and socially brilliant. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=571.0s)]
*  He's a pool hustler. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=576.0s)]
*  Yeah. But he's very socially brilliant. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=577.0s)]
*  Like he knew when people were full of shit. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=579.0s)]
*  He knew when when people's egos were flaring up. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=581.0s)]
*  He knew like and he loved comedy. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=584.0s)]
*  It was like his favorite thing. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=587.0s)]
*  And so I met him at the pool hall and I took him to see comedy and I took him to one of my shows and he fucking loved it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=589.0s)]
*  He's like, oh, I love when they call people out on their bullshit. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=596.0s)]
*  Like it was like he was like a social scientist. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=600.0s)]
*  Yeah. But also could play all these different musical instruments. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=602.0s)]
*  Homeless, homeless. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=606.0s)]
*  I met a kid who was 16 years old and he was a chess wizard who like wanted to hang out with the bad boys. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=608.0s)]
*  And it was really interesting because he was like this super nerd that all of a sudden he was hanging out with these guys who were smoking and gambling and he was 16. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=615.0s)]
*  And it's like really rough pool hall. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=622.0s)]
*  And he would sit down with this guy who just got out of jail. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=624.0s)]
*  And this guy just got out of jail and in jail learned how to play chess in his head so they don't have a board. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=627.0s)]
*  So because they don't have a board, they have to call out the numbers in their head. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=634.0s)]
*  So I'm watching this recently released prisoner and a 16 year old super nerd play chess in their head and they're calling it out. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=637.0s)]
*  And I'm sitting there like I'm watching them do magic. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=646.0s)]
*  What? Yeah. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=648.0s)]
*  So like C to four seven. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=650.0s)]
*  Yep. Yep. Yep. And they're keeping track of the whole table in their head. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=652.0s)]
*  They just see it in their head. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=655.0s)]
*  And there was no arguments by the way. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=656.0s)]
*  It's just you know you hear about you know I think we talked about the mothership the other night but you hear about people who perceive numbers as colors or something or is it's like their brain has made a different connection because because if you think about what our eyes do with photons. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=658.0s)]
*  That's insane that instantaneously it forms time space around you with like zero effort like it's interpreting all this data color wavelengths all that shit. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=678.0s)]
*  It's crazy. Yeah. Grapheme color, Synthesia. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=691.0s)]
*  So I want to show you people playing chess in their head because it's crazy. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=695.0s)]
*  But what I was saying there was no arguments like they never said no no no I had this that there. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=700.0s)]
*  There was none of that. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=705.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=706.0s)]
*  They knew exactly they both knew exactly where everything was and they were like check. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=707.0s)]
*  Check. They're seeing the table in their head clearly. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=712.0s)]
*  It's like they're going to visual. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=715.0s)]
*  It's like they're just seeing it and so. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=717.0s)]
*  And they're keeping track of all their pieces and all their opponents pieces. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=719.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=724.0s)]
*  Yeah man. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=725.0s)]
*  I mean. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=727.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=728.0s)]
*  Watch them do it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=729.0s)]
*  It's really interesting to see. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=730.0s)]
*  Do you add that? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=732.0s)]
*  It's called blindfolded chess. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=733.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=735.0s)]
*  It's a skill. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=736.0s)]
*  I'm watching. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=737.0s)]
*  I'm looking at. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=738.0s)]
*  Oh it's got to be a skill. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=739.0s)]
*  There's videos of people teaching you how to do it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=740.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=741.0s)]
*  But I'm trying to. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=742.0s)]
*  This is just like people talking about it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=743.0s)]
*  I'm just trying to find a. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=744.0s)]
*  Like a game I guess. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=746.0s)]
*  It's not showing two people though. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=748.0s)]
*  It's not. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=749.0s)]
*  It's kind of hard to watch. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=750.0s)]
*  Is there one that says how to two people playing blindfolded chess. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=751.0s)]
*  I figured something would pop up by playing chess. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=756.0s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=758.0s)]
*  No. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=759.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=760.0s)]
*  In chess is head to head to head mental combat. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=761.0s)]
*  That's just a different kind of chess. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=764.0s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=765.0s)]
*  What is it called again? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=766.0s)]
*  This is something else. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=767.0s)]
*  What do they call it? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=768.0s)]
*  Blindfolded chess. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=769.0s)]
*  How about just typing two people playing blindfolded chess. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=770.0s)]
*  Chess. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=774.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=775.0s)]
*  Blindfolded chess. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=778.0s)]
*  It's just one guy. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=780.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=782.0s)]
*  There's a guy playing 48 games blindfolded. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=783.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=786.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=787.0s)]
*  What? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=788.0s)]
*  While he's riding an exercise bike. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=789.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=790.0s)]
*  That's so insane. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=791.0s)]
*  While the games start at the same time. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=793.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=796.0s)]
*  That is so insane. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=797.0s)]
*  What? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=798.0s)]
*  Is there a video? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=799.0s)]
*  80% win rate. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=802.0s)]
*  Can you imagine getting beaten? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=804.0s)]
*  I feel so bad. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=806.0s)]
*  He says he developed a technique called memory palace. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=809.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=813.0s)]
*  That is used by memory competitors usually to remember things like numbers or the order [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=816.0s)]
*  Numbers or the order of playing cards. He said each game is like a room in a palace. Yeah, it's all there [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=820.0s)]
*  He explained the chest calm I walk into my kitchen to see that stack of bananas [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=826.68s)]
*  The abstract images are an analog for specific moves. So presumably he now knows a lot of different fruits [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=830.7s)]
*  Wow [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=839.58s)]
*  That is so insane that memory palace shit is really interesting because you're like you're connecting your memory to the visual [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=840.78s)]
*  Yeah [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=849.12s)]
*  I wonder I wonder if that I mean this is essentially a short-term memory thing you're relying upon [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=852.12s)]
*  I wonder if [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=859.52s)]
*  that I [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=861.6s)]
*  Wonder if that does anything for your long-term memory, too [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=863.04s)]
*  I wonder if they do say that chess is like one of the very best games [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=866.24s)]
*  For just just your cognitive function makes sense. Yeah super complex [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=871.12s)]
*  I mean think of it's basically like running with your brain. Yeah, right. Did you ever get into it? No [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=876.92s)]
*  It's scared. It's it's pretty I [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=884.12s)]
*  Only got into it cuz I had a cool video game where the chess pieces could fight [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=886.9599999999999s)]
*  And so that made me like get interested in like the most surface level [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=891.16s)]
*  I mean I was horrible, but you know the opening moves and how each opening move [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=895.9s)]
*  There's statistically I think the right opening second move to do against the opening move and then you all these [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=902.34s)]
*  Combos and shit that you have to memorize [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=908.3000000000001s)]
*  It's so and then you have to think so many moves ahead [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=910.86s)]
*  So the based on all the possible things they might do [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=915.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah producing all these parallel chess timelines and you're trying to pick the one that's like the one you win in [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=918.82s)]
*  Chess falls into that whole golf thing with me. I'm sure I'd love it. Yeah, but I don't want to do that [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=925.26s)]
*  I don't have any time for anything new like that. I already have a problem with pool [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=931.62s)]
*  You know I [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=936.5s)]
*  Fucking want to play it all the time. Yeah. Well, I mean it's a lot easier to for me to like [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=938.4200000000001s)]
*  Level up in Diablo [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=945.46s)]
*  Then go to the gym, right? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=948.5s)]
*  infinitely easier [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=951.38s)]
*  And my brain does not produce the same level of pleasure leaving the gym. But what is it like? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=953.0600000000001s)]
*  30% of that and I think [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=959.3s)]
*  Sometimes if you are particularly weak, you'll just settle for that. You're like, you know what? That's fine [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=962.5s)]
*  I'll enjoy that and then it just goes on and on, you know [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=969.1800000000001s)]
*  You need to have undisciplined people on your show sometimes because I'm always struggling with it [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=972.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? And you're like discipline you but I'm I am [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=978.42s)]
*  Like it's an aspiration and so I'll get going to the gym. I'll start working out [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=982.5s)]
*  I'll feel better than I've ever felt my life. You know what got me to the gym, by the way [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=988.18s)]
*  I started going the last podcast you described how you feel [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=991.7399999999999s)]
*  Not working out and I'm like, that's the last two years of my life [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=997.7399999999999s)]
*  And then you know, so I'm like fuck I got to do this and like, you know walking out [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1005.9799999999999s)]
*  It's simultaneously wonderful and kind of sad because you walk out and you're like, I feel so good [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1011.2199999999999s)]
*  Like yeah, this is all I I just had to do this. Yeah, it's wasn't painful. It's fun [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1016.62s)]
*  Yeah, and now I feel great and you're like fuck man two years [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1022.5s)]
*  Two years I went off of it. That's scary when you're you know, I mean when you when you're oscillating [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1026.98s)]
*  between those two modes, you know, and you don't want to get stuck in the devil's mode, but you [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1033.74s)]
*  You know, it's a possibility, you know [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1042.58s)]
*  You somehow glued yourself to that this one like you you don't seem to really like fall off, you know [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1044.86s)]
*  Did you at first? No [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1052.18s)]
*  it's necessary for me and [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1054.58s)]

*  Reality, yeah in the harmonious one. I think that probably I mean, I it's cynical to say but probably what like [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1261.46s)]
*  70% of people to some degree are [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1269.54s)]
*  Stuck in the gravity well of whatever those things it's a gravity well, that's that because that's the thing man, you know [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1273.98s)]
*  Climbing out of that fucking hole is the hardest part [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1281.78s)]
*  But that hole has its own gravity and the gravity is around addiction to just the stuff you're describing you're addicted to drama [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1286.02s)]
*  You're addicted to eating shitty food. You're addicted to like staying up late and doom-scrolling or whatever [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1293.3s)]
*  It's it's a gravity and so then you got to crawl out of it to get into that other place [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1299.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and you get in that other place and generally the first thing you think is god. This is incredible [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1306.14s)]
*  but then [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1310.58s)]
*  The more you stay in that place [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1312.14s)]
*  You kind of forget how bad it felt in the other place [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1314.5s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and that's where the pattern can like you get sucked back into the gravity. Well, you don't like stay [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1317.58s)]
*  Steady in the discipline. Yeah, I think that's a lot of people like that is it [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1323.94s)]
*  it's more people than not because our natural human instincts are to [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1329.06s)]
*  You know, it's like to squabble. Yeah, like there's natural squabble. Yeah built into people [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1333.02s)]
*  But it's a pattern of [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1339.66s)]
*  Behavior. It's a pattern of thinking you can recognize that it's a dangerous pattern or a shitty pattern or an unproductive pattern [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1341.94s)]
*  In overall a negative pattern. Yeah [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1349.5800000000002s)]
*  Just get it out of there. Yeah, just don't you can do that. I've done it you can do it people can do it [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1352.7s)]

*  Your own aggression. Yes, because if you don't then you trick yourself as [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1362.18s)]
*  You engage in some conversation. Yeah into thinking that there is an aggression behind it [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1368.02s)]

*  Like this once you start applying this to everybody and you realize like a lot of times we're like using a [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1603.98s)]
*  Mode of communication based on our experience with our particular job or business or whatever [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1611.4199999999998s)]
*  And trying to get other people right or or even your the way you were raised, right? This is you learn this mode of communication [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1616.8999999999999s)]
*  Potentially from lunatics like you can't choose where you're born. That's very true. And then those people enter into conversations [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1624.78s)]
*  thinking that everyone else understands [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1632.74s)]

*  Start up again, it's so cool man. Yeah, it's a really interesting thing [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1738.98s)]

*  Acknowledging how special it is like nobody's taking it for granted. Everybody's like are you kidding? Like yeah, we're do this is a possibility [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1770.4599999999998s)]
*  This is happening. Yeah, isn't it crazy that it was an idea and now it's a real thing. Yes was an idea [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1778.1s)]
*  Now it's a real thing. That's the I had the wildest idea about ideas once [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1783.26s)]
*  That what if ideas are a life form and the way they manifest in [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1788.8999999999999s)]
*  reality is [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1794.02s)]
*  they they get into a person's brain and then [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1795.34s)]
*  Influence that person to take action to create them the same way [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1800.06s)]
*  Like a parasite will get into a grasshopper's brain [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1805.46s)]
*  Yeah, like a water like those aquatic worms and they convinced the grasshopper to commit suicide so that they could be born like [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1809.74s)]
*  Weird shit happens with parasites [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1816.6200000000001s)]
*  What if ideas are a life form? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1818.8600000000001s)]
*  Is everything that exists that human beings have created just think about the fucking? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1821.22s)]
*  Immense amount of objects that we've created all of them came from ideas. Yeah, all of them [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1827.38s)]
*  And we think of this is my idea I had this idea [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1834.0600000000002s)]
*  But we both know that ideas are very strange [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1837.9s)]
*  They they come to you in the weirdest of ways. It's the reason why people believe in the muse [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1841.9s)]
*  It's the reason why Pressfield's book the war of art is so good. Yeah, because when he documents this sort of [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1847.8600000000001s)]
*  Journey that he goes on every day when he writes where he summons the muse [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1855.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he does it like it's in his mind. No, it's a real thing and then starts to write and [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1860.62s)]
*  And treats it like a ritual. Yeah, you're gonna be there all the time. What is happening there? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1868.02s)]
*  Like what what are you summoning when you get these ideas whether it's summoning something? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1873.3799999999999s)]
*  That's a creative work like literature or whether it's the invention that changes society forever [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1878.3s)]
*  Right, like all of them came from ideas [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1884.82s)]
*  Yeah, and a lot of them like a lot of like the great ideas like Tesla [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1887.52s)]
*  He just openly admits it came to him in a vision. Yeah, he saw it [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1892.9599999999998s)]
*  Like he doesn't even ascribe it to his own mind. It was like a vision [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1897.32s)]
*  Don't you feel that way about some of your best jokes that they just pop in your head? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1901.12s)]
*  yeah, but you know what you know, it's weird about Tesla and [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1906.1s)]
*  I'm sorry you guys if I'm wrong about this, but I I read it was blown away [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1911.1599999999999s)]
*  I think it was on his Wikipedia, but I could be wrong [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1915.4s)]
*  Apparently he was thinking about Faust when he had the vision now. I hope I'm not wrong about that you guys Jamie [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1918.4s)]
*  Jamie, would you mind? I'm sorry, dude? I I could be wrong and I'm sorry all if I am but the yeah [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1925.8000000000002s)]
*  So Faust is about you know an alchemist he makes the [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1931.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1936.5600000000002s)]
*  How poetry inspired Tesla to design one of his most important inventions? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1938.1200000000001s)]
*  Let's see [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1946.2s)]
*  There it is Faust. Yeah [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1947.76s)]
*  One of the lesser facts known one of the lesser known facts about Tesla's that he was also a great fan of poetry [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1950.2s)]
*  And it was an expert of [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1956.5600000000002s)]
*  Girda Girda Girda Faust [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1959.44s)]
*  Girda's Faust that inspired him to finalize his invention of the alternating current motor the term [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1962.2s)]
*  World-changing invention certainly applies this innovation. So what inspired that was? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1970.3200000000002s)]
*  poem I thought was a play a poem about an [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1976.0400000000002s)]
*  Alchemist selling his soul of the devil so all of modern technology [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1980.76s)]
*  originated from the inspiration that he derived from a poem about a satanic bargain [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1985.44s)]
*  Is that wild the Faustian bargain the Faustian bargain was the [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1992.96s)]
*  According to the person who invented it was the inspiration. Yeah for technology that we are still [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=1998.64s)]
*  Like using today like that. Yeah, so that so then you see then you go back and you think well [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2004.98s)]
*  What what inspired Girda, you know, and then you realize it's like this crazy [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2012.02s)]
*  Wave of like it ripples through time like you somebody gets a great and spur gets inspired writes it down [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2016.58s)]
*  It's beautiful. I [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2023.82s)]
*  Don't know how long passed between when he wrote that and Tesla had his vision but [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2025.98s)]
*  If certainly obviously Girda probably had no idea that when he [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2032.18s)]
*  Spent the time writing that thing and trusted to write it down [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2037.3400000000001s)]
*  He was gonna warp the entire planet his poem was gonna ripple out and warp the entire planet [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2040.54s)]
*  Just from a poem that's wild man [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2047.02s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? Is that nuts especially I mean, it's so meta you weren't wrong. It is a play but it's written in verse [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2050.78s)]
*  I [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2057.94s)]
*  Wow [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2060.46s)]
*  1808 1808 someone writes a cool poem about selling your soul to the devil [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2062.54s)]
*  Cut to now there's self-driving cars [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2069.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh my god [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2076.82s)]
*  Ideas are strange. I mean [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2080.18s)]
*  Even back to the club the idea of the club [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2082.5s)]
*  You know [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2085.6600000000003s)]
*  When we were all talking about doing it [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2086.94s)]
*  These ideas were just like yeah, and then we could do this and then we could do that [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2089.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, should we have this should we have that? Yeah, we we spent a fucking year and a half of doing this [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2095.1400000000003s)]
*  It was a long process before it actually got built. Well, that's the problem [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2101.46s)]
*  With ideas it's like they mimic and I'm not just saying this cuz my wife's pregnant [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2106.2200000000003s)]
*  They mimic childbirth in the sense that there's some kind of gestation period that's [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2110.7799999999997s)]
*  There's the end you're inseminated with your inspiration [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2115.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, then you got to start growing it and then the phases of growing it or can be like [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2118.7s)]
*  really torturous and long and like [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2125.22s)]
*  Somewhere in there you're like this sucks [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2128.66s)]
*  like this is really the dumbest thing of all time and then you keep working on it and maybe you realize that's true or [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2130.66s)]
*  You find that you fix it's like a puzzle [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2137.02s)]
*  Yeah, but that you know that is why so many people I think [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2139.54s)]
*  Are like letting inspiration come all over their face, but not letting it inside [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2143.3799999999997s)]

*  Anytime I [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=2176.06s)]

*  Because it's speaking fees are a way that you can give people money [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3140.8399999999997s)]
*  You can just give them money and they they perform a thing they talk and it can be the most uninspired [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3145.04s)]
*  Nonsenseical horseshit talk. It doesn't matter. They're gonna get a half a million dollars, right? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3151.6s)]
*  That's right [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3156.4s)]
*  That's just a normal amount of money that you get and then you go here and you make it over there and you go [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3157.3599999999997s)]
*  Here and you make it and you collect from everybody [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3162.1s)]

*  See, this is what I'm talking about man. This is the liminal or subliminal part of the human [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3171.64s)]

*  I mean just think about how silly it is that paper money [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3652.24s)]

*  You can't duplicate like no one can duplicate that like you have to make it so complex that I can't be [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3660.36s)]
*  Counterfeit and change it up. Yeah, they have like little things in them like you look at it a certain way with like yeah [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3666.92s)]
*  I've seen it. I mean it's gotten increasingly like, you know, you talk about the I love it that race the evolutionary race [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3674.24s)]
*  Like every time like gazelle has to get a little bit faster [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3681.52s)]
*  And then if it's getting faster the predator has to increase its speed [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3685.68s)]
*  And so there's like evolutionary pressure to like keep things going faster [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3688.7999999999997s)]
*  And then you have like the same thing with paper [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3693.3599999999997s)]
*  It's got to be like so they're like, okay, we solve the problem. We put a like triple hologram [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3695.7599999999998s)]
*  Underneath that is it would require 700 micro sheets of paper to duplicate [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3701.64s)]
*  Somebody's looking at that and being like how much money would it cost to duplicate that and they're like, oh probably a million dollars [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3707.7599999999998s)]
*  And they're like great. We'll pay for it with the money we print [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3713.56s)]
*  We'll take the loan print the money and pay for it and then they're like fuck they figured our duplication technique and then [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3717.08s)]
*  Or our hologram technique and then they're like fuck we got to put something else in there [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3723.08s)]
*  And then it's just a never-ending. I imagine like how long before we're a cashless society [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3726.88s)]
*  Hopefully forever, dude. I hope I hope forever. I hope we know like it is so scary to imagine [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3734.4s)]

*  Losing it all completely because every transaction is in the public eye or observable. That's really scary, man [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3748.96s)]
*  I mean, it's like I don't even do anything interesting with my money like except like [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3755.64s)]
*  Tip on the road like, you know, I use my card and I know that's the argument is that's traceable [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3760.6s)]
*  I ain't right realize that but it's scary because it there's an option [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3766.4s)]
*  You want to just like blow some cash on something you can't [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3770.48s)]

*  Right now that I would ever use cash for anything other than legal purposes. It's just like [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3777.72s)]
*  That you know what I mean? Like the like one day in the future. Everything will be traceable. That's right [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3782.64s)]
*  And that's you know, this is where I get this is where being raised in Episcopalian [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3788.12s)]
*  In the book of revelations is gonna is a Christian you're gonna read it [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3793.8s)]
*  This is where I get scared because it's too similar to the mark of the beast [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3797.84s)]
*  It's too similar to exactly what it says [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3802.68s)]
*  You won't be able to trade you won't be able to do anything unless you have the mark unless you bear the mark [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3805.08s)]
*  So what is that that that in that term in the house that describe? How's the mark of the beast described in the Bible? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3810.52s)]
*  We should read it because I think you're on to something. We're now officially podcasting [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3817.92s)]
*  This is fucking it. We're opening up the book of revelations [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3823.64s)]
*  Yeah [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3826.64s)]
*  Yeah, the mark of the beast it's like you can't do anything you can't sell you can't if you don't take the mark you're fucked I [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3830.92s)]
*  Mean that's that's that like if you remove [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3837.08s)]
*  The ability to trade currency in a private way. Yeah, you now can you you are now controlled [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3839.96s)]
*  You are now monitored. That's like or [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3846.88s)]
*  Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth it had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3848.88s)]
*  It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3854.6s)]
*  Whose mortal wound was healed it performs great signs even making fire come down from the heaven to earth in front of people [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3863.52s)]
*  And by the signs that it allowed to work in the presence of the beast it deceives those who dwell on earth [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3872.0s)]
*  Telling them to make an image for the beast that was wounded by the sword and yet lived [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3878.52s)]
*  And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3885.32s)]
*  So that the image of the beast might even speak and might be t cause those [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3889.08s)]
*  Who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3895.28s)]
*  Who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3898.68s)]
*  It also causes all both small and great both rich and poor both free and slave to be marked on the right hand or [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3902.92s)]
*  The forehead so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3910.7999999999997s)]
*  That is the name of the beast or the number of its name this calls for wisdom [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3917.48s)]
*  Let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3923.36s)]
*  Man and his number is 666 [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3930.44s)]
*  You know so wild about that stuff [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3937.56s)]
*  reading that is [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3940.72s)]
*  It's really clear that they spoke differently [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3942.24s)]
*  Yeah, and also really clear that you're getting a translation from another language [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3946.92s)]
*  Well, this is the best version of the English translation [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3953.44s)]
*  They should they could give us it gets weirder when you get to the original [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3956.96s)]
*  Like when you get to the original because like you know one of the reasons that seems weird is because that that's a that's a code [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=3959.7999999999997s)]

*  but the book of John is [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4156.86s)]
*  Matthew mark Luke synoptic gospels, they have the same stories in the mostly John not synoptic and [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4160.62s)]
*  has all this weird shit in it and [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4167.3s)]

*  They have within them something that I've always struggled with understanding the logic which is to be cleansed by the blood of Jesus [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4176.54s)]
*  sacrifice the God [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4183.58s)]

*  cleansed [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4188.58s)]
*  whereas book of John it has less of a focus on that and and or the redemption through the crucifixion and [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4189.66s)]
*  More saying the crucifixion itself [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4198.18s)]
*  was the ultimate because it was the like collision between light and darkness where light [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4201.26s)]
*  instead of getting aggro [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4208.38s)]
*  fighting back [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4210.900000000001s)]

*  Regardless that the book of revelations and all of that stuff [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4249.94s)]
*  I think it it clearly emanates from an expanded consciousness if nothing else like it you think there really was a Jesus [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4253.299999999999s)]
*  Well, I think you know, I read that [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4261.46s)]
*  controversial book by Reza Aslan [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4264.179999999999s)]

*  Apparently there are references to zealot and it's controversial [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4277.42s)]
*  I know some people don't like it, but I enjoyed it, but it says like apparently there are references to a Jesus [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4281.7s)]
*  but never described as [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4288.9s)]
*  Messiah but as a magician who was going around healing people and stuff [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4292.0599999999995s)]
*  so there is some reference to the the being but you know, I like I get so bored with the [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4296.86s)]
*  Attempt to find the historic [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4304.42s)]
*  Jesus because I think it really misses the point [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4307.38s)]
*  Altogether like I think like you get so caught up and like trying to like find the grail or whatever [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4311.46s)]
*  that you lose track of regardless of the [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4318.22s)]

*  Gnosis so to me, I don't care if just a lot of smart people who are trying to convey [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4351.58s)]
*  an ancient [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4358.62s)]
*  Cosmology [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4361.54s)]
*  Created like a character to embody that because I don't think that was to me. That's not the point [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4363.38s)]
*  I know for a lot of Christians it is and I don't mean to offend y'all [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4368.3s)]
*  It's just you know, I'm sure any Christian out there if you're not like wrestling with the Bible anyway [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4370.7s)]
*  You know, you should wrestle with it [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4376.18s)]
*  You're it's meant to train you or and get in your head and like grab you and confuse you and then it's a it's an amazing [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4378.099999999999s)]
*  Work it really is like the New Testament [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4385.18s)]
*  Wasn't one that one of the controversial [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4388.62s)]
*  Aspects of when Martin Luther translated it [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4391.7s)]
*  When they translated into phonetic language so that people didn't have to know Latin to yeah to read the Bible [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4395.42s)]
*  Yeah, they and he one of the more controversial things is he was like [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4402.5s)]
*  I think he was expressing something very similar to that that you're really supposed to like get out of it what you get out [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4406.22s)]
*  Of it. It's open to your interpretation [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4413.42s)]
*  I think it would it loses all its power if it requires an [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4416.139999999999s)]
*  actual flesh being and [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4421.98s)]
*  And I get why people want that and I understand I understand the argument but like to me with it written within it is [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4425.82s)]
*  Like, you know the communion for example, right? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4432.46s)]
*  Jesus never said [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4435.62s)]
*  Here's how we are gonna do communion. He did like say something really quite beautiful about which is like [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4437.5s)]
*  Exactly, like maybe the sweetest thing you can say to your friend if you're dying [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4444.9400000000005s)]
*  Which is when you eat good food [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4450.02s)]
*  Remember me and when you drink wine, I'm gonna be in that wine. Oh my god [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4454.02s)]
*  That's so sweet. It's so beautiful and it's like such an invitation for everybody anyone you can all eat [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4459.7s)]
*  I'm in your bread. I'm in like I'm in what the life it force itself [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4466.22s)]
*  To the point where you can connect with me just through [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4471.660000000001s)]
*  Basic like dietary stuff. Mmm. I love that. It's beautiful [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4475.42s)]
*  Like it's such a great way of fucking up the middleman the priest class the hierarchical bullshit. It's like no [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4480.06s)]
*  I'm here. I'm completely with you right now. Yeah, just you you gotta reach out and [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4486.4800000000005s)]
*  So these whoever what whoever wrote that I think that's what they were saying [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4492.740000000001s)]
*  It's like we're you're kind of in a weird part of the multiverse where it's easy to forget [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4497.099999999999s)]
*  There's a lot more going on than what you think is going on there [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4502.86s)]
*  Yeah, and it's easy to fall prey to all the tricks of that place because it's a tricky place that wants you to worship it [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4505.86s)]
*  And and and you don't have to do that [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4511.62s)]
*  Like that's beautiful. I so yeah, I don't care who it I don't care who [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4514.58s)]
*  Whoever wrote it or the people who wrote it or the you know, the how whatever the true story is [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4519.62s)]
*  it's gonna be a mystery forever, but [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4524.5199999999995s)]
*  It's such a fascinating mystery. It is like I wish I could read Aramaic and then read the the Dead Sea Scrolls [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4527.0599999999995s)]
*  God I know man because that's the oldest one we know of right as the oldest version of the biblical stories [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4535.46s)]
*  I'm pretty sure man. I mean I wouldn't I'm pretty sure I imagine there's fragments and stuff that like it's so fragmented that they had [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4541.82s)]
*  To use DNA to determine whether or not the scrolls were from the same cow [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4550.179999999999s)]
*  So like when you would find pieces of animal flesh that were from different cows, they knew okay [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4555.179999999999s)]

*  4,000 years old or something dude. I don't know. I have no idea. See how old the Dead Sea Scrolls are. I [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4577.74s)]

*  Fuck I mean, that's nature Wow [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4729.74s)]
*  It's it hold up [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4735.9s)]
*  Says the authority said these words differ slightly from other Bible versions shedding a rare light on how biblical text changed over time [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4737.98s)]
*  from its earliest form [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4745.42s)]
*  The dead the desi scrolls have a lot of really weird stuff in them like what? [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4747.74s)]
*  Well, you know the the Christian stuff the the the John Marco Allegro stuff from the sacred mushroom in the cross [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4752.62s)]
*  That's that's all his interpretation. I'm sure you would have to be a scholar to understand even what the fuck they're saying [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4759.78s)]
*  But he was essentially saying that you can trace back the word [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4766.98s)]
*  Christ to an ancient Sumerian word which means a mushroom covered in God's semen [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4771.0199999999995s)]
*  And he thinks that when God orgasmed on the earth things would blossom [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4776.62s)]
*  From it. This is like what the way ancient people used to think of when it rained [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4781.62s)]
*  They said literally think God was coming and then when those mushrooms would just appear out of the grass [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4786.46s)]
*  Which you know mushrooms grow really quickly, you know that yeah [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4792.22s)]
*  so when people would wake up in the morning and see these mushrooms after the rain and [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4795.78s)]
*  They would eat them and trip their fucking balls off. Yeah [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4800.74s)]
*  John Marco Allegro believed that this was the source of the original Christianity [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4805.34s)]
*  It was a lot. It was about psychedelic rituals and it was about fertility cults [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4811.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's about people trying to [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4817.18s)]
*  Trying to duplicate trying to have children. I [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4820.06s)]
*  Mean, you know, that's crazy, man [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4823.3s)]
*  Yeah, oh god, that would have been so fun the trip back then like it's from God's jizz [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4825.58s)]
*  Yeah, unless your knee breaks and there's no doctors [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4831.3s)]
*  Doesn't know nothing you just die [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4836.7s)]
*  infection die [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4838.82s)]
*  Yeah, there's some drawbacks. Oh, there's a lot of drawbacks on the drawbacks. No penicillin [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4840.3s)]
*  No antibiotics. No vitamins. No grocery stores. No hand washing. No hand washing [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4846.860000000001s)]
*  No knowledge of what what's going on with bacteria. They probably wash their hands [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4853.9400000000005s)]
*  Occasionally, I mean [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4859.9800000000005s)]
*  Killing fish. I'm sure there's shit. We're not doing right now [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4862.46s)]
*  As a species that we should be doing like some thing we're in the future [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4866.2s)]
*  They're like they didn't they didn't tap their pineal glands every morning, right? [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4870.4s)]
*  This one hack yeah just what a hack that makes you live longer, but yeah, man, I think if you explore [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4877.12s)]
*  the psychedelic universe as a as an existent place [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4884.96s)]
*  That is has its own consciousness its own mind and is interested in [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4889.4s)]
*  spreading itself into like little bubbles of [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4894.76s)]
*  Like I don't know parts of the universe that have forgotten about it [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4898.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, because that's the thing we get amnesia of it here. Everyone's amnesic to that reality [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4902.4s)]
*  It it exploring like, you know the idea that sometimes it wants to send a letter here [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4909.36s)]
*  It tries to break through not just with Jesus but with any like of what we call a messiah or prophet or whatever [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4914.88s)]
*  Oh, it's just some it's like a leak in the damn [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4920.72s)]
*  Separating us from eternity and paradise and these leaks appear in the form of people [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4924.72s)]
*  saying these things that run counter to power structures and [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4931.52s)]
*  Almost immediately the leak is sealed or crucified or whatever and then [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4936.8s)]
*  Whatever they were saying, it's co-opted and suddenly a hierarchy appears within the thing. So now you've got a priest class [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4942.08s)]
*  in Christianity, there's a there's a entire hierarchical systems of Christianity [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4948.24s)]
*  and that's fascinating to me because like the [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4953.68s)]
*  The thing that my understanding of it is like you don't really need a priest class. Like you don't need any you and me [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4956.96s)]
*  like you and truth [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4963.2s)]
*  you get to [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4965.68s)]
*  You get to hang out together [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4967.12s)]
*  You get to [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4969.28s)]
*  You get to hang out together without anybody. Yeah telling you actually that's not [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4970.8s)]
*  The real truth your mind is broken. Here's what brings us back to cults [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4976.24s)]
*  Yeah, when one person is the person who decides [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4981.12s)]
*  the way things should be and [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4985.04s)]
*  Yeah makes the rules [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4987.92s)]
*  The translations. Yeah, and they dressed like the pope [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4989.68s)]
*  They dress just like the pope. There's a well, I mean there's so many costumes for it [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4993.92s)]
*  Yeah, like but generally if you see someone wearing a costume and it's not halloween [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=4998.0s)]
*  You know or you're not at like a a convention [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5004.24s)]
*  You better watch the fuck out, especially if the person wearing a costume is telling you that [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5006.32s)]
*  they [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5012.88s)]
*  Are such an authority on this subject or that that you can't even fucking question it [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5014.32s)]
*  That you're questioning itself is offensive [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5020.32s)]
*  Now you got to watch out because if that's happening you could be in a cult like if someone's telling that to you if they're like [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5023.92s)]
*  We don't even ask that question [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5029.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's you better watch the fuck out because that once people start doing that man. Yeah, you know they shut down [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5031.6s)]
*  Then now they're shutting down the truth or the joy [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5039.6s)]
*  that comes from [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5043.360000000001s)]
*  Turning on the light in the darkness [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5045.76s)]
*  You know like the joy of when someone comes to you confused truly confused and you give them like real data that can change their lives [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5047.36s)]
*  You know what? I mean now you're ruining that possibility [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5055.92s)]
*  Not to mention you're telling people not to trust their rational mind [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5059.2s)]
*  Like the essence of who they are like could be off a little bit [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5062.4s)]
*  Gotta watch out man [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5067.2s)]

*  people in costumes [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5072.08s)]
*  It's just wild that it works police uniforms and [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5074.08s)]
*  You know look cops how to just wear guns and like a badge around their neck with regular clothes [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5079.36s)]
*  That would be a disaster because there's so many like at least now if you want to like impersonate a cop you gotta like go to [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5087.6s)]

*  Thing because it's just like an exercise and how well you can just keep pretending [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5215.36s)]
*  You know because you gotta pretend for a long time and you gotta tell people stories about where you went to school [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5221.28s)]

*  In this way now. I don't mean to compare spiritual teachers to ufc fighters [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5763.08s)]
*  But I think what they have in common potentially is discipline like real rigorous hardcore [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5766.599999999999s)]
*  focused discipline upon some system and [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5772.42s)]
*  With those teachers man, there's this like glowy [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5776.28s)]

*  Very authentic quality to them that inevitably you present to them something that's bothering you or or whatever [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5782.2s)]
*  And they have this way of just instantly shifting the energy around it so that you feel like it's manageable or you can [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5790.2s)]
*  It's not what you think you realize fuck man. I had framed this in this [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5797.08s)]
*  horrific way and they just have this ability to [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5800.9s)]
*  Shift that not like in a bullshit way like always look on the bright side kiddo, but a real compassionate [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5804.76s)]
*  What a way of like I feel like you do it to people sometimes like you see people and then [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5811.5s)]
*  Sometimes people are really good at seeing people [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5816.54s)]
*  but they're not good at forgiving what they see or they're not good at seeing like [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5819.66s)]
*  There's a possibility in anybody to be [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5824.94s)]
*  Happier yeah, right and seeing that possibility [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5828.86s)]
*  They just see the shit that's making them unhappy, you know and focus on that and and and those people are dicks [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5833.0199999999995s)]
*  But like some people can see through that to like where you you could be [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5840.139999999999s)]
*  And they believe you could get there and they do it effortlessly because they're trained [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5845.26s)]
*  They've trained themselves and being compassionate. Yeah, that's fucking incredible to be around that energy, man [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5849.58s)]
*  I mean, it's like a good feeling because like, you know when you're doing it [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5854.54s)]
*  It's not like you're all fake. Haha. He you get serious [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5858.54s)]
*  You know there and there's a seriousness to it when they're talking to you when you're having that kind of conversation. It's not [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=5861.98s)]

*  Yeah, no one would do that to a regular security guard, but you do it to a guy who used to be famous [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=6764.4s)]
*  You do it to a guy who used to have some right and now they don't and now you can just throw rocks at them [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=6771.2s)]

*  But if you had escaped [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=6787.12s)]

*  Yeah, so the boy so the kid's birthday gets turned into a commercial. What's that? Jamie's fucked up [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7015.679999999999s)]

*  The way they were doing it because it was making it harder for the pedophiles to watch kid videos to watch them some crazy [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7092.5s)]
*  Shit like that, but that's the other really fucked up aspect of it [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7098.9800000000005s)]

*  And turn it into money. That's a great way to put it and then pretend [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7338.58s)]
*  That the child is complicit you you trick yourself as a parent into thinking we're all on the same team [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7343.0599999999995s)]

*  You know just my kids don't like it [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7352.98s)]
*  Sometimes when we are just taking pictures and I don't blame them, you know [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7355.38s)]
*  I hate it when people take pictures and but they you know any parents taking pictures of their kids [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7359.14s)]
*  But sometimes my kids are like they don't want the phone and it's like, okay. Okay, no problem [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7363.54s)]

*  It's spooky people are so nuts with attention do you hear about that one guy that [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7378.0199999999995s)]
*  Crashed his plane on purpose for youtube views [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7383.38s)]
*  Yes, like he jumped out of the plane hiked like let it fucking crash [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7388.0199999999995s)]
*  For life for views for views [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7394.82s)]
*  I [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7397.78s)]
*  Mean, I guess when you're doing the math and you think it's a direct [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7398.9s)]
*  deliberately crashing plane to get youtube views so like [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7402.26s)]
*  This guy just jumped out of a fucking plane [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7406.42s)]
*  So like who knows [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7412.099999999999s)]
*  Whose kid that fucking plane is gonna slam into yeah, imagine you're hiking with your family [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7413.86s)]
*  This is amazing beautiful mountains so much and you get hit in the face by a plane [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7419.38s)]
*  By a plane that was like flown by a youtube influencer, why would I mean just ruin that plane too [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7424.82s)]
*  Well, I think the calculation is he knows the number of views [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7432.82s)]
*  He's gonna get on youtube will generate more money than the plane was worth [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7435.86s)]
*  So there's a profit there like whatever he paid for the plane is probably less than what he'll make from youtube from that video [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7439.139999999999s)]
*  And he got video footage of the plane crash [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7445.24s)]
*  See the camera on the plane [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7449.16s)]
*  It is so crazy. We could do this now that we can convert our lives into money [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7451.639999999999s)]
*  It's so crazy. You could like just film yourself doing shit and then like maybe make [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7456.28s)]
*  So much money off of like just stuff that you know normal stuff [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7462.04s)]
*  So was this guy trying to say that he [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7466.2s)]
*  the plane crash [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7469.719999999999s)]
*  Happened with him in it was he trying to like fake that [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7472.52s)]
*  And they hike out is that what he's what he's doing [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7475.56s)]
*  Or did he like let people know that he jumped out of the plane? [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7478.4400000000005s)]
*  All right, here's what he said. It was an accident that actually happened in 2021 [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7482.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, and they just found out about the whole investigation happened [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7486.76s)]
*  It's cool, man. There's there's videos of pilots [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7491.56s)]
*  Watching the video and like making commentary on what happened [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7494.92s)]
*  And like making commentary on why it's suspicious because like apparently you look at the plane [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7499.32s)]
*  And there's stuff that should be in a plane. That's not in a plane like expensive stuff [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7505.4s)]
*  Yeah, he said it just like he was acting like the engine went out and he had to bail [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7509.4s)]

*  huh [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7535.4800000000005s)]

*  Yeah for maybe a long time like yeah, like I think so [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7605.88s)]
*  Holy shit [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7610.68s)]
*  I mean we do need strict penalties for sure for to keep people from just just like dropping planes out of the sky on us [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7612.68s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, you got a subtle example for a guy like that and that guy could [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7620.04s)]
*  Dude, I mean who knows where that plane was. What happens if that plane catches wind? [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7625.400000000001s)]

*  When they were making youtube in the early days [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7644.12s)]
*  I don't think they ever thought that like there would be plane crashes because of their technology [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7646.84s)]
*  I don't think they ever thought like this thing is going to [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7652.12s)]
*  like [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7656.12s)]
*  influence [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7657.06s)]
*  Society and just destroy lives people are going to ruin their lives [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7658.44s)]
*  for for views [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7663.72s)]
*  On this thing [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7665.48s)]
*  Imagine that guy had a plot out where the plane was going to crash too [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7666.679999999999s)]
*  Because he had to be jumping high enough where you can jump [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7670.36s)]
*  I don't know what that threshold is but you got to be pretty high up there where you can jump and then film yourself [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7674.5199999999995s)]
*  Before you even pull the parachutes, right? So he's filming himself. Yeah, I mean it was a plan like he thought about that fucking plane is way [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7680.12s)]
*  Up there way up and that that sucker's how long? [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7687.16s)]

*  That's a he could have killed people easily percent [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7695.08s)]
*  I mean the assumption is no one's going to be out there, but I mean that's a huge assumption [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7698.5199999999995s)]
*  Such a huge assumption you could hit another plane you could do there's a lot of things are going to happen [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7702.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you're way up there and you're bailing out while it's way up there [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7706.5199999999995s)]
*  So it has to be up there enough where you could jump out. How high was it when he jumped out? Does it say? [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7711.64s)]
*  I'm looking for more details. You just said he was trying to get a sponsorship deal [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7716.92s)]

*  Doesn't say the name of it though, but [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7729.96s)]
*  What do you mean? You can kind of guess it says it's a wallet company. Oh god [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7732.599999999999s)]
*  Jesus christ, he's trying to get a sponsorship [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=7737.4s)]

*  Curing diseases [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8171.46s)]
*  And and the amount of time it might take for to get to that point with human brains [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8173.3s)]
*  Is way way longer than the ai brain is that the faustian bargain because in the process of giving up [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8178.5s)]
*  your [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8185.3s)]
*  Your the way you source information to artificial intelligence [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8186.42s)]
*  Then just starts to take control over other aspects of your life [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8190.42s)]

*  It really is it's crazy. It's like you barely can form sentences [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8206.34s)]
*  Like I don't even remember what we were talking about. I was just I had to pee so bad, dude [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8209.86s)]
*  I love that. We never remember what we're talking about. It's and it really I think is it like irrelevant honestly [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8214.34s)]
*  Ultimately because it's like what's on your mind right now. Yeah, just what's on your what's what's going what's on your mind the second man? [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8222.02s)]
*  It's just like fuck. I just you know [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8228.02s)]
*  The fact that like this is a conversation in like the ufo universe that's happening which is watching all these like hard core [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8233.78s)]
*  I'm still wearing a stethoscope. I just realized that my thing fell off the [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8239.78s)]
*  Like hardcore skeptics hardcore skeptics are now [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8243.7s)]
*  It's just interesting to watch and again until I see a ufo [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8249.78s)]
*  I'm going to be skeptical. Yeah, super skeptical, but it's interesting to watch the the gradual shift that's happening in people [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8253.220000000001s)]
*  Who are like big time debunkers? [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8260.02s)]
*  There is like not like okay. I think they're real and I don't blame him for saying [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8262.34s)]
*  I don't think they're real because it's like really what all your all they're still going off of like [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8266.34s)]
*  Just people saying it's real but the fact that the people saying it [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8270.66s)]
*  Like marco rubio coming out now. Did you see that shit, right? But isn't it interesting? This is my observation [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8274.42s)]
*  What they're saying is they talk to people who say this [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8280.9s)]
*  Right, that's everybody it's including grush [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8287.62s)]
*  grush is saying [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8290.82s)]
*  That he has access to information and he was aware of information. He was aware [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8293.060000000001s)]
*  Of things that the public wasn't aware of and so he wants to [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8299.06s)]
*  Be a whistleblower because the public deserves to know about these things [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8304.26s)]
*  Yeah, but he has no access to it. Well rubio said he talked to people in the government who said they had [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8308.58s)]
*  firsthand [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8315.36s)]
*  Mm-hmm, right, but he talked to people who said [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8316.9s)]
*  They saw the thing under oath though, right? Right, but where are those people? [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8321.22s)]
*  Like until those people are standing in front of the camera [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8326.18s)]
*  Going I was on the spaceship. Yeah, I [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8330.740000000002s)]
*  Met the entities they talked to me through telepathy. Yeah, I think we might be close [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8335.54s)]
*  they've got that hearing coming up and I and I and I know that um a lot of the [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8342.02s)]
*  uh, or I like to believe that a lot of the sort of uh [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8347.62s)]
*  Uh careful wording of things right now is is to protect people who worry that they'll get killed [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8351.38s)]
*  They have a sense of like shit, man. They're gonna kill me if I tell you this [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8358.179999999998s)]
*  but I because he did it i'm gonna come out and say it and [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8362.58s)]
*  You know, so they I think they feel like shit. We've got to be very very careful [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8366.98s)]
*  To protect these people. I don't see any benefit for any [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8371.14s)]
*  Body in the government to go on statement [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8375.539999999999s)]
*  Saying that they've talked to people within [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8379.14s)]
*  The u.s. Military who have seen ufos [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8381.94s)]
*  What's the benefit there? [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8385.22s)]
*  Like if it's not true, you're gonna look like the biggest dipshit on earth. You're gonna be ridiculed [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8387.38s)]
*  It's gonna ruin your career potentially as a politician [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8392.9s)]
*  So I don't see much of a benefit in them coming out and saying that stuff [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8396.1s)]
*  That's the part where it's like I can't trace the how marco rubio. What's he gonna the next time he runs? [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8400.1s)]
*  He's gonna be like i'm the guy who got tricked into thinking there was ufos, right? [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8406.82s)]
*  Yeah, it has to hit [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8411.54s)]
*  sort of a wall [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8413.3s)]
*  of uh public demand [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8415.3s)]
*  You know where the where the public demand is like, hey, what is enough people are talking about it? There's enough [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8417.86s)]
*  Whether it's commander david fravor or the new york times article jeremy corbel all these different [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8423.54s)]
*  Different videos that get released or there's enough credible people talking about it that they have to kind of address it [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8429.54s)]
*  And if someone like a senator like marco rubio has a conversation with someone when they're saying yeah [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8435.939999999999s)]
*  We have crashed ufos and we have alien bodies [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8441.539999999999s)]
*  And we're hiding it from the people. Yeah [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8446.099999999999s)]
*  Dude, and then that where this has been going on for 80 years [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8448.9s)]
*  Here's the deal if you are a politician and you realize we've all been briefed on this shit [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8452.82s)]
*  And it is coming out and you you other people don't have the guts to come out and say it [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8457.619999999999s)]
*  You realize to be the first politician [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8463.3s)]
*  Who came out and told the truth now there is benefit there. There's a lot of benefit and like the the courage [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8466.34s)]
*  To come out and like support whistleblowers because dude I read an analysis [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8473.94s)]
*  of it [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8479.779999999999s)]
*  That's so creepy because it points out that [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8480.74s)]
*  us taxpayer money [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8484.58s)]
*  Is being allocated to if it's true i'm saying [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8486.58s)]
*  Our taxpayer money is getting allocated to [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8491.22s)]
*  Some organizations that are outside the control of the u.s. Government this is and has been doing it for [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8496.02s)]
*  50 60 years [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8504.66s)]
*  This is unconstitutional like you can't [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8506.5s)]
*  Do that like what does that mean that that means that there is a second? [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8510.1s)]
*  Power structure within the government a truly like a secret [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8514.34s)]
*  Something and and that is like [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8518.74s)]
*  Be like you you we're paying for it and and if you're benefiting from the technology if you're selling the technology to private [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8521.220000000001s)]
*  contractors [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8528.24s)]
*  And making money off of it like that like that's supposed to be for us [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8529.7s)]
*  Free energy, whatever it may be. Yeah, so that is where it's [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8534.02s)]
*  Sinister sinister is well also imagine if you're the government [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8537.92s)]
*  Imagine if you're let's say the air force and you have control [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8541.380000000001s)]
*  Over some vehicle from another planet where you have [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8546.58s)]
*  If the the airport wants jets they don't make them [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8553.460000000001s)]
*  They hire someone to make them right. They have a military contractor that has all the engineers and all the expertise and [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8558.26s)]
*  They hire, you know all these people that actually make jets right, right? They need a jet. They buy a jet [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8564.74s)]
*  So if they acquire [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8570.82s)]
*  a spaceship [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8573.220000000001s)]
*  They're not going to hold on to it themselves. They they don't have [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8574.9s)]
*  The people to fuck with this thing. They're going to bring it to the people that make those things [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8578.74s)]
*  They go. Hey you guys make the stealth bomber. Tell me what the fuck this is right? [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8583.14s)]
*  Tell me what the fuck this is. Yeah [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8588.18s)]
*  Yeah, man, and and can we make one? [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8590.26s)]
*  And if we can't make one can we figure out how it runs? Yeah, at least tell us how it runs [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8593.38s)]
*  Do you have any idea? I heard that like [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8599.3s)]
*  Jeremy was on my podcast was talking about how uh, they um, sorry they uh [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8602.259999999998s)]

*  obviously like so forgive me if there's a [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8613.06s)]
*  Error in the way i'm saying it but uh, it like it's compartmentalized. Yeah, so some of the reverse engineering people [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8615.779999999999s)]
*  theoretically [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8622.64s)]
*  Don't even know [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8623.939999999999s)]
*  That they're looking at wreckage. That's what babla's are said on my podcast. He said [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8625.539999999999s)]
*  Uh part of the problem is like science can't exist in a vacuum science is collaborative [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8630.66s)]
*  And the metallurgy guys weren't talking to the propulsion guys. Nobody talked to anybody [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8635.78s)]
*  You had like an area where you're allowed to go and look at the vehicle [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8641.3s)]
*  And you know you were with your other teammate and everybody reported on everything that was said and done [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8646.9s)]
*  Yeah, man, and it just it was too limited for them to ever really figure out in his belief at that time [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8652.58s)]
*  So we're talking about [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8659.94s)]
*  1989 [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8661.44s)]
*  If what he's saying is true [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8662.66s)]
*  What he was saying was that they were bringing him to this area [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8665.060000000001s)]
*  And he couldn't tell his wife [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8669.140000000001s)]
*  He couldn't tell anybody where he was going and they were flying him to area s4 where they had this ufo [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8670.5s)]
*  They didn't have just one they had multiple ones [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8677.62s)]
*  and um [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8680.74s)]
*  This sort of aligns with what grush was saying because then grush what grush was saying is there's 12 of them. They have 12 [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8682.02s)]
*  Which is like [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8689.78s)]
*  Like for real for real or is this are you guys like sending money to ukraine? [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8691.300000000001s)]
*  You don't want me to know about so you're showing me this like that sounds so crazy [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8695.86s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I don't buy the distraction theory because it's like man [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8701.460000000001s)]
*  The u.s. Government's been doing weird shit with money. But here's the distraction. What if it's what if this is just an advanced drone program [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8705.060000000001s)]
*  and what the u.s. Government is doing with this advanced drone program to to obscure it that just [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8712.900000000001s)]
*  Start releasing ufo stuff and having whistleblowers come out that are actually intelligence agents [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8719.78s)]
*  And they come out and start talking about bullshit programs that don't even exist [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8725.060000000001s)]
*  Right, you know like they just start fucking with the people online, which they've done with other stuff [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8730.18s)]
*  Sure. I mean if you look at what they did with mk ultra [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8735.7s)]
*  Just mk ultra alone. You you should be at least you should go what? [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8738.820000000002s)]
*  What did you do? [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8743.86s)]
*  You guys set up whorehouses where you dose the johns and then film them through [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8744.74s)]
*  Through what is it? [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8751.78s)]
*  With see through double sided glass or whatever. Yeah [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8753.699999999999s)]
*  Double side that's the government. That's your tax dollars went for that that those were the fun days valuable research [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8757.3s)]
*  Do you get from dosing up some plumber looking to get his dick sucked? [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8763.3s)]
*  You know and give the guy a glass of water. It's got fucking acid in it [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8767.86s)]
*  God and you're in the cia [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8772.5s)]
*  You know how fun that is you're in the cia you're you're in like you're in the cia. You have infinite access to lsd [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8774.98s)]
*  They're just like letting you go into like brothels and like watch people fuck like wow [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8782.74s)]
*  Well, not only that you're a puppet master. You're literally giving people crazy powerful psychoactive drugs against their will [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8788.26s)]
*  And you're watching them and you're learning how to manipulate people's behavior and that's the tom o'neil the book chaos [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8796.74s)]
*  It's all about mk ultra doing that with manson and manson doing that with his followers [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8803.22s)]
*  Do you know the gifted and talented program conspiracy theory is connected? No gate theory were you ever in gifted and talented? No [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8808.98s)]
*  you know, it's a one of my favorite current conspiracy theories and uh [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8816.66s)]
*  Admittedly conspiracy theory in other words, it's just cool. I don't necessarily believe it [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8822.32s)]
*  but basically the idea like [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8827.859999999999s)]
*  The gay program apparently [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8829.94s)]
*  And I looked it up and there does seem to be some connection was sort of funded by [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8832.740000000002s)]
*  uh the feds who like the [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8837.86s)]
*  Like it was definitely somehow involved with the government basically not where it goes into conspiracy land [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8840.740000000002s)]
*  The idea is they wanted to find people [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8846.5s)]
*  kids early on who demonstrated certain traits that then [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8849.62s)]
*  They could hire to work in [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8854.5s)]
*  intelligence [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8857.04s)]
*  And so it's a grooming program for intelligence basically [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8858.18s)]
*  And so all these like and again, I I just love these things. I'm like if they're real or not, it's still cool [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8861.380000000001s)]
*  so there's all these like [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8867.94s)]
*  uh [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8869.460000000001s)]
*  Aspects of people who are in it like an occipital bulb like people who are in it [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8871.460000000001s)]
*  Like if you like they they have this bump on the back of their head weird marks like sort of like when them [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8875.94s)]
*  Navigation things or a serious xm radio antenna on your roof of your car [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8881.52s)]
*  Are [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8885.62s)]
*  Is that what it is [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8889.94s)]
*  Well, no, it's it's uh, well, yeah, it's maybe it's an implant maybe they give you that implant. That's where we go [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8892.02s)]
*  That's where it goes because they would spot for it would make you drink [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8898.42s)]
*  This weird pink shit [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8902.18s)]
*  They would like do this hearing weird pink shit. Yeah, I mean [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8904.26s)]
*  Jamie I bet you could find the whole list of like commonalities and people in the program and it's like [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8907.62s)]
*  Interesting like the hearing they had you would have to do this hearing test before you got in [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8913.52s)]
*  You would be in a windowless room or a room where the windows are covered up [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8919.06s)]
*  with a dude [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8923.699999999999s)]
*  Giving you an eye that's how I got in giving you [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8925.14s)]
*  Giving you an iq test the iq test had the esp cards in it along with a lot of other weird shit [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8928.66s)]
*  And then what would happen is because generally like smart people sometimes are are kids who meet these things are underperforming [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8936.34s)]
*  Your parents are fucking delighted. So you hear from school. They're like actually your kid isn't a complete fucking idiot as it turns out [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8942.84s)]
*  He's got a very high verbal iq and we think we should put him in this special [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8949.640000000001s)]
*  Program and so you're gonna be a fed. Well, yeah, I mean you're not you're not asking like wait, what is the program? [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8954.34s)]
*  Well, who came up with the idea for the program? You're just like my kid's smart. Yes, put them in there [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8961.0s)]
*  They care about kids duncan. Yeah, they just want to get those smarter kids [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8966.76s)]
*  Yeah, we're gonna put a lot of funding to making them smarter and smarter [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8970.76s)]
*  And we're gonna set up careers for them. Yeah, right in nicaragua and they'll never know [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8974.68s)]
*  They'll just think like when we came up to them in the college [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8979.960000000001s)]
*  They got a scholarship for that we provided and we're like, hey, we love [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8983.08s)]
*  your dissertation [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8988.12s)]
*  Can we talk to you about this really cool job? You'll never know you've been groomed your whole life to be in it again [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8990.6s)]
*  Probably not true but interesting an interesting like new conspiracy that I like a lot. It's really it's really interesting [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=8996.68s)]
*  I hope people out there research it for me because that's what I that's what drives me nuts about censorship online [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9003.720000000001s)]
*  Is that the really dumb ones that are obviously not real I think are also amazing. Yes. I think they're fun [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9011.08s)]
*  Do there's some people that are just out of their fucking minds? [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9019.0s)]
*  And then there's things that come up sometimes where you're like, wait a minute, how did that slip by? [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9023.0s)]
*  Mainstream news like how why is this not a subject that everybody's kind of tweaking about right? [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9031.060000000001s)]
*  Every now and then like the hollow earth one. I was like that is so ridiculous. That's so ridiculous, but [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9037.960000000001s)]
*  And it's still ridiculous it's still ridiculous, but then they discover there's three times as much water [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9045.560000000001s)]
*  Inside the earth. Yeah, then there is in the oceans. I got so excited about that one till I looked into it [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9052.52s)]
*  What is it? Apparently the water's like compressed sadly into the soil in other words [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9058.28s)]
*  Now I could be wrong about that, but I can remember specifically the disappointment that swept over [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9063.240000000002s)]
*  Oh, I thought they were saying there's like oceans under the surface. What I read is that a lot of the water [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9068.04s)]
*  They're talking about has been compressed into soil soil moist soil dude. I [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9073.160000000002s)]
*  When I one night when I was super high like I emailed a famous geologist because I had just read [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9079.72s)]
*  about like [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9086.92s)]
*  Caverns under the earth and I'm like my god like like [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9088.68s)]
*  Literally, there's like massive [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9093.38s)]
*  Empty spaces down there bigger than the Grand Canyon like could that be true? [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9096.52s)]
*  I just could I just still can't I didn't understand it and I don't know the answer for sure [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9101.16s)]
*  But you know, so look look at like, uh [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9105.8s)]

*  Studying the plumes of uh, europa. Is it europa to find organic life? We say within the ice of europa [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9111.4s)]
*  There could be organic life [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9119.24s)]
*  Here it is [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9121.8s)]
*  Sometimes scientists thinks [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9123.0s)]
*  Earth's oceans formed when icy comets hit the planet but new research suggests a different origin for the oceans [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9124.92s)]
*  They simply seeped out of the center of the earth [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9131.8s)]
*  The finding published in science suggests that a reservoir water hidden in the earth's mantle is more than 400 miles below the surface [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9135.08s)]
*  Try to refrain from imagining the expanses of underground seas all this water three times the volume of water on the surface [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9143.4s)]
*  Is trapped inside the rocks [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9151.720000000001s)]
*  sad [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9154.12s)]
*  So in this rock is water so that's what it's saying a piece of synthesis synthesized [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9157.480000000001s)]
*  Ringwadite the blue mineral may contain oceans worth of water in the earth's mantle [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9164.04s)]
*  Okay, but it's in the rock, right? It's so it's like it's not water. Stop lying like [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9170.220000000001s)]
*  That's like saying [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9177.1s)]
*  All the people on earth consist of an ocean of water because most people like what are we like 70% water? [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9178.7s)]
*  Yeah, right. There's an ocean of water in people. We just got to drain the water out of the people [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9184.62s)]

*  But there's three times as much water in these rocks as there is in the ocean [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9201.179999999998s)]
*  But yeah, but it's in rocks. It's not water unless it's water like you put in a glass [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9205.099999999999s)]

*  Don't destroy this for me joe, but but just [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9215.9s)]
*  Think about the fact that life [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9219.9s)]
*  Life grows in so many places, right and if there were voids within the earth and there was like some kind of heat source [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9224.460000000001s)]
*  Whatever it is and it gets hotter down there and maybe some water didn't just make it into the I mean caves are fucking wet [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9232.380000000001s)]
*  Right, so if there were water down there a heat source and also if there was like some [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9238.94s)]
*  Flow of water seeping in from you know, the surface [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9243.82s)]
*  Theoretically [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9247.640000000001s)]
*  Theoretically some life form could evolve down there just like we did [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9249.66s)]
*  Theoretically it might not be like advanced like us. It might just be some kind of like insane fungus [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9254.04s)]
*  My youngest really loves horror movies. We watch horror movies together. Yeah, and we watched the descent the other day [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9259.5s)]
*  That's a great movie. God damn. I forgot how fun that movie is. That's a fun. The descent too kind of sucks [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9266.86s)]

*  It's fucking great [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9291.42s)]
*  It's fucking I I highly recommend it. The descent is one of my faves like it's like it scratches a real specific itch for me [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9292.94s)]
*  It's like I love hollow earth shit and then like it just you've got well, that's not hollow earth [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9300.22s)]
*  It's caverns. It's like it's I mean it's beings that evolved in those caverns [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9305.42s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of ridiculous shit in it like they're grabbing elks and dragging them into the hole and eating them there [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9311.26s)]
*  Like yeah, the whole thing's so dumb [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9317.02s)]
*  You can't have a bunch of like weird like mutants living under your forest and so many of them too [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9319.34s)]
*  But [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9327.9s)]
*  I don't I think it was like another senator talking about the possibilities what these ufos are [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9328.78s)]
*  One of them said could be coming from an ancient civilization. That's just choosing to reveal itself to us now [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9334.06s)]
*  This was a government official saying this. Oh, I wanted to bring this up michael [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9339.5s)]
*  Nolas, I didn't watch the video but it was one of those things where the the headline of the youtube video [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9343.74s)]
*  it's like uh [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9349.26s)]
*  On the michael nolas nola show it's something about [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9350.62s)]
*  Aliens are demont confirms aliens are demonic [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9354.14s)]
*  Please yeah, but he was talking to somebody that like I think he was talking to lou [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9358.3s)]
*  Elizondo [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9363.320000000002s)]
*  Right who is a part of the program the the atip pro one of those ufo research programs [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9364.86s)]
*  Um, but there was this video about it [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9371.980000000001s)]
*  Do I need to make a feature-length documentary called what is a demon to teach matt walsh blog that extra-stressual aliens aren't real [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9377.18s)]
*  I would watch it [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9385.34s)]
*  Hmm. So matt walsh thinks are the other righties? [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9386.86s)]
*  Duking it out with each other. Is that what this is? I don't know but please make the documentary. He thinks they're not real [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9391.099999999999s)]
*  So michael nolas is saying that extra-stressual aliens aren't real. He thinks they're demons [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9397.42s)]
*  Intelligence officials now confirm that ufos of non-human origin have been recovered and studied [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9402.839999999998s)]
*  At this point the only reason to discount these reports in your own preconceived is your own preconceived belief that aliens can exist [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9409.099999999999s)]
*  The evidence is really overwhelming now and he's not wrong [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9416.06s)]
*  He's not wrong, but it's in here's the thing the evidence that we can get ahold of [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9419.74s)]
*  Is all anecdotal it's all people talking about these things [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9426.06s)]
*  Until it passes that i'm on this. Huh? [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9429.9s)]
*  I'm interested, but i'm not believing you yet. I've [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9433.66s)]
*  I know if you know about mk ultra if you know that they did that and they didn't get punished for it [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9438.54s)]
*  Those people just died [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9444.54s)]
*  So what happens does it evolve or does it stop right most things evolve like most [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9446.22s)]
*  When you go back to eisenhower warning about the industrial the military industrial complex like he was warning about it [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9452.3s)]
*  Then it was an emerging thing he was worrying about well that evolves to now control the government, right? [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9457.5s)]
*  Right, so does the mk ultra and mind control does that evolve? [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9463.019999999999s)]
*  Of course it evolves. It doesn't stop dead there. No, I was going to get people captivated [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9467.58s)]
*  Yeah [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9472.78s)]
*  I would start talking about all these things that we have all these fucking amazing crafts that we've recovered [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9473.740000000002s)]
*  But not show you jack shit [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9480.380000000001s)]
*  I have a lot of people talking about it and maybe this is just a preliminary step to showing you the stuff [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9482.220000000001s)]
*  Maybe i'm wrong. Maybe i'm wrong and these are like real patriots. I think the american public needs to know [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9487.5s)]
*  People have lived and died and not had this information and it's your duty as a patriot [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9493.34s)]
*  Is your duty as a human being as a citizen of earth to let everyone know that we're being visited [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9498.699999999999s)]
*  Also, you might be covering up for the military industrial complex [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9504.699999999999s)]
*  Let's figure out a way to make hypersonic drones that look and behave like something that was created on another planet [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9507.339999999998s)]
*  I mean, yeah, because they funded these researchers under some guys of a hedge phone company and [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9513.98s)]
*  Flown in all these physicists and give them a lot of money to shut the fuck up and top secret clearance [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9520.46s)]
*  Which you can't violate or you get put in jail and next thing you know [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9525.1s)]
*  You're developing some sort of magnetic propulsion system that can rocket things through the sky [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9529.26s)]
*  silently [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9535.4s)]
*  Instantaneously turn on a dime. Yeah. Well, you know, man, I think maybe [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9536.6s)]
*  that [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9541.66s)]
*  Some of what I know i'm doing with my skepticism in this regard is I just don't want to be disappointed [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9542.54s)]
*  Of course and I don't want to it's like I I so will love it [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9548.62s)]
*  If my kids get to live in a world where aliens aren't even weird, yeah [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9552.06s)]
*  And I want that world so [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9557.66s)]
*  So much that it's definitely going to give me some confirmation bias and it's definitely going to like warp [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9560.3s)]
*  Because it's so easy to see in something what you want there to be [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9566.06s)]
*  but [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9571.02s)]
*  I just I like I don't [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9572.14s)]
*  And i'm dumb, but I can't quite [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9575.58s)]
*  Access the real the benefit like I think there's other ways to lie about your [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9578.22s)]
*  Secret weapons [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9585.26s)]
*  Program then by like gaslighting senators under oath. I feel like that is such a dangerous thing to do and [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9587.5s)]
*  So to me it's unless you think that senator is a dork you want to get rid of them. I'll tell federman anything [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9596.3s)]
*  You know, I'll tell him anything I'll tell that dude I'll tell him i'm an alien i'm an alien we came to contact you basically [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9603.419999999998s)]

*  Meetings with him. He's an alien [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9612.699999999999s)]
*  Fuck federman isn't coming forward with this shit though, man. It's like he should be [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9615.259999999998s)]
*  He's got the information. He's just a coward you think fed they told federman. Yes. That's why he's pretending to be [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9619.58s)]
*  A person who doesn't talk that good, dude [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9626.699999999999s)]
*  He has too much information the best way to like not be credible like I don't want to be involved [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9629.34s)]
*  Yeah, man, I mean he would be a great person to like leak to you we told him [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9637.02s)]
*  Have you heard this theory being talked about are the aliens us ufos may be piloted by time traveling humans [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9641.42s)]
*  Yeah, i've heard that before I heard recent I was trying to find where I saw it [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9647.9s)]
*  But recently like in the last few days I saw someone I think they were in the government saying [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9650.54s)]
*  Government a similar version to this yeah [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9655.18s)]
*  There is a date that they have been told and that if they tell everyone the date it will freak people out [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9657.820000000002s)]
*  So there's a fight about talking about this date about when time travel gets invented [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9663.26s)]
*  Uh, no that they think that these aliens are whatever are us coming back to warn us and they're like this if they do [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9668.7s)]
*  About a time and fuck it up. Oh about a thing that we might do [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9675.5s)]
*  Yeah, and they have it they're very very vague and the thing I read about yeah, maybe it's like ukraine [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9678.86s)]
*  I mean jesus christ, but dude also if you do you see gretta thornburg went to uh ukraine [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9683.42s)]

*  The person they want to hear talk about this [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9721.26s)]
*  No, who do you want to hear talk about this? You want to hear like a rational? [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9723.34s)]
*  Educated scientist that's warning you about the very specific details of what human beings and our [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9727.08s)]
*  Our pollution [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9735.82s)]

*  On one level not thunberg. That's I mean the whole thing. The whole thing you just showed is like dystopian [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9752.460000000001s)]
*  It's strange, but but on one level [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9758.460000000001s)]
*  I get [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9761.66s)]
*  I know I know that scientists [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9763.18s)]
*  Are are scientists scientists are not comedians. You know what I mean? And I and I know that like [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9767.58s)]
*  many of them want to convey [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9775.66s)]
*  The shit they're discovering to people who didn't go to graduate school, right? [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9778.54s)]
*  And they need a mouthpiece like they need someone to speak [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9783.1s)]
*  For them and and and they just keep fucking it up [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9786.300000000001s)]

*  To to not make the people that they're talking to [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9802.14s)]
*  Feel like they're being talked down to right, but that's how they they hold authority [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9805.98s)]
*  The best way to hold authority is to make someone on the defensive make them feel stupid for questioning this [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9810.38s)]
*  And that's how you hold that authority. It's those anti-science like and you know [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9817.98s)]
*  Again, you go back and look at like tesla or fucking isaac newton [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9822.14s)]
*  What a lunatic he was a lunatic. He had mercury in his hair. He was studying the temple of solomon [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9825.74s)]
*  You know what I mean? And he had mercury in his hair. Yes, he did and and and he is what do you mean by that? [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9832.46s)]
*  Like when the hair samples when they did hair samples, I guess in his laboratory was mercury [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9838.38s)]
*  So he's had mercury poisoning mercury poisoning and and this is newtonian physics and it's like this [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9842.859999999999s)]
*  This is new look at tesla [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9849.34s)]
*  He's like fucking like on a date thinking about faust seeing a vision of like [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9851.66s)]
*  Alternating current engine, right? These are the people who warped society permanently. There was nothing tame [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9857.880000000001s)]

*  It's you know, the temple of solomon from the bible. I think it's a code. I think it's a code I could use to crack [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9874.460000000001s)]
*  Uh [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9879.98s)]
*  the the the source of all [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9881.26s)]
*  Reality and [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9883.960000000001s)]
*  I feel like it has something to do with mercury [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9885.98s)]
*  I'm just not sure what so i've been pouring mercury onto this replica of the temple of solomon [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9888.06s)]
*  You would you'll be really worried about me. I would be worried about this is isaac newton [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9893.18s)]
*  and and you know when so it's just weird this like [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9897.42s)]
*  This thing has emerged [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9901.58s)]

*  with maniacs maniacs [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9917.66s)]
*  Maniacs, yeah, and not maniacs who failed in their pursuit but using the system discovered truth that changed history forever [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9920.04s)]
*  It's really weird man. It's well [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9928.38s)]
*  We always want to think of a person as only being the thing that is so egregious about them or bizarre about them [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9929.82s)]
*  But there there are a lot of things [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9937.259999999998s)]
*  Right, you know, I mean that like when they talk about [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9940.06s)]
*  Like geniuses [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9945.419999999998s)]
*  That also were kind of crazy and did something fucked up like we want to concentrate on that crazy thing [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9947.339999999998s)]
*  Like wasn't tesla in love with a pigeon. Yeah, it wasn't some weird shit about a pigeon. Yeah [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9951.74s)]
*  Yeah [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9957.5s)]

*  You know asocial aspects of them they were all very bizarre and how they interacted with people [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9961.9s)]
*  That's right string of bad relationships. They had bad relationships duncan and ignore all the shit that they said that [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9967.9s)]
*  doesn't fit in to [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9975.42s)]
*  What like makes sense like his death tesla's death beam idea the idea that he could like create some resonance and send a death [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9977.98s)]
*  Beam to blow shit up or like probably good [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9985.02s)]
*  Well, I mean you should see that I feel like we already talked about this right we've talked about everything [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9987.82s)]
*  Have you seen the myth busters where they make? [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9992.300000000001s)]
*  One of these tesla resonance engines and put it on a fucking bridge [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9995.02s)]
*  And they're they're not expecting anything happening. Then the whole bridge starts fucking vibrating. Yeah [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=9999.02s)]
*  Like yeah, that's right. I remember that and they turned it off [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10004.22s)]
*  Like they they didn't they didn't continue the experiment because the bridge started like making some weird shaking thing. Like oh well, fuck [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10007.58s)]
*  Turn it off [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10014.300000000001s)]
*  You know man, I just think you're smarter than tesla. This didn't work. This is just quackery. He's open up a gate to hell [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10015.98s)]
*  Do you remember the event horizon one of my favorite science fiction horror movies of all time [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10024.539999999999s)]
*  It's a great movie. It's about these people that use this time warp [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10029.66s)]
*  You know, they they fold space time in order to travel and when they do [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10034.3s)]
*  One one ship disappears. So another ship goes to look for that ship [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10040.46s)]
*  And by doing that you open up a gate to hell by doing that [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10045.66s)]
*  Fold over space time so you can get straight from one point to another point instantaneously far across the galaxy [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10049.98s)]
*  haunted spaceship gate to hell and so everybody [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10057.42s)]
*  everybody has to deal with the [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10060.380000000001s)]
*  Literal hell like latin speaking demons and it's a fun movie [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10062.86s)]

*  id software that was a [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10124.78s)]

*  We're gonna have a lot of fun. Meanwhile, that is that queue that he opens up. That's a production queue [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10190.22s)]
*  It's not even a great queue. It's a joss [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10195.74s)]
*  It's supposed to be a bala bushka [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10199.5s)]
*  which is a handmade queue by this guy who is the master of [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10201.5s)]
*  The great queues like when you go back to guys like uh, yeah, see that's that's not that's eddie cohen's eddie cohen is like a real [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10206.22s)]
*  modern day [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10215.26s)]
*  Elite pool queue maker and he made a version like a color of money version [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10216.54s)]
*  But that's the that's the queue that joss made and you could buy it [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10220.78s)]
*  It's not like a I mean, it's a good playing queue. It's it plays good, but it's not a bala bushka [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10224.140000000001s)]
*  Balbuska was a handmade queue by this guy who was a master [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10229.5s)]
*  Yeah, who yeah, I mean they would age his wood [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10233.580000000002s)]
*  He would age his wood for years and slowly turn them down and you know, you'd have like stacks of wood [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10235.820000000002s)]
*  That had been [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10243.5s)]
*  Air drying for seven years before you cut them into queues [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10244.94s)]
*  Like his stuff was like it's like a violin. It's like you're buying a stratovarius. Like that's that's a real bala bushka [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10249.34s)]
*  dude, I just read this thing online of like [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10255.66s)]
*  coders making fun of [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10259.18s)]
*  The shit that pops up for like hackers. Oh, yeah, because they know everything they're doing and they're like, yeah, you know that [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10261.58s)]
*  That's when you have very deep knowledge or something because like in a million years [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10269.26s)]
*  I would never even think like I wonder if that really is a good queue [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10273.02s)]
*  That's that that's a good queue to play with but to rep to to have that say eddie gave me a bala bushka and show [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10275.900000000001s)]
*  that like [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10283.740000000002s)]
*  blah [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10284.86s)]
*  That's garbage. What that was was they made a deal with a pool queue manufacturer [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10286.060000000001s)]
*  Joss, which is a they make I mean very good queues. Don't get me wrong like [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10291.820000000002s)]
*  Mike seagull Mike seagull is one of the greatest players of all time [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10296.779999999999s)]
*  Played with the jaws. I mean they they make amazing queues. They play good, but they're made it with a computer [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10300.939999999999s)]
*  It's made, you know with machines, right? Yeah, the the the ends are rounded. That's a that's an old bala bushka [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10306.619999999999s)]
*  So that what that is is a title list and what a title list is is a house queue [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10313.9s)]
*  So you buy a house queue and a lot of those really old house queues from like the 50s [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10317.98s)]
*  They converted them into pool queues like two-piece queues that you could bring with you [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10324.14s)]
*  That was a very popular queue because it was it's a full splice [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10328.3s)]
*  Meaning the contact wood to wood contact of the two joints is like it's the the old method that they used to use [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10331.98s)]
*  That's cool, man. It looks like a [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10339.42s)]
*  very powerful wand and diablo [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10342.22s)]
*  Well, it's like you were playing not just with something that played well [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10346.86s)]
*  But you were playing with something that was art, right? It's it's functional art [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10351.02s)]
*  It was made by a master is made by in george bala bushka's case [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10355.42s)]
*  You know some guy had been making them in the very beginning [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10360.62s)]
*  Yeah, and willy mosconi played with one like the great players played with them [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10364.94s)]
*  but there's so many guys who make amazing pool queues now, it's like [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10370.86s)]
*  It's really a matter of taste and most of the players in fact now are playing with carbon fiber. Anyway [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10375.02s)]
*  What is the like this is probably dumb question because I don't know enough about pool, but what like if [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10380.14s)]
*  Two equally matched players are playing and one of them has one of those [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10386.539999999999s)]
*  And another one has just like a basic [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10390.939999999999s)]
*  pool queue [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10393.58s)]
*  How much of an advantage? [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10394.699999999999s)]
*  Would the person with a really nice none none no advantage. It's all about the archer not really the [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10397.02s)]
*  the the the the pool queue once you become accustomed to it, you know [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10404.46s)]
*  What it does [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10409.74s)]
*  So like every pool queue has a certain amount of flex [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10411.02s)]
*  Every pool queue has a certain amount of weight to it. There's a balance. They're all different [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10415.02s)]
*  But once your arm and your stroking arm becomes accustomed to the balance [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10419.58s)]
*  Then it can accurately determine the amount of force that it has to apply to the ball in order to get the proper [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10424.539999999999s)]
*  rotations of the ball for it to line [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10431.48s)]
*  Where you need to land your next shot, right? [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10434.38s)]
*  So it's it's a matter of making the ball and then moving the other ball to the other shot and any queue can do that [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10437.26s)]
*  It just you have to know what that queue does and then you have to compensate for what that queue does stiffer queues [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10443.02s)]
*  Have a different reaction the more flexible queues, right? [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10449.74s)]
*  Dude, it's such a you know what man with pool [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10453.66s)]
*  that's one that's got a pull golf [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10457.18s)]
*  pool [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10459.74s)]
*  it's got this like [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10460.94s)]
*  Oh man, yeah, you could just see how like you would just there was a I wish I could it's so sad [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10462.7s)]
*  I can't remember the name of this club because that green room is incredible. Sorry [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10468.220000000001s)]
*  They have a pool table in there and you know, I like I we would fuck around which is never fun for you [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10471.900000000001s)]
*  I'm sure because i'm horrible, but no, it's always fun. The uh, you know, I just found I see how addictive it is [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10476.78s)]
*  How like just learning how to do one thing and then you get stuck in this repetitive? [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10482.7s)]
*  Trying to get it to work, but it's so [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10487.58s)]
*  The difference it's mind cleansing it's like archery in that regard that when you're lined up on a shot [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10490.38s)]
*  The only thing you're thinking about is that shot, right? [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10495.9s)]
*  It helps me a lot with stress because I have so many things going on simultaneously that that would require my attention [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10497.98s)]
*  That if I have an activity whether it's archery [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10504.46s)]
*  martial arts or pool where you cannot think of anything other than that activity while you're engaging in it [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10507.26s)]
*  It's very beneficial clears your mind [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10514.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, man, I yeah, I need shit like that if I don't have something like that and it's such a relief [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10516.78s)]
*  When your mind gets grabbed by something. It's so great. That's why video games do have a role [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10522.140000000001s)]
*  There's a there is a good role in video games. Yeah, the problem is they're so good [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10528.060000000001s)]
*  They're so addictive they pull you in so far [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfW_rjccp-A&t=10532.62s)]
