*  I like to feel the caffeine. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=24.0s)]
*  Let's prepare glasses with ice for the second half of the show. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=25.0s)]
*  Once things start getting a little sideways. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=32.0s)]
*  So what's happening brother? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=33.0s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=34.0s)]
*  Great. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=35.0s)]
*  Great. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=36.0s)]
*  I've been on the road just going pretty hard with this hour and I love it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=37.0s)]
*  I still romanticize the road. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=41.0s)]
*  I still love it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=42.0s)]
*  And I did theaters last year for the first time ever. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=43.0s)]
*  Just the theater run. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=46.0s)]
*  So now I'm back in clubs to just tighten it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=47.0s)]
*  But it's, I love it man. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=49.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=51.0s)]
*  Clubs are the best. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=52.0s)]
*  It's the best experience. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=53.0s)]
*  The arenas are pretty nice. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=54.0s)]
*  They're fun. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=55.0s)]
*  In the round, they're really fun. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=56.0s)]
*  They look fun. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=57.0s)]
*  Theaters are fun but it's slightly removed from a club. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=58.0s)]
*  Club is better than a theater. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=62.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty cool. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=64.0s)]
*  I mean theaters, I forgot how intimate clubs were just doing theaters last year and being [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=66.0s)]
*  like, oh shit, I can see when a dude's frowning. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=72.0s)]
*  You know, I can see one person having a bad time now. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=74.0s)]
*  So I forgot about that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=77.0s)]
*  But there was a guy in Dallas over the weekend who just went to the theater. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=79.0s)]
*  He was like, oh, your girlfriend's the fan. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=82.0s)]
*  He doesn't like me. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=87.0s)]
*  He was just a drunk. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=89.0s)]
*  And I peeled out of him, he was drunk on rum too. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=91.0s)]
*  To me, it's funny. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=93.0s)]
*  That's a Jimmy Buffet drunk. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=95.0s)]
*  You don't see a lot of white dudes with goatees who are rum drunk. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=96.0s)]
*  So I was like, oh, all right. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=99.0s)]
*  He was eccentric. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=101.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was just a bad drunk. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=102.0s)]
*  But she was cool as hell. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=104.0s)]
*  Well, sometimes guys have a real hard time with their girlfriend being a fan of a guy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=105.0s)]
*  I feel like most of the people who like me are dudes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=111.0s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=113.0s)]
*  But when I see women out there, I'm like, great. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=114.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=116.0s)]
*  Yeah, who, ladies? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=117.0s)]
*  When I see a tabletop of four, I'm like, fuck yes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=118.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=120.0s)]
*  Whenever a lady asks me, are you Joe Rogan? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=121.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=124.0s)]
*  They're like, I'm a fan of your podcast. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=125.0s)]
*  I'm always like, that's crazy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=126.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=128.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure you have a lot of female. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=129.0s)]
*  It's a big pod. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=131.0s)]
*  It's the number two female podcast. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=132.0s)]
*  What's number one? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=134.0s)]
*  True Crime. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=135.0s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=136.0s)]
*  Like one of them true crime shows. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=137.0s)]
*  Women love true crime. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=138.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=139.0s)]
*  So women do listen to it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=140.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=141.0s)]
*  But it's not, you know, I'm a guy and I'm probably annoying. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=142.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=145.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=146.0s)]
*  Like if you're a woman and you don't, I mean, this is a bro heavy show. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=147.0s)]
*  You know, like when we do Protect Our Parks or when we do a fight companion or. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=151.0s)]
*  The fights are definitely for bros. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=155.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=157.0s)]
*  And then when I have fighters on, unless it's female fighters, I've had a bunch of female [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=158.0s)]
*  fighters on too. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=160.0s)]
*  You know, female fighters are probably my best example that I point out. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=161.0s)]
*  I'm like, this is the best example that I point to when people think that something [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=167.0s)]
*  horrible about fighting that it's like brutality and it's wrong and it's barbaric. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=170.0s)]
*  And I'll point them to some female fighters. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=174.0s)]
*  I'm like, just listen to this woman talk, like listen to Rose Nama, Eunice talk about [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=177.0s)]
*  fighting and like listen to her post fight speeches when she's telling everybody that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=181.0s)]
*  we just have to be nicer to each other. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=186.0s)]
*  It is pretty cool to be almost like Buddhist and a fighter. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=188.0s)]
*  She's an amazing, amazing human, very unusual human being. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=192.0s)]
*  You know, elite world class fighter, world champion multiple times and like one of the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=196.0s)]
*  sweetest, nicest people alive. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=202.0s)]
*  She's so nice to her opponents after fights. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=204.0s)]
*  I don't know a lot about fighting. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=207.0s)]
*  A lot of I've learned from hearing you talk and stuff. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=209.0s)]
*  But I and you know, I remember watching a fight with like Louis Gomez and Dave Smith once [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=211.0s)]
*  and they knew so much about it that that's how you get me into it, like backstory and stuff. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=215.0s)]
*  Yeah, like I'm an insane NBA fan. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=219.0s)]
*  I love sports, but yeah, I mean the camaraderie. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=221.0s)]
*  The camaraderie in that stuff to me is like what interests me also is like, you know, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=225.0s)]
*  growing up as a 90s basketball fan, these guys fucking hated each other, like wanted to fight [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=230.0s)]
*  like Oakley Rodman, they were like down to fight you and mind games and shit. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=235.0s)]
*  And now they all play AAU ball together. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=240.0s)]
*  So they're all buddies. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=242.0s)]
*  And that is so part of it's kind of lost a little. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=243.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=246.0s)]
*  Like the camaraderie is beautiful and it's not. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=247.0s)]
*  And now the trades are so often that like you're going to end up on this dude's team at some point anyway. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=249.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=254.0s)]
*  Well, I guess it's probably the best players can figure out how to always play as a team [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=255.0s)]
*  while playing their best. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=261.0s)]
*  You know, if your ego allows you to. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=264.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=266.0s)]
*  People are stubborn. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=267.0s)]
*  Like I'm definitely no basketball expert, but I when I watch like high performing athletics, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=268.0s)]
*  it's in a team sports environment. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=274.0s)]
*  It's always this dance between what is the best thing to do to score versus what do I want to do? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=276.0s)]
*  What do I want to do since I have the ball? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=283.0s)]
*  What do I want to try to show off? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=285.0s)]
*  Do I want to try to pull off something wild or do I pass? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=287.0s)]
*  You know, like what do I do? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=291.0s)]
*  And then people get upset when you don't make, you know, the ladder when you don't pass enough. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=292.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=297.0s)]
*  That's like a big one. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=298.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=299.0s)]
*  If you if you slow down, like, I mean, think about it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=300.0s)]
*  If you want to simplify it to like kids playing in the park, if you're playing your ass off on D [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=301.0s)]
*  and you have one dude just like ISO dribbling the whole time on offense, you're like you're you're wasting our energy. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=305.0s)]
*  You're being a dick. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=311.0s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=312.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I think there's always going to be guys like that that just want the ball. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=313.0s)]
*  But you have to know who you are. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=316.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like anything else. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=317.0s)]
*  Like, you know, if you know what's funny about you, you'll be a better comic. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=318.0s)]
*  Right. If you know what's what your purpose is as a basketball player, I'm a defender. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=322.0s)]
*  I'm a three point specialist. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=326.0s)]
*  Knowing who you are is all of it really, you know, is one of the classic fumbles of all time as a guy who talks shit while playing basketball and then gets his ass kicked. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=328.0s)]
*  Yeah. But it's so satisfying. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=337.0s)]
*  It's the worst thing ever. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=339.0s)]
*  I see people talking like Steph Curry. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=340.0s)]
*  I'm like, you know how this ends. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=342.0s)]
*  It's like shit talking Jack Reacher. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=344.0s)]
*  You're going to fucking lose. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=346.0s)]
*  So ridiculous. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=347.0s)]
*  Yeah. Why are you doing that? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=348.0s)]
*  People are so delusional. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=349.0s)]
*  Like the difference between a world class athlete and the average person is such a gap. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=351.0s)]
*  But then again, there's some people out there that just genetic freaks. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=357.0s)]
*  And, you know, they they probably, you know, are young and super cocky and they might be elite someday. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=363.0s)]
*  And they think they are right now. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=372.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=374.0s)]
*  You know, it's just like that's just a part of like being a male, you know, involved in competitive sports. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=375.0s)]
*  They're all just going after each other, whether it's with basketball or football or especially with fighting on the professional level. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=381.0s)]
*  It can be cool. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=387.0s)]
*  But when you play with your friends in the park and you have that one guy with anger problems and you're like, I had a friend who used to yell at people. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=388.0s)]
*  I'm like, dude, that guy's homeless. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=393.0s)]
*  You got to stop yelling at a homeless guy. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=395.0s)]
*  I had a friend who used to do that at the comedian softball game. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=397.0s)]
*  He would still do it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=400.0s)]
*  Him and this other dude who's also my friend doing scream in each other's faces, screaming like two gorillas, just screaming in each other's faces. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=401.0s)]
*  It was so ridiculous. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=411.0s)]
*  Some people need that to get them amped up. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=412.0s)]
*  Like Mike Michael Jordan would create shit. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=414.0s)]
*  He would create reasons to be mad at like there's a famous story about MJ where he like a guy was like he had a career night about against Michael Jordan, a career night, 39 points or something. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=416.0s)]
*  MJ had an off night. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=426.0s)]
*  And at the end of the game, he was like, good game to Michael Jordan. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=427.0s)]
*  Jordan was like, oh, I'm going to fucking kill him. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=431.0s)]
*  Like he said it like in his head sarcastically. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=434.0s)]
*  So the next time they played, Jordan annihilates him, like humiliates him. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=436.0s)]
*  And then it later came out. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=440.0s)]
*  The guy's like, I never said that. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=441.0s)]
*  I didn't say shit to Mike. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=443.0s)]
*  Jordan is so crazy. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=444.0s)]
*  He needs fuel to just be like, you wronged me in some way. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=445.0s)]
*  And that's how I'll. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=448.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=449.0s)]
*  He probably put it in his head that the guy did said that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=450.0s)]
*  Totally. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=453.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=454.0s)]
*  But that's like psychotic. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=455.0s)]
*  That's how you get to be Michael Jordan. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=456.0s)]
*  When you're the elite of the elite, that's just such a special mindset to be able to be that good at anything, whether it's Tiger Woods at golf or Michael Jordan at basketball or Mike Tyson and fighting to get that good at anything. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=458.0s)]
*  And that is so rare. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=473.0s)]
*  You ever require it requires so much insane focus on one goal. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=476.0s)]
*  And you're competing with what thousands and thousands of other elite athletes that also have their eye on this one goal. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=482.0s)]
*  Well, Tiger Woods is a great example of like it's almost like, you know, you're a kid and you learned you learn a language at like two years old and you're like, well, that could speak Spanish now. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=490.0s)]
*  It was easy for him. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=497.0s)]
*  That's what Tiger's dad did to him. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=498.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=500.0s)]
*  Golf. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=501.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, you just know that this is what it takes. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=502.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=504.0s)]
*  With golf. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=505.0s)]
*  And then of course you need to fuck 40,000 women. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=506.0s)]
*  You have to. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=509.0s)]
*  After that childhood. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=510.0s)]
*  Especially if you look like Tiger Woods. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=511.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=512.0s)]
*  And I mean, Jesus Christ. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=513.0s)]
*  Just let him have it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=514.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=515.0s)]
*  The whole thing's ridiculous. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=516.0s)]
*  But also it's like you see in that guy the difference between what elite athleticism applied to golf can, he got banged up. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=517.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=528.0s)]
*  Well, you don't hear about that many golfers that go through as many surgeries and either one surgery for his leg, but a bunch of its back stuff. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=529.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=536.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=537.0s)]
*  And you've got to think that fucking torque that guy puts in that club. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=538.0s)]
*  Like how many times can you do that before your back just goes fuck you? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=541.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=546.0s)]
*  You know, the way that guy hits a ball. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=547.0s)]
*  And he's one of those dudes where you're like growing up, I'd be like, oh, you'd be a fat golfer. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=549.0s)]
*  And then you see, no, your body will probably break down. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=553.0s)]
*  Tiger's fucking ripped. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=555.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's jacked. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=556.0s)]
*  Show me a video of him hitting like a long drive. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=557.0s)]
*  I was going to show you this, which is kind of, it's almost more impressive. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=561.0s)]
*  His ability to stop mid-swing. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=565.0s)]
*  Is this rear window? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=567.0s)]
*  Who's shooting this right here? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=568.0s)]
*  Well, this is like on field stuff. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=569.0s)]
*  But it's really, it's, I mean, why did he stop mid-swing? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=571.0s)]
*  Because either someone made a noise or something just distracted him. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=575.0s)]
*  But like you're already going and you're so torqued up by the time you're in the back there to stop is, it takes a lot. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=580.0s)]
*  It's just like a mental fortitude and then also to be able to stop without fucking up. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=588.0s)]
*  But it is kind of funny the abuse other athletes take compared to golfers. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=592.0s)]
*  Like this was probably heard. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=597.0s)]
*  If you're playing football. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=598.0s)]
*  Oh, physical abuse? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=599.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=600.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, verbal from an audience. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=601.0s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=602.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're playing, I used to do a podcast with Julian Edelman, who's a Super Bowl champ with the Patriots three times. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=603.0s)]
*  Great guy. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=607.0s)]
*  But he would tell me, yeah, they would throw dildos at me on the field in Buffalo because they hated me. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=608.0s)]
*  Now in golf, they're like quiet, quiet. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=614.0s)]
*  Like you can't take any noise. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=616.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's no noise. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=618.0s)]
*  It's a different focus. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=619.0s)]
*  But there is that one tournament that they do where it's a giant crowd. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=620.0s)]
*  Have you seen that one? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=624.0s)]
*  That problem with that this weekend. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=625.0s)]
*  They did it this week? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=626.0s)]
*  They had a problem? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=627.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=628.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=629.0s)]
*  They let in too many people and they stopped selling alcohol like one in the afternoon. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=630.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=632.0s)]
*  We're getting so fucked up. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=633.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=634.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=635.0s)]
*  It's like I mean, I don't know. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=636.0s)]
*  No one got hurt or anything. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=638.0s)]
*  Can you show a video? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=639.0s)]
*  I want to see a video of him hitting the ball first, but then I want to show Sam the video of this golf tournament. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=640.0s)]
*  Why there? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=646.0s)]
*  I mean, the dude, the way his whole body like swings that club, there's so much force. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=649.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=655.0s)]
*  Also, you see that emotion. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=656.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=658.0s)]
*  And the years of practice, like how many times has he swung a club? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=660.0s)]
*  I should say I know nothing about golf, but like he's a dude. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=664.0s)]
*  If he's playing, you're like, yeah, it's fucking cool to watch Tiger Woods. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=667.0s)]
*  It's cool to watch. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=670.0s)]
*  How does he play, Jamie, since he broke his leg? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=671.0s)]
*  He has played OK like he came since he broke his leg. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=674.0s)]
*  He hasn't played that many rounds really. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=677.0s)]
*  Apparently had a terrible leg break like really bad. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=680.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=683.0s)]
*  That's scary. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=684.0s)]
*  Is his son going to be good? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=685.0s)]
*  His son is good. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=687.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=688.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=689.0s)]
*  His son's out driving him now, which I don't know what that means really. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=690.0s)]
*  But like that's really good. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=695.0s)]
*  That's power at a young age. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=696.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=698.0s)]
*  This is that crazy hole, the 16th at the waste management. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=699.0s)]
*  So look at this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=701.0s)]
*  Phoenix Open. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=702.0s)]
*  Look at the crowd. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=703.0s)]
*  There's like a gigantic crowd and they're loud. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=704.0s)]
*  People are loud. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=706.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=707.0s)]
*  They make it like a big stadium. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=708.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=709.0s)]
*  It is pretty cool. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=710.0s)]
*  I mean, listen to that cheer for golf. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=715.0s)]
*  And some of the players like encourage it on this hole, you know. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=719.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=723.0s)]

*  Oh, shit. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=734.0s)]
*  See, that is so much more impressive to do that in front of a crowd. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=736.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=740.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, there's something kind of fucking cool about that. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=741.0s)]
*  You have to shut out the world. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=744.0s)]
*  I mean, that's that's a talent too. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=745.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=748.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=749.0s)]
*  Especially in something that's so touch oriented. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=750.0s)]
*  Like, you know, you just you're just you're concentrating on how many [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=754.0s)]
*  revolutions you're going to put on a ball on grass. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=757.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=760.0s)]
*  You know, it's like there's so much touch to it that any little. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=761.0s)]
*  You're fucked. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=764.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=766.0s)]
*  Golf and tennis. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=767.0s)]
*  I don't I've never been to either. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=768.0s)]
*  And I tennis when it's on TV, it's one of those I'm like, man, the shape [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=769.0s)]
*  you've got to be in. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=773.0s)]
*  This is the crowd when this was the last time. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=775.0s)]
*  This is so insane. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=777.0s)]
*  Look at this crowd. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=779.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is stressful. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=780.0s)]
*  Look how many people that is. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=781.0s)]
*  He's got to keep it together. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=783.0s)]
*  I think he had pretty much had it wrapped up by now, but you still have to [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=784.0s)]
*  make the last two shots. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=787.0s)]
*  You can easily fuck those up. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=789.0s)]
*  Dude, there's so many people. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=790.0s)]
*  That's so ridiculous. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=793.0s)]
*  What do you think of his dad? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=794.0s)]
*  I mean, it is a weird way to raise a child. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=795.0s)]
*  I'm not really familiar with exactly what happened. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=798.0s)]
*  Well, his dad just turned to me and said, you know, I'm going to go to [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=801.0s)]
*  the gym. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=804.0s)]
*  And his dad just turned him into Tiger Woods. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=805.0s)]
*  I mean, this is like it's almost like a superhero origin story. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=807.0s)]
*  I mean, you don't have if you become this, you don't have a good childhood. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=810.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=813.0s)]
*  And you probably also didn't have a choice. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=814.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=816.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=817.0s)]
*  But that's the question. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=818.0s)]
*  Is it different than being a stage mom? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=819.0s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=822.0s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=823.0s)]
*  Like how much is too much? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=824.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=825.0s)]
*  I mean, look at this. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=826.0s)]
*  It's just kind of dark. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=827.0s)]
*  He's two. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=830.0s)]
*  He has a golf club and he's two. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=831.0s)]
*  Bro, that's insane. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=835.0s)]
*  The doc is incredible. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=838.0s)]
*  It's on HBO. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=840.0s)]
*  I think it's incredible. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=841.0s)]
*  His form is immaculate at two. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=842.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=845.0s)]
*  But that's a lot of hours like, daddy, please let me watch cartoons. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=846.0s)]
*  And he's like, fuck you. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=851.0s)]
*  You're going to work on your swing. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=852.0s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of sad. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=853.0s)]
*  There's a little bit of that for sure. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=854.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=856.0s)]
*  You would like someone to just gravitate towards something. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=857.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=860.0s)]
*  And then you encourage them as far as they want to go with it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=861.0s)]
*  I think about it in sports a lot too where a guy like LeBron who came from absolutely [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=864.0s)]
*  nothing and became LeBron, he's got a son now who, first of all, being LeBron's son [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=868.0s)]
*  can't be easy. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=874.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=875.0s)]
*  It's got to be hard. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=876.0s)]
*  A lot of pressure. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=877.0s)]
*  A lot of pressure. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=878.0s)]
*  And he's a good player. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=879.0s)]
*  It looks like he's going to make the NBA, but you're not going to be LeBron. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=880.0s)]
*  Also, it's like, okay, you have every advantage. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=881.0s)]
*  You grew up in an incredible home. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=883.0s)]
*  You have trainers around the clock versus a guy who's like hungry as hell. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=885.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=889.0s)]
*  I mean, it's an interesting study if you had two guys with those talents and it's [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=890.0s)]
*  almost like a fucking Trading Places type thing maybe I'm thinking. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=894.0s)]
*  Like you put them, okay, which is better? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=897.0s)]
*  The hungry guy. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=901.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=902.0s)]
*  Hungry guy with good genetics wins every time. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=903.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=905.0s)]
*  Because he needs it. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=906.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=907.0s)]
*  It's a different mindset. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=908.0s)]
*  So it's got to be very difficult to engage in something like combat sports or [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=911.0s)]
*  pro football. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=915.0s)]
*  I'm not saying it's not possible, but it's got to be very difficult to do that [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=916.0s)]
*  if you come from a really comfortable environment. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=920.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=923.0s)]
*  You know, because you're just not going to have that certain level of anger [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=924.0s)]
*  necessary to get the job done. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=927.0s)]
*  And then in a combat sport, as you said, you need to shut that anger off at some [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=930.0s)]
*  point. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=933.0s)]
*  And that's got to, same with football. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=934.0s)]
*  That's a violent game, man. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=935.0s)]
*  Watching the Super Bowl, how many people on the 49ers, I was like, this is a [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=936.0s)]
*  fucking war. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=939.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=940.0s)]
*  People were just carried off on stretchers. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=941.0s)]
*  It felt like I was watching mash. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=942.0s)]
*  It was rough. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=944.0s)]
*  You don't see a lot of rich people's sons going into that line of work. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=946.0s)]
*  Well, Bill Lambier on the bad boy Pistons came from privilege, but then Isaiah [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=951.0s)]
*  Thomas, he's the general and he came from the worst fucking part of Chicago. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=955.0s)]
*  But that's kind of an interesting blend. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=960.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=963.0s)]
*  Yeah, it kind of is. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=964.0s)]
*  I mean, I could see how they could compete in some sports, but in combat sports, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=965.0s)]
*  like, the people that come from nothing have like extra gear. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=971.0s)]
*  They just have an extra gear. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=975.0s)]
*  What about a guy like Kimbo Slice, though, who's like really from nothing? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=977.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=980.0s)]
*  Well, also just talented boxer. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=983.0s)]
*  Kimbo Slice was a very, he had very good hands. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=985.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=988.0s)]
*  Like if you watch those videos of him out in the back parking areas where they [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=989.0s)]
*  would fight on like parking lots and backyards and like dodging satellite dishes [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=993.0s)]
*  and shit, you ever see those videos? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=998.0s)]
*  I've seen some of his stuff. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1000.0s)]
*  He's terrifying. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1001.0s)]
*  He's a good boxer, and he was boxing people that were not good boxers. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1002.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1006.0s)]
*  They just did not know how, you know, they were tough guys, but they weren't at [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1007.0s)]
*  his level, and he would just have these bare-knuckle backyard fights. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1011.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1015.0s)]
*  And the nicest fucking guy, too. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1016.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1018.0s)]
*  That's the thing about Kimbo, rest in peace. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1019.0s)]
*  He was the nicest guy, like super sweet guy, like very friendly to everybody, took pictures [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1021.0s)]
*  with everybody. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1026.0s)]
*  He's like not like a thug. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1027.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1028.0s)]
*  Just a really tough guy. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1029.0s)]
*  And so tough that he even entered into the ultimate fighter. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1031.0s)]
*  Like he really didn't have a backyard, I mean, he really didn't have a background, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1035.0s)]
*  rather, in grappling. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1039.0s)]
*  He wasn't really a grappler. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1040.0s)]
*  And now you kind of need that, right? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1041.0s)]
*  So he had to learn all that. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1042.0s)]
*  Well, he had to, yeah. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1043.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1044.0s)]
*  He got beat up by big country Roy Nelson, just took him down and got on top of him, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1045.0s)]
*  just kept punching him in the head, and he couldn't do anything about it. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1049.0s)]
*  He put him in a crucifix and just didn't know how to grapple. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1051.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1053.0s)]
*  Which is like so unfair. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1054.0s)]
*  Like to just, if bare-knuckle boxing was around like it is now, and Kimbo was around, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1056.0s)]
*  Kimbo would have been one of the best at bare-knuckle boxing. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1062.0s)]
*  He would have been, that was like really where his skill set is, was with his hands and his toughness. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1066.0s)]
*  He really wasn't a kicker, he really wasn't a grappler. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1072.0s)]
*  He had to learn all that stuff. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1075.0s)]
*  That didn't come natural to him. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1076.0s)]
*  I mean, it's really like just being around at the right time. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1078.0s)]
*  If you're just a boxer versus now, it's like being a silent film star, and then now they're talking. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1080.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1085.0s)]
*  Now they're kicking. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1086.0s)]
*  Now they're grappling. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1087.0s)]
*  Now they're doing everything. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1088.0s)]
*  You have to adapt. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1089.0s)]
*  But those fights that he was having weren't like, they were just backyard fights. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1090.0s)]
*  They weren't organized in the sense of there was no athletic commission involved or anything like that. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1094.0s)]
*  So once he started fighting, like he wanted to fight in the UFC, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1101.0s)]
*  he fought for a while in Elite XC, and he fought some good fighters over there, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1106.0s)]
*  and then came over to the UFC and did the Ultimate Fighter. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1111.0s)]
*  It's like a very ballsy thing to do, to try to learn grappling and fight in front of the world. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1115.0s)]
*  Because really he did not have that much grappling. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1124.0s)]
*  And that's such a giant disadvantage amongst those giant dudes in his division. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1127.0s)]
*  These guys are so big. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1133.0s)]
*  These guys are just taking each other down and beating the shit out of you. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1134.0s)]
*  It's like that guy who boxed against Jake Paul, one of the first guys, who was a wrestler. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1138.0s)]
*  The guy who's a really good wrestler. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1142.0s)]
*  Ben Askren? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1144.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1146.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just a different thing. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1147.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, Ben, I think Ben just took a payday. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1148.0s)]
*  I think he just gave it a go for the money. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1151.0s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1154.0s)]
*  He's an amazing wrestler, but he's not really known for being a striker. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1156.0s)]
*  That must be so fucking annoying to be amazing at one thing, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1161.0s)]
*  and then you have to do another thing that you suck at. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1164.0s)]
*  Some guys pick it up really quick. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1167.0s)]
*  There's some athletes, for whatever reason, they're just really good at learning new skills. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1170.0s)]
*  Like really good at learning how to kick, really good at learning how to punch. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1176.0s)]
*  Some wrestlers like Bo Nicol picked it up really quick. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1180.0s)]
*  In a couple of years, he looked really good on his feet. Like dangerous. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1184.0s)]
*  But then there's some that, for whatever reason, maybe their style of grappling was more controlled-based [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1188.0s)]
*  and less dynamic and not as explosive and changing from move to move. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1194.0s)]
*  Because some guys just have a slow pressure wrestling game, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1199.0s)]
*  and those guys just can never get the punches flowing. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1203.0s)]
*  Everything's just all bunched up. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1207.0s)]
*  They're just so used to grabbing and squeezing things [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1209.0s)]
*  that the idea of being loose and punching, it doesn't make sense to them. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1213.0s)]
*  It doesn't work with their body. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1217.0s)]
*  You have to retrain your body. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1218.0s)]
*  It's so weird when I see a guy lunging, I'm like, oh. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1220.0s)]
*  It's like when you see a baseball player reaching, you're like, that's not how you... [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1222.0s)]
*  Not that I know how to fucking throw a punch, but you know. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1225.0s)]
*  It's a dangerous game to not be good at. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1228.0s)]
*  It's the most dangerous game to not be good at. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1231.0s)]
*  If you want to learn how to do it, you got to really... [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1234.0s)]
*  Before you start competing, you better really know how to do everything. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1237.0s)]
*  At this stage of the game, there's just too many people that can shut down one aspect of your game. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1241.0s)]
*  If you don't have a ground game, they're going to figure you out, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1246.0s)]
*  and they're going to take you down. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1249.0s)]
*  They're strong at you. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1250.0s)]
*  And if you don't have a stand-up game, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1251.0s)]
*  they're going to keep it in the feet and beat the shit out of you. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1254.0s)]
*  They're going to figure it out. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1256.0s)]
*  You can't have any holes in your game at all. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1257.0s)]
*  You got to be like Mighty Mouse. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1259.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't be one-dimensional. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1260.0s)]
*  You got to be able to do everything. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1262.0s)]
*  It's like comedy now. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1263.0s)]
*  You got to do everything. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1264.0s)]
*  You can't just do stand-up. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1265.0s)]
*  You can't just podcast. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1267.0s)]
*  You can't just try to do movies. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1268.0s)]
*  You really have to do other shit. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1270.0s)]
*  You probably should, just so you don't want... [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1272.0s)]
*  You don't want to be confined to one thing that you do if you have options. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1274.0s)]
*  It's just more fun to do different stuff. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1278.0s)]
*  It's more fun to do extra stuff. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1280.0s)]
*  It's good to challenge yourself, too. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1282.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1284.0s)]
*  It's just fun. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1285.0s)]
*  It just makes it more interesting to do different things. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1286.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like walking a different route home every day. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1288.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1291.0s)]
*  Okay, I've walked this way home. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1292.0s)]
*  Let's see what this route does for me. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1294.0s)]
*  You know, it's just better for your brain, I think. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1296.0s)]
*  It's definitely better for your brain. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1298.0s)]
*  I think it's just, as a comic, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1300.0s)]
*  you could just get too locked into just doing stand-up all the time. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1302.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1306.0s)]
*  That could kind of fuck your head off. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1307.0s)]
*  I'm realizing I do it too much, and I'm like, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1309.0s)]
*  in terms of the road, it burns you out. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1311.0s)]
*  You run out of shit to talk about. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1313.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1315.0s)]
*  Because it's been, you know, you work so hard to get to a place [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1316.0s)]
*  where you're always working, and then you get there, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1318.0s)]
*  and you're like, oh, I've got to live a life. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1320.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1322.0s)]
*  I have to have shit to talk about. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1323.0s)]
*  Otherwise, you start faking it. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1324.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1326.0s)]
*  You start faking what you're interested in. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1327.0s)]
*  You start pretending. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1330.0s)]
*  You start talking about things you think they'll be interested in. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1332.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1335.0s)]
*  You don't know what the fuck is going on in the world anymore. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1336.0s)]
*  You've just been doing hotel to hotel, club to club. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1338.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1341.0s)]
*  Kind of losing your mind. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1342.0s)]
*  I ran into Chris Rock on the street once, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1343.0s)]
*  and I told him, I finally took my first vacation ever, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1345.0s)]
*  and he goes, oh, man, good for you. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1347.0s)]
*  He's like, got to take a vacation. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1349.0s)]
*  Even LeBron has an off season. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1351.0s)]
*  Wise words. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1353.0s)]
*  Very wise words. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1355.0s)]
*  Smart. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1356.0s)]
*  I mean, you burn yourself out. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1357.0s)]
*  But when you reach that level of a guy like Chris Rock, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1359.0s)]
*  they just know what it takes. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1363.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1365.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you don't burn yourself out. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1366.0s)]
*  I mean, he's got a different... [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1368.0s)]
*  He's like, I'll do a movie in this time to not burn out. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1370.0s)]
*  He's got a different career, but he's got wisdom. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1372.0s)]
*  Yeah, and that's also another very cool thing [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1377.0s)]
*  that you could still do something creatively that's different than that. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1380.0s)]
*  You can direct something if you wanted to. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1383.0s)]
*  I want to do other stuff. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1385.0s)]
*  Stand-up's always number one, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1386.0s)]
*  and I think, thank God for stand-up, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1387.0s)]
*  because sometimes I try to make... [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1389.0s)]
*  I'm trying to make a show now, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1390.0s)]
*  and the amount of fucking emails back and forth, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1392.0s)]
*  the amount of meetings, this, that... [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1394.0s)]
*  So much work. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1396.0s)]
*  And I'm like, man, if this was all I had, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1397.0s)]
*  I'd fucking put a bullet in my head, honestly. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1399.0s)]
*  I really would. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1401.0s)]
*  Because the amount of people that are like, oh, they're on vacation. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1402.0s)]
*  There's a Jewish holiday. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1404.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm Jewish. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1405.0s)]
*  I've never heard of that holiday. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1406.0s)]
*  That's not a holiday. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1407.0s)]
*  I don't know what the hell you're talking about. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1408.0s)]
*  You know, and then we got MLK Day, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1410.0s)]
*  then you shut down for Valentine's Day? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1412.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1414.0s)]
*  There's always something. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1415.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1416.0s)]
*  So, you know, thank God for stand-up. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1417.0s)]
*  It's like, it's always there. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1420.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1422.0s)]
*  Just like... [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1427.0s)]
*  What a fucking weird time it is today. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1429.0s)]
*  What a weird time it is to tell jokes. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1432.0s)]
*  Just in the culture right now? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1436.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1438.0s)]
*  It's just such a... [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1439.0s)]
*  It's just such a strange fucking time. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1440.0s)]
*  You know, it's a... [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1443.0s)]
*  It's a strange time to be doing stand-up. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1444.0s)]
*  It's always a strange time to be... [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1446.0s)]
*  I mean, I think during the Crusades, it was weird to be funny. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1447.0s)]
*  I think it's always a weird time. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1450.0s)]
*  It was probably so dangerous. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1451.0s)]
*  I think it's always a bad time to be... [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1452.0s)]
*  You know, but man, is it... [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1454.0s)]
*  People really need it right now. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1456.0s)]
*  It's great. I love it. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1457.0s)]
*  Like, I love that cities will surprise you. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1458.0s)]
*  That's my favorite thing. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1461.0s)]
*  Like, I never go in... [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1462.0s)]
*  Look, I've gone in judging a city, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1464.0s)]
*  because I've had a bad time there, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1466.0s)]
*  and I'm like, let's give it another shot. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1467.0s)]
*  But I never prejudge. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1469.0s)]
*  And then you find little golden nuggets. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1471.0s)]
*  I was at the Omaha Funny Bone a couple weeks ago. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1474.0s)]
*  I fucking love that club. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1476.0s)]
*  There's a lot of great clubs in this country. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1478.0s)]
*  So many great clubs, and... [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1479.0s)]
*  The repetition is necessary. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1483.0s)]
*  That's the fucking beauty of this still, is like... [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1484.0s)]
*  I think I've cracked a story, and then I'm like, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1487.0s)]
*  oh, that wasn't the ending. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1489.0s)]
*  You just find it out on stage sometimes, you know? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1490.0s)]
*  And you tighten things up sometimes. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1493.0s)]
*  You just take a chunk out, and they're like, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1494.0s)]
*  oh, this is way better this way. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1496.0s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes your ego keeps a chunk in. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1497.0s)]
*  And you're like, this is for me. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1499.0s)]
*  And you realize, like, that's also... [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1501.0s)]
*  We're the only type of entertainment where, like, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1502.0s)]
*  the crowd is really part of the editing process. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1504.0s)]
*  Scorsese's not, you know, workshopping his shit in Omaha. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1507.0s)]
*  You know, like, we're taking our shit all over the country [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1511.0s)]
*  to make sure this works. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1513.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1515.0s)]
*  It's really interesting that way. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1516.0s)]
*  Like, music is not made that way. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1517.0s)]
*  No. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1519.0s)]
*  It's really the only art form that's made that way. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1520.0s)]
*  And you know, it's really interesting that so many people love it, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1523.0s)]
*  but there's no real formal study of it by anybody that knows how to do it. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1526.0s)]
*  But it's getting there. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1531.0s)]
*  Kind of. I think there's... [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1532.0s)]
*  All the studies are so boring. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1533.0s)]
*  If you read, like, Simon Critchley, I think it's on humor, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1534.0s)]
*  you're like, I'm so bored. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1537.0s)]
*  You hear Freud talk about humor. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1538.0s)]
*  You're like, yeah, dude, it's about tension release. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1540.0s)]
*  No shit. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1542.0s)]
*  It's fucking boring when you read... [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1543.0s)]
*  When you read people dissecting comedy, like, it can get boring. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1544.0s)]
*  It's not just about tension release, though. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1548.0s)]
*  Oh, there's so much more. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1550.0s)]
*  There's a thing going on when someone's killing, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1551.0s)]
*  and I liken it to a mass hypnosis. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1554.0s)]
*  You know, like, if someone like Joey Diaz is on stage and he's crushing, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1557.0s)]
*  like, you're under a spell. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1561.0s)]
*  You're under a spell. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1563.0s)]
*  You're in his mind. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1564.0s)]
*  A rhythm, too. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1566.0s)]
*  It's like you're lulled. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1567.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1568.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's the cool thing about comics, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1569.0s)]
*  is guys like Nate Bargatzi or something like that, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1570.0s)]
*  where the jokes, like, he has a rhythm that's so unique. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1572.0s)]
*  You're like, oh, I'm just like, I'm just under his spell. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1575.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1578.0s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1579.0s)]
*  It's kind of like a hypnosis. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1580.0s)]
*  It really is. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1582.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1583.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1584.0s)]
*  And then we're just trying to piece it together [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1585.0s)]
*  in the most, like, digestible way possible. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1587.0s)]
*  The way that has the best impact. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1590.0s)]
*  Make sure you scour all the corners. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1592.0s)]
*  Make sure you cover all the angles. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1594.0s)]
*  Clear the room. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1597.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1598.0s)]
*  It's great, man. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1599.0s)]
*  It's a great time. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1600.0s)]
*  And the road is people really fucking... [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1601.0s)]
*  Like, we are in a boom. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1605.0s)]
*  I mean, you started this. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1607.0s)]
*  It wasn't like this, right? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1608.0s)]
*  When I started Stand Up? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1610.0s)]
*  No, no, nothing like this. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1612.0s)]
*  No. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1614.0s)]
*  No, this is the craziest comedy boom ever because of YouTube. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1615.0s)]
*  Because of YouTube for podcasts, YouTube for comedy specials, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1618.0s)]
*  and then for Netflix. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1623.0s)]
*  Netflix, it made it a boom, too. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1625.0s)]
*  There's, like, so many people that can travel now. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1627.0s)]
*  It used to be, like, there wasn't that many people [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1629.0s)]
*  that did theaters. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1632.0s)]
*  You know, when I was coming up, nobody did theaters. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1634.0s)]
*  I saw Rich Jenny when he was at his prime, when he was on HBO. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1637.0s)]
*  I was in a comedy club. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1641.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1642.0s)]
*  He was a funny dude. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1643.0s)]
*  Oh, my God, he was amazing, dude. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1644.0s)]
*  He was amazing. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1645.0s)]
*  Underappreciated. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1646.0s)]
*  Super underappreciated. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1647.0s)]
*  I sing his praises all the time. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1648.0s)]
*  I was coming home once from the Irvine Improv, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1650.0s)]
*  and my Bluetooth just randomly went to a Richard Jenny bit. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1652.0s)]
*  Just, you know, like, randomly. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1655.0s)]
*  You know, sometimes it'll go to a song. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1656.0s)]
*  It just went to Richard Jenny because it was on my iTunes thing. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1658.0s)]
*  And I went, God damn, I forgot how good this was. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1661.0s)]
*  It was this bit about how he's a fence sitter. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1665.0s)]
*  It was this bit about, like, shitting on all of the liberals [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1668.0s)]
*  and then shitting on all the Republicans [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1672.0s)]
*  and then shitting on himself. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1674.0s)]
*  It's just, I'm like, God damn, he was good. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1675.0s)]
*  And so then I ordered the whole album on iTunes, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1678.0s)]
*  and I listened to the whole thing on the way home. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1681.0s)]
*  It's so cool. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1683.0s)]
*  It's like, it's an incredible album. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1684.0s)]
*  By the way, I love when it's on shuffle, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1685.0s)]
*  and you hear, like, it goes from, like, a Tom Waits song [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1686.0s)]
*  to, like, Nick DePaulo, and you're like, that was fucking, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1688.0s)]
*  that was a big right turn right there. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1690.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1691.0s)]
*  I think it's a steaming pile of me. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1692.0s)]
*  I think that's the one that I downloaded. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1694.0s)]
*  Fuck, and he was good, man. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1696.0s)]
*  He was excellent. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1697.0s)]
*  And I think it's important to make fun of both sides. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1698.0s)]
*  And that's, I, it makes me sad to see people get mad [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1701.0s)]
*  at Jon Stewart right now for shitting on both sides. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1705.0s)]
*  I think it's, he's a comedian first, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1709.0s)]
*  and I think it's cool to, when you go to the clubs, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1711.0s)]
*  they don't know exactly what you're gonna say. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1714.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you're gonna have Jon Stewart back on The Daily Show [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1716.0s)]
*  and Biden is making up words, he's gonna bring it up. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1719.0s)]
*  He's not gonna just only fucking simp for the Democrats. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1723.0s)]
*  He's gonna say some funny shit [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1729.0s)]
*  about anything that happens to Democrats, too. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1731.0s)]
*  It's funny. It's part of what the show used to be. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1733.0s)]
*  It's weird that there's a, like, a social responsibility [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1735.0s)]
*  people attribute to comedians when it's like, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1738.0s)]
*  most of us got good at this by cursing at strangers in a bar. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1740.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we all have our political opinions, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1744.0s)]
*  which is fine, but it's like, what Jon's capable of [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1746.0s)]
*  is delivering the news in a very funny way. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1750.0s)]
*  He's the best at it. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1753.0s)]
*  He's the best at that role of being, like, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1755.0s)]
*  the guy that's doing the satire of the news, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1758.0s)]
*  you know, just breaking down everything that's wrong [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1761.0s)]
*  and fucking stupid in the world. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1764.0s)]
*  He is the peak, and it's interesting [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1766.0s)]
*  because he is like the Animal House. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1768.0s)]
*  He's like National Lampoon's Animal House of, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1770.0s)]
*  he's like the bar, and then a lot, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1772.0s)]
*  then everyone tries to copy Animal House, right? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1774.0s)]
*  Right. Porkies. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1776.0s)]
*  Porkies. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1778.0s)]
*  Porkies. Van Wilder II, The Rise of Taj. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1779.0s)]
*  You're like, all right, this isn't as good. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1783.0s)]
*  Stewart, like, if you actually look at his stand-up, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1785.0s)]
*  it's like any form of entertainment. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1788.0s)]
*  To break these rules, you have to know the rules, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1791.0s)]
*  and Stewart is a great stand-up. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1793.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a very funny guy. He's very smart guy. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1795.0s)]
*  He had jokes I remember. I remember he had a joke [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1797.0s)]
*  back in the day where it was about, like, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1799.0s)]
*  how Jews and black people are similar, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1801.0s)]
*  because, you know, Jews, you know, black people, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1803.0s)]
*  we have the blues, and Jews, we just complain all the time. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1805.0s)]
*  I just never thought to put it to music, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1807.0s)]
*  and I'm like, that's the type of observation [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1809.0s)]
*  that's, like, unifying. That's like bringing a room together. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1811.0s)]
*  Yes. I love that. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1813.0s)]
*  That's a very funny bit, too. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1815.0s)]
*  Yeah, he had a great special in the 90s called Unleavened. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1817.0s)]
*  I remember it. It was on Comedy Central all the time. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1820.0s)]
*  Yeah, so he's back, like, on The Daily Show sometimes. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1823.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? Mondays. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1826.0s)]
*  Mondays. He was like, I'll give you one day. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1828.0s)]
*  That's a good move for him. Yeah. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1830.0s)]
*  Yeah, why do it? I guess he had a deal with Apple, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1832.0s)]
*  and I don't know if they're saying the specifics [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1835.0s)]
*  of why they canceled the show, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1840.0s)]
*  but it was something akin to they didn't want him [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1843.0s)]
*  to say anything that would get them in trouble. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1847.0s)]
*  Something along those lines. I forget what his quote was. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1849.0s)]
*  I don't think maybe about China, and they're like, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1851.0s)]
*  hey, we make a lot of shit over there. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1853.0s)]
*  Here it is. Yeah. Here it is. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1855.0s)]
*  John Stewart says Apple TV canceled his show [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1857.0s)]
*  because they didn't want me to say things [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1860.0s)]
*  that might get me in trouble. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1862.0s)]
*  Okay. Damn. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1865.0s)]
*  Boy, kids, what kind of a world are we talking about? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1869.0s)]
*  And by the way, that's like what comics... [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1872.0s)]
*  That's what gets us excited, the idea that this could get me in trouble. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1876.0s)]
*  Like, that's everything. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1879.0s)]
*  Also, Apple, by the way, you distribute all the apps [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1881.0s)]
*  that do all the trouble that's getting everybody in trouble. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1886.0s)]
*  You take a percentage of their profits. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1890.0s)]
*  In this place, you don't want John Stewart to say something [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1892.0s)]
*  that might get him in trouble. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1894.0s)]
*  Why don't you let him decide for himself? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1896.0s)]
*  What's great about John Stewart, too, is there's so many comics [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1898.0s)]
*  who are like, and I have no issue with this, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1900.0s)]
*  but speak recklessly. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1902.0s)]
*  And John is so careful with his words [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1904.0s)]
*  and so skilled at it. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1907.0s)]
*  Yeah. I wanted a place to unload thoughts [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1910.0s)]
*  as we get into this election season, Stewart said. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1914.0s)]
*  I thought I was going to do it over at, they call it, Apple TV+. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1917.0s)]
*  It's a television enclave, very small, it's like living in Malibu. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1921.0s)]
*  But they decided, they felt that they didn't want me to say things [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1925.0s)]
*  that might get me in trouble. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1928.0s)]
*  Okay. I don't know what that means. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1931.0s)]
*  You know, that could mean a lot of things. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1933.0s)]
*  Very coded. I think it's talking about, you know, China maybe. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1935.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think there was a China. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1939.0s)]
*  Stuff like that. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1941.0s)]
*  There's something about that that Apple did, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1942.0s)]
*  like Apple obviously works with China. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1944.0s)]
*  What was the subject? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1946.0s)]
*  It says China. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1948.0s)]
*  AI and China. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1949.0s)]
*  Okay. Times reported that the duo had disagreements [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1950.0s)]
*  over topics that were to be covered in the third season, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1953.0s)]
*  including AI and China. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1956.0s)]
*  Wow, they had a disagreement about AI and China. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1959.0s)]
*  These people, what are they doing? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1962.0s)]
*  Members of the U.S. House of Representatives later questions [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1964.0s)]
*  Apple CEO Tim Cook about whether the tech giant's decision [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1967.0s)]
*  to cancel Stewart's show was because the host may have been planning [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1971.0s)]
*  an upcoming episode about China. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1974.0s)]
*  He says, while companies have the right to determine what content [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1978.0s)]
*  is appropriate for their streaming service, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1981.0s)]
*  the coercive tactics of a foreign power should not be directly [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1983.0s)]
*  or indirectly influencing those determinations. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1987.0s)]
*  The leaders of the House of Representatives select committee [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1990.0s)]
*  on competition with the Chinese Communist Party [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1993.0s)]
*  wrote in a letter to Cook. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1996.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1998.0s)]
*  While Stewart did not mention the rumors about Apple's alleged worry [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=1999.0s)]
*  over an episode about China, he did say the tech giant [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2003.0s)]
*  did want me to say things that might, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2006.0s)]
*  did not want, didn't want me to say things that might get me in trouble. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2009.0s)]
*  As for his daily show return, he said he hopes to provide [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2013.0s)]
*  a catharsis to viewers this election season [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2016.0s)]
*  and a way to comment on things and a way to express them [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2019.0s)]
*  that hopefully people will enjoy. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2023.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2025.0s)]
*  Wow. So far. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2026.0s)]
*  That sounds like China said don't fucking put that shit on. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2028.0s)]
*  That's what I got out of that. What did you get out of that, Sam? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2031.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. It's like that Seth Rogen movie. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2034.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2037.0s)]
*  About North Korea, yeah. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2038.0s)]
*  Is that one that's still available? Can you get that? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2039.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2041.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2042.0s)]
*  Remember when there was tension, like, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2043.0s)]
*  are we going to get nuked over a Seth Rogen movie? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2044.0s)]
*  I remember watching that going, like, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2046.0s)]
*  do you know how dangerous those people are? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2048.0s)]
*  Do you know, you want North Koreans mad at you for hee-hees and ha-has? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2051.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2055.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2056.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2057.0s)]
*  Oof. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2058.0s)]
*  And then they hacked the servers, right? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2059.0s)]
*  Is that what happened? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2061.0s)]
*  They hacked the servers. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2062.0s)]
*  Was that Sony, right? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2063.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then a bunch of shit got found out. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2064.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2066.0s)]
*  And emails and... [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2067.0s)]
*  Was that definitely them? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2068.0s)]
*  That's what I was trying to remember. I thought so. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2069.0s)]
*  That could just be cyber criminals. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2071.0s)]
*  I think it was, yeah, it might have been a coincidence. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2073.0s)]
*  It could be cyber criminals that decided to attack based on that. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2076.0s)]
*  Oh, no. No, no. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2080.0s)]
*  No? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2081.0s)]
*  According to the Wiki, it says... [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2082.0s)]
*  Can I just dream? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2083.0s)]
*  Can a boy dream? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2084.0s)]
*  It was then? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2085.0s)]
*  The Guardians of the Peace, a cyber crime group [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2086.0s)]
*  allegedly connected to the North Korean government. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2088.0s)]
*  Oh, it is connected, huh? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2090.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2091.0s)]
*  Guardians of Peace, what a great name. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2092.0s)]
*  That sounds like a government bill. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2094.0s)]
*  It is? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2096.0s)]
*  Guardians of Peace sounds like a new bill [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2098.0s)]
*  that would push for the House. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2100.0s)]
*  Man, some of the Senate... [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2103.0s)]
*  Remember when the Senate did... [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2104.0s)]
*  They did a hearing on... [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2105.0s)]
*  It was like during Katrina. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2107.0s)]
*  I think they did like one day on Katrina [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2108.0s)]
*  and nine days on steroids and baseball. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2110.0s)]
*  Because they just wanted... [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2113.0s)]
*  Because you just want to meet Rafael Palmeiro. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2114.0s)]
*  Remember? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2116.0s)]
*  They're like, oh, we're big fans. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2117.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. That's hilarious. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2119.0s)]
*  I mean, the shit that they get concerned with is so crazy. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2121.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you don't want to go full communist. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2125.0s)]
*  You don't want to say like, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2127.0s)]
*  the news shouldn't be able to make money. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2128.0s)]
*  You know? They should be able to make money. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2131.0s)]
*  They should be able to make money, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2133.0s)]
*  but the second you combine news and entertainment, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2134.0s)]
*  it's a dangerous, mucky area. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2136.0s)]
*  It gets real squirrely. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2137.0s)]
*  It gets real squirrely. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2138.0s)]
*  Because entertainment is not news. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2139.0s)]
*  It's not news at all. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2142.0s)]
*  The news is supposed to be boring. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2143.0s)]
*  Boring as shit. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2144.0s)]
*  You're supposed to be like, why am I... [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2145.0s)]
*  And now we have it in a way where like, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2147.0s)]
*  you watch 12 straight out of the news. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2148.0s)]
*  That's a fucking problem. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2150.0s)]
*  Well, what's my favorite is the in-between story banter. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2151.0s)]
*  That is the most uncomfortable, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2156.0s)]
*  hurried, kind of weird fake talk [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2158.0s)]
*  that exists in all of television. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2162.0s)]
*  It doesn't exist anywhere else on Earth right now [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2163.0s)]
*  in mainstream entertainment. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2166.0s)]
*  Then the banter between the anchor [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2169.0s)]
*  and like the weather lady [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2172.0s)]
*  as they're throwing back and forth to each other. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2173.0s)]
*  Then this guy. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2176.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2177.0s)]
*  It is the fakest. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2178.0s)]
*  Well, that seems like, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2179.0s)]
*  I don't know what to say about that. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2181.0s)]
*  I still do morning news just to ruin the segments. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2183.0s)]
*  That's the only reason I go on. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2185.0s)]
*  I do it all the time. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2187.0s)]
*  You did a good one in Columbus. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2188.0s)]
*  Did you see that one? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2189.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's from Frontside. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2190.0s)]
*  That was one. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2191.0s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2192.0s)]
*  I can send it to you. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2193.0s)]
*  It's pretty funny. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2194.0s)]
*  I'll find it. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2195.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I have it here. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2196.0s)]
*  It's probably on my Instagram or something. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2197.0s)]
*  It's a... [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2200.0s)]
*  I just kept making up that they had a human trafficking problem [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2201.0s)]
*  in Columbus. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2204.0s)]
*  And the guy lost it on me. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2205.0s)]
*  Because I'll only do those news segments if they're live [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2206.0s)]
*  because there's no point in doing a tape one. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2209.0s)]
*  They'll just edit out whatever horrible thing I do. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2211.0s)]
*  But sometimes you get someone really cool [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2213.0s)]
*  and you'll just riff with them and be silly. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2215.0s)]
*  But this dude I could tell, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2217.0s)]
*  I'll throw like a jab to see if it bothers them. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2219.0s)]
*  And if I can sense it bothers them, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2222.0s)]
*  I'll go like a hundred miles an hour [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2223.0s)]
*  and just derail the segment. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2225.0s)]
*  I got... [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2227.0s)]
*  I remember I have a publicist, Pam, who hates me. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2228.0s)]
*  I don't care about morning radio. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2231.0s)]
*  Just book me on morning shows. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2233.0s)]
*  And she's like, they're on to you. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2234.0s)]
*  They know you're going to ruin the segment. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2235.0s)]
*  But Pam, she gets so mad at me. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2237.0s)]
*  Do you ever go on one and the people are cool [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2240.0s)]
*  and you don't ruin the segment? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2242.0s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2243.0s)]
*  But they usually end up... [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2244.0s)]
*  Sometimes they think it's funny. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2246.0s)]
*  But other times... [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2247.0s)]
*  See, I did one... [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2248.0s)]
*  We were on a tour bus last year [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2249.0s)]
*  and I pretended my opener, Gary Veeder, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2251.0s)]
*  overdosed on cocaine on the bus. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2253.0s)]
*  And they were so mad at me. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2255.0s)]
*  And she called me like, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2257.0s)]
*  you're banned from Good Morning Durham. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2259.0s)]
*  And I was like, I'll live. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2261.0s)]
*  But... [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2264.0s)]
*  But we've done a lot where I just... [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2266.0s)]
*  I poke and I see what I can get away with. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2268.0s)]
*  How many people are watching those shows? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2271.0s)]
*  Not a lot. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2273.0s)]
*  But when I share them, they do pretty well [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2274.0s)]
*  because they're weird to watch me do something bad. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2275.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2280.0s)]
*  I can text it to you. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2281.0s)]
*  I think I have it on my phone somewhere. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2282.0s)]
*  I'm trying to find it. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2284.0s)]
*  No people under 60 are watching that, right? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2285.0s)]
*  Am I correct? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2288.0s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2289.0s)]
*  I mean, sometimes when I'm in a hotel, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2290.0s)]
*  I have it on in the background just for background noise [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2291.0s)]
*  when I'm bored on the road. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2293.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2294.0s)]
*  But yeah, I don't... [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2295.0s)]
*  It's almost like I want to watch the news, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2297.0s)]
*  but I don't want to think. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2300.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2301.0s)]
*  Which, you know... [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2302.0s)]
*  I'm not going to watch BBC. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2304.0s)]
*  I'm going to watch Pittsburgh Today Live. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2305.0s)]
*  Local men eaten by alligator. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2308.0s)]
*  That was the first one. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2314.0s)]
*  Pittsburgh, actually. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2315.0s)]
*  I pretended I was molested on air. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2316.0s)]
*  Because she just kept asking the dumbest questions, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2318.0s)]
*  and she goes, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2320.0s)]
*  when did you catch the funny bug? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2321.0s)]
*  And I said, well, my uncle molested me, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2323.0s)]
*  and he was funny, and I called it Spider-Man. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2325.0s)]
*  And they just stared at me like, oh, is it? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2328.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2331.0s)]
*  No, that's Springfield. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2332.0s)]
*  I know him all. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2334.0s)]
*  That's a guy. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2335.0s)]
*  You just did this joke on Instagram [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2336.0s)]
*  less than 24 hours ago. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2337.0s)]
*  Talk about what people can expect. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2338.0s)]
*  I mean, have you been to Columbus before, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2340.0s)]
*  or is this the first time for you? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2342.0s)]
*  Oh, I've been. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2343.0s)]
*  I've been. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2344.0s)]
*  I love Columbus. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2345.0s)]
*  Great city. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2346.0s)]
*  Great city. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2347.0s)]
*  Big fan of, despite all the human trafficking going on there, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2348.0s)]
*  I still find a lot of fun. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2353.0s)]
*  Great city, nonetheless. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2355.0s)]
*  You've got your class. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2357.0s)]
*  I can tell he doesn't want it, so this is where I poke. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2358.0s)]
*  This Friday, October 27th, tell us what we can expect with that. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2361.0s)]
*  I'm going to talk about the human trafficking epidemic [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2365.0s)]
*  in Columbus, Ohio. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2367.0s)]
*  What is going on with the human trafficking you're talking about? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2368.0s)]
*  Are you a big sports fan? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2372.0s)]
*  What's going on with that? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2374.0s)]
*  I'll tell you what I'm not a fan of is human trafficking. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2376.0s)]
*  I don't know where you're going with that. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2379.0s)]
*  There are a lot of news reports. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2381.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2382.0s)]
*  All right, well, listen, Sam, enjoy yourself. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2383.0s)]
*  This is the best part, because he snaps here. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2384.0s)]
*  We'll look forward to seeing you. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2387.0s)]
*  Thanks, Sam. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2388.0s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2389.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2390.0s)]
*  All right, have a good one. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2391.0s)]
*  I don't get, I don't know, I think he would, you know, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2392.0s)]
*  I know he's kind of edgy and funny. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2394.0s)]
*  I didn't get the human trafficking thing, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2395.0s)]
*  because it really wasn't funny the first time, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2397.0s)]
*  and then he kept doing it two and three and four times. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2399.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2401.0s)]
*  And I tried to ask him, you saw him try to ask you, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2402.0s)]
*  is this a joke? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2404.0s)]
*  Are you trying to be funny? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2405.0s)]
*  What are you trying to do? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2406.0s)]
*  And it just didn't work. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2407.0s)]
*  Well, I was just trying to explain. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2408.0s)]
*  The audience just saw the same thing, too. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2409.0s)]
*  OK, we'll go to break. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2411.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2413.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was it. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2414.0s)]
*  He really lost it. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2415.0s)]
*  That's the only way they're worth doing to me, though, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2417.0s)]
*  is if it's like insanely uncomfortable. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2419.0s)]
*  It makes you think, like, even just the way you do one of those shows, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2422.0s)]
*  like, those people aren't real friends, you know? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2428.0s)]
*  Like, you're trying to make them fake. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2430.0s)]
*  Some of them are good. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2432.0s)]
*  Well, Good Morning America, those two that were fucking, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2433.0s)]
*  they were real friends. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2435.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were great. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2436.0s)]
*  And they were great at their job. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2437.0s)]
*  That's why they were good together. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2438.0s)]
*  They shouldn't have been fired. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2439.0s)]
*  Why were they fired? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2440.0s)]
*  For fucking. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2441.0s)]
*  Well, here's what happened. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2442.0s)]
*  She just fucked him. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2443.0s)]
*  He was fucking everybody there, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2444.0s)]
*  so I think they were like, well, if we fire him. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2445.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, we got it. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2447.0s)]
*  But they were good. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2450.0s)]
*  I did their show once, and I didn't... [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2452.0s)]
*  It was just a regular interview, because they were fun. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2453.0s)]
*  Well, they should do a podcast together. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2455.0s)]
*  I think they are. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2457.0s)]
*  Are they doing a podcast? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2458.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2459.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2460.0s)]
*  You don't want a boss. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2461.0s)]
*  Especially in those kind of environments. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2462.0s)]
*  It's just too restrictive. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2464.0s)]
*  And it makes me think, if you look at that guy, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2465.0s)]
*  no offense to that guy that you were just talking to, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2467.0s)]
*  but I couldn't imagine some sort of an audition process [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2470.0s)]
*  that yielded such results. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2473.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2475.0s)]
*  Like, this is the best you guys have. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2476.0s)]
*  It's a big city, Columbus. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2478.0s)]
*  Tell the news. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2479.0s)]
*  Big city with a lot of human trafficking. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2480.0s)]
*  It's... [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2482.0s)]
*  She almost backed you up on that. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2483.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2485.0s)]
*  She did. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2486.0s)]
*  She's like, there's a lot of reports. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2487.0s)]
*  There's a lot of reports. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2488.0s)]
*  I don't think it's a funny rumor to make up, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2490.0s)]
*  to be like, you have a human trafficking problem. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2492.0s)]
*  And I had no research to back that up, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2494.0s)]
*  but it's... clearly, if you have Columbus' pride, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2496.0s)]
*  it bothers you. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2498.0s)]
*  There are stories. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2499.0s)]
*  There are stories. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2500.0s)]
*  There's also, you're doing it on Zoom, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2501.0s)]
*  which is extra frustrating, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2503.0s)]
*  because, like, you're not even in the room, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2504.0s)]
*  so they can't even go, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2506.0s)]
*  Like, you know? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2508.0s)]
*  You're so disconnected, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2509.0s)]
*  they have to be very obvious when they're talking to you. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2511.0s)]
*  But I've done it where I was bad, and it wasn't live, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2514.0s)]
*  and they just edited it out. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2516.0s)]
*  I'm like, god damn it, you know? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2517.0s)]
*  Gotta get the live ones. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2519.0s)]
*  But it's hard to ask for live, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2520.0s)]
*  or say no, you're gonna do something. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2522.0s)]
*  So you see my predicament. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2523.0s)]
*  I'm like, I want live. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2524.0s)]
*  And they're like, what's he gonna do? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2525.0s)]
*  Well, I think the gig is up. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2527.0s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2528.0s)]
*  I got one coming up. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2529.0s)]
*  We'll see if they unbook me. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2531.0s)]
*  Maybe they'll be prepared, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2533.0s)]
*  and they'll just let you fuck with them. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2535.0s)]
*  They have done that before, and they were... [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2536.0s)]
*  You know, I did one pre-recorded for New York One. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2538.0s)]
*  When I was promoting MSG Theater, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2541.0s)]
*  I did that one, and they were mad I didn't do it. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2543.0s)]
*  But it was pre-recorded, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2546.0s)]
*  and they were like, yeah, he just... [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2548.0s)]
*  They told my friend, they were like, yeah, he just behaved. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2549.0s)]
*  It was really a bummer. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2551.0s)]
*  And I was like, well, now I gotta be bad. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2552.0s)]
*  Because you knew it was pre-recorded? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2554.0s)]
*  So you're like, ah. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2556.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was just kind of out of energy. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2557.0s)]
*  I was like, what's the point? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2559.0s)]
*  Deflated. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2560.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2561.0s)]
*  They're playing dirty. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2562.0s)]
*  Pre-recorded with you is playing dirty. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2563.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2565.0s)]
*  I'm playing dirty too, though. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2566.0s)]
*  You are, but that's the game we play. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2567.0s)]
*  That's the game we play. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2569.0s)]
*  It's just fun. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2571.0s)]
*  If you want to do a morning show. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2572.0s)]
*  When Sigour used to do DJ Dadmaps. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2573.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2575.0s)]
*  TJ Miller was another one who would do crazy shit on there, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2577.0s)]
*  and I was like, I love that. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2579.0s)]
*  Sigour was the king of it. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2581.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2582.0s)]
*  He came out as non-binary on a morning show. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2583.0s)]
*  Just fucking total deadpan with a gold chain on and sunglasses. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2590.0s)]
*  His energy's perfect for it too. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2595.0s)]
*  He's got that calming energy too. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2597.0s)]
*  And just the name DJ Dadmouth, like what the fuck. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2599.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that's so funny. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2603.0s)]
*  That's so fucking stupid. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2607.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2609.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2610.0s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2611.0s)]
*  You kind of killed a lot of those types of shows with your show, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2612.0s)]
*  because it's like, would you rather see them on Good Morning Whatever [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2616.0s)]
*  for four minutes or on your show for three hours? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2621.0s)]
*  They'd rather see this. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2625.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's also, it's just those, that format sucks. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2627.0s)]
*  It's a bad format. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2631.0s)]
*  It sucks. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2632.0s)]
*  I still like the idea of a live interview. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2633.0s)]
*  I think that's really fun. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2635.0s)]
*  Live interviews are fun. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2636.0s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, you doing three hours is like, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2638.0s)]
*  it would change that, I think. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2643.0s)]
*  I was just lazy. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2646.0s)]
*  I didn't want to edit anything. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2648.0s)]
*  Ari used to tell me, he goes, you've got to edit your show. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2649.0s)]
*  That was his number one complaint. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2653.0s)]
*  Telling you, listen to me, you've got to edit your show. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2655.0s)]
*  And I was like, why? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2657.0s)]
*  No one's going to listen to all that. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2659.0s)]
*  Then they don't have to listen. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2660.0s)]
*  I was like, then don't listen. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2661.0s)]
*  I don't care if you stop halfway in. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2663.0s)]
*  Listen to as much as you want. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2665.0s)]
*  Well, you went against what a lot of people say [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2666.0s)]
*  is about the entertainment. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2669.0s)]
*  We'll keep them wanting more. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2670.0s)]
*  You're just like, nope, this is the show. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2672.0s)]
*  It's also this idea that everybody has a short attention span. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2674.0s)]
*  That's just not true. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2677.0s)]
*  That's horse shit. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2678.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2679.0s)]
*  People, even people with short attention spans, get into things. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2680.0s)]
*  There might be some subject that someone's talking about [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2684.0s)]
*  that lights your interest, lights your curiosity, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2687.0s)]
*  and then you get locked into it. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2691.0s)]
*  Where you would never spend three hours ordinarily [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2693.0s)]
*  listening to some guy talk about Egypt, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2696.0s)]
*  some Graham Hancock type character talking about [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2698.0s)]
*  the people that constructed these things in Turkey and Chile. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2703.0s)]
*  You would never do that in the normal world. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2707.0s)]
*  But you could get locked into a conversation, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2710.0s)]
*  and if it's a three hour conversation, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2715.0s)]
*  you come out of that much more energized [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2719.0s)]
*  with whatever that subject is. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2722.0s)]
*  Not only is that true, but also I think the fact that people [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2724.0s)]
*  can listen to stuff while they're cleaning the house and stuff. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2727.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2729.0s)]
*  You can't do that with a movie. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2730.0s)]
*  The thing is, the number one attractor is always going to be [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2732.0s)]
*  the TikTok and the Instagram Reels. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2736.0s)]
*  Those are the ones that they suck you in. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2739.0s)]
*  They work with the human mind. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2741.0s)]
*  It drives me crazy. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2743.0s)]
*  Do you get addicted to it? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2744.0s)]
*  They're so effective. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2745.0s)]
*  Instagram Reels are so effective. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2746.0s)]
*  The food ones for me fucking ruin my day. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2748.0s)]
*  Oh, those are good. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2750.0s)]
*  It's just some fucking asshole in his car eating a sandwich. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2751.0s)]
*  I'm just watching a dude eat a sandwich. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2754.0s)]
*  You bring it down, you're like, this is so sad. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2756.0s)]
*  Sexy. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2758.0s)]
*  It is sexy. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2759.0s)]
*  And he rates the sandwich, I'm like, good enough for me. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2760.0s)]
*  And then they send me 40 more. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2762.0s)]
*  Everyone's a food critic now. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2764.0s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2765.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2766.0s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2767.0s)]
*  People will find their way. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2768.0s)]
*  They find their way. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2769.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's just the addictive nature of scrolling. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2770.0s)]
*  I'm more mad at myself, honestly. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2773.0s)]
*  I'm more mad that that's my for you page. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2775.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2777.0s)]
*  It's mostly food. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2778.0s)]
*  Well, I don't think you have to worry. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2780.0s)]
*  Someone slicing a tomahawk steak, someone eating a sandwich. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2782.0s)]
*  Those are good things. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2785.0s)]
*  I love them. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2786.0s)]
*  Yeah, those are good things. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2787.0s)]
*  I find a lot, Gary Veeder tours with me and he just sends me food. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2788.0s)]
*  Whenever we're on the road, he's like, we're eating here. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2790.0s)]
*  He's more high maintenance than any woman I've ever dated. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2792.0s)]
*  He's like, you're taking me here. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2794.0s)]
*  It's five stars. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2795.0s)]
*  You better fucking pay up, bitch. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2796.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2799.0s)]
*  That is a nice thing if you go to good cities, right? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2800.0s)]
*  You can always get nice restaurants on the road. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2802.0s)]
*  Every city's got a nice restaurant now. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2804.0s)]
*  I mean, people don't fuck around in the Netherlands in between realms. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2806.0s)]
*  If you don't go too far. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2811.0s)]
*  It's weird, though, what cities now like every city has this crazy food culture now. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2814.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2820.0s)]
*  No matter where you are. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2821.0s)]
*  I think the Internet is partly to blame for that, too. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2822.0s)]
*  There's so many YouTube sort of like mini documentaries on chefs and mini [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2825.0s)]
*  documentaries on restaurants that they're opening. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2830.0s)]
*  There's 9000 episodes of Chopped. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2833.0s)]
*  Think about how many chefs there are. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2835.0s)]
*  What, four chefs per episode? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2837.0s)]
*  You got to give credit to TV, right? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2839.0s)]
*  Like the Travel Channel and stuff like that, because those are the first people that [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2841.0s)]
*  put cooking out there like an art form. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2845.0s)]
*  Like with Bourdain's show, that was the first time I ever considered cooking. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2849.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, it's an art form. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2853.0s)]
*  You just eat it. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2855.0s)]
*  I thought of it as just cooking as like carpentry or something like that. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2856.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2860.0s)]
*  And I related to it as a comic, just a guy like wandering and being like, oh, let me [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2861.0s)]
*  make the most of Kalamazoo, Michigan. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2865.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2867.0s)]
*  Like instead of eating this vending machine, let me try to find a cool diner or something. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2868.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2871.0s)]
*  So those are some of the most satisfying places. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2873.0s)]
*  You find like a cool old place. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2875.0s)]
*  Been around forever. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2877.0s)]
*  You get like steak and eggs there. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2878.0s)]
*  Nothing gets my dick hard like a boxcar diner, dude. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2879.0s)]
*  I get so excited. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2882.0s)]
*  We went found one in Buffalo and we ate there. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2883.0s)]
*  We find a good spot. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2885.0s)]
*  We eat there three days in a row. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2886.0s)]
*  I'm obsessed with like just a cool diner. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2888.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2891.0s)]
*  There was a place called the Star Diner that I used to eat in. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2892.0s)]
*  I think it was in Mount Vernon, New York. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2895.0s)]
*  It was so sketchy, this neighborhood. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2897.0s)]
*  It was so sketchy, but they had cheeseburger deluxes and the cheeseburger deluxe had like [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2900.0s)]
*  coleslaw on it. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2906.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was ridiculous. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2907.0s)]
*  Coleslaw is underrated on a sandwich. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2909.0s)]
*  A Reuben is an underrated sandwich. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2911.0s)]
*  It's 2 30 in the morning. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2913.0s)]
*  You're hanging out with men who have just failed miserably and everyone's eating these [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2914.0s)]
*  disgusting cheeseburgers at 2 o'clock in the morning. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2921.0s)]
*  There's something so... [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2925.0s)]
*  It's such a vibe. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2926.0s)]
*  That's like a late night waffle house anytime. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2927.0s)]
*  There's something... [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2929.0s)]
*  That's a New York vibe too, like those kind of diners. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2930.0s)]
*  There's something so... [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2933.0s)]
*  There's something about like when you're on the road and you're in a sad place, that's [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2934.0s)]
*  like weirdly romantic to me too. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2938.0s)]
*  Gary and I stayed at a residence inn in Omaha and it was just U-Haul truck after U-Haul [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2940.0s)]
*  truck of just shit in the parking lot. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2944.0s)]
*  I'm like, it's us and 40 divorced men here. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2946.0s)]
*  There's something so sad about this. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2948.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2951.0s)]
*  Get out. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2952.0s)]
*  Yeah, I love a late night diner. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2954.0s)]
*  What's your diner order when you go? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2956.0s)]
*  Well, it depends on if I'm drunk. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2958.0s)]
*  If I'm drunk, I might go off the rails. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2962.0s)]
*  But most of the time, I'm pretty disciplined. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2966.0s)]
*  Most of the time, I'm just eating whatever healthy options they have, like meat or eggs [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2968.0s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2972.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2973.0s)]
*  Most of the time. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2974.0s)]
*  Eggs is the obvious move, but a tuna melt at a diner can be so clutch. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2975.0s)]
*  Oh, those are so nice. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2980.0s)]
*  Such a nice invention. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2982.0s)]
*  How about a tuna patty melt? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2983.0s)]
*  Yeah, or like a souvlaki. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2985.0s)]
*  Oh, souvlaki. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2987.0s)]
*  Love a souvlaki. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2988.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2989.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2990.0s)]
*  A gyro, dude, a late night gyro. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2991.0s)]
*  Look at you pronouncing it correctly. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2993.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know a lot of Greek people. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2994.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't pronounce it correctly. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2997.0s)]
*  I know how to pronounce it, but I just forget. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=2999.0s)]
*  If it's done the right way with the best bread. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3001.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3004.0s)]
*  Yeah, like toasted pita. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3005.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, bro. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3006.0s)]
*  Come on with it. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3007.0s)]
*  If I had to choose, though, one option for late night, if something's open that's legit, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3009.0s)]
*  it would be between Mexican and Italian. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3018.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3020.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3021.0s)]
*  If someone tells you there's a place that serves insane lasagna at two in the morning, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3022.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3028.0s)]
*  We have to go. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3030.0s)]
*  For me, it's pizza all day. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3032.0s)]
*  It's like late night pizza's just so, it's so, I mean. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3033.0s)]
*  Especially good pizza. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3036.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3037.0s)]
*  Real good New York pizza. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3038.0s)]
*  You get a good slice, just a regular cheese and tomato sauce slice. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3039.0s)]
*  When it's just perfectly seasoned and it's melting in your mouth, the cheese, you're [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3046.0s)]
*  like, oh my god, this is so good. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3051.0s)]
*  I watched so much of that guy just randomly, Portnoy on Barstool doing those reviews. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3053.0s)]
*  Oh, he's the best. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3057.0s)]
*  I just like, I say how much I hate watching these food things, but I fucking can't. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3058.0s)]
*  I just like the, I like how he likes all the same types. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3061.0s)]
*  I like like that flop. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3064.0s)]
*  The New Haven pizza's my favorite pizza. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3066.0s)]
*  It's the best pizza in the world, apparently. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3068.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3070.0s)]
*  According to Portnoy. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3071.0s)]
*  He knows more than, I told him, I said, did you get 10% of all the profits for pizza? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3072.0s)]
*  I bet if you had like a pizza chart between when Portnoy started doing those reviews to [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3076.0s)]
*  how many people are going and buying pizza now, I bet it's not a small number. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3083.0s)]
*  I bet he's impacted the pizza world significantly. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3087.0s)]
*  I'm not bullshitting. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3090.0s)]
*  He makes me want to buy pizza. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3091.0s)]
*  Yeah, you watch it. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3093.0s)]
*  He bites the crust too. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3094.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm like, oh, he looks like he's having a good time. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3095.0s)]
*  We did, when I was in Chicago with Mateo Lane, he was in Chicago with you the one night [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3099.0s)]
*  to the next night. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3104.0s)]
*  And then early we hung out. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3105.0s)]
*  We made pizza at Lou Monotti's Deep Dish. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3106.0s)]
*  And they let us in there to just make pizza. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3108.0s)]
*  And then I was like, all right, now I don't like Chicago pizza that much. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3110.0s)]
*  It's like, it tastes good. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3113.0s)]
*  It's just not my style pizza. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3115.0s)]
*  It's like, it's not, it's a pie. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3116.0s)]
*  It's not pizza. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3119.0s)]
*  So I was like, all right, we'll see if Arturo's in the village. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3120.0s)]
*  This place is Colin Quinn's stamp of approval, which to me, like he's the most New York guy [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3124.0s)]
*  I've ever met. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3129.0s)]
*  So if Colin Quinn likes your pizza, you're legit. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3130.0s)]
*  And we made the pizza Arturo's on Houston, one of the best pizza spots. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3132.0s)]
*  Also the vibe, there's a fucking piano player just playing in there. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3137.0s)]
*  It's like, it's so New York, dude. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3140.0s)]
*  Yeah, those places are fantastic. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3142.0s)]
*  I love them. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3144.0s)]
*  And they make good everything. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3145.0s)]
*  If you could find a good old Italian hole in the wall spot in New York, like that's one of the cool things about like Mulberry Street. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3147.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3156.0s)]
*  You know, those places, there's some places down there that have been around forever. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3157.0s)]
*  Yeah, you'll just Google it and you'll be like, 1909. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3162.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3165.0s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3166.0s)]
*  Do you ever talk to Fitzsimmons about when he lived there? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3167.0s)]
*  Not about that, but yeah, I know Greg. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3169.0s)]
*  I love Greg. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3172.0s)]
*  Fitzsimmons lived right above the social club where John Gotti used to go. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3173.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3177.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3178.0s)]
*  How about that John Gotti, man? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3179.0s)]
*  Fitzsimmons used to live right, I went to his fucking apartment. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3181.0s)]
*  I mean, he was the reason Sparks is popular. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3186.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3189.0s)]
*  Like, you feel like cool walking in and you're like, this is where the guy got shot. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3190.0s)]
*  Right there. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3194.0s)]
*  This is what happened. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3195.0s)]
*  It's a good restaurant though, too. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3196.0s)]
*  Fitzsimmons lived right there. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3198.0s)]
*  That's the amount of danger we all like, is just to know someone was shot here and they're not going to do it again. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3199.0s)]
*  What are the odds another guy gets whacked here, right? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3204.0s)]
*  They don't whack each other that often. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3207.0s)]
*  What year did Gotti get arrested? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3209.0s)]
*  He got arrested so many times. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3215.0s)]
*  Was it in the 90s? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3216.0s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out when Fitzsimmons was there. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3217.0s)]
*  Was he there while the social club was in operation? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3219.0s)]
*  I know the whole family that owned the building was all like, go meet some dudes. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3224.0s)]
*  He had deals where he'd give the mother some money. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3229.0s)]
*  Like, my Frankie doesn't have to know about this. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3233.0s)]
*  This is my gambling money. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3236.0s)]
*  And she would take that money. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3238.0s)]
*  They had little deals. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3239.0s)]
*  He would pay the mother and the father separately. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3241.0s)]
*  December 1990? [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3245.0s)]
*  December 1990. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3247.0s)]
*  Okay, so that must mean he was already in jail by the time Fitzsimmons lived there. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3249.0s)]
*  Because I think Greg and I, we came to New York around the same time. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3255.0s)]
*  And that was like, Greg might have been there first, too. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3260.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3263.0s)]
*  He was like the media darling. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3265.0s)]
*  It's so weird to be a murderer and you're on the cover of the Post with a pun. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3268.0s)]
*  You know, just like, this guy's fun. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3272.0s)]
*  Because he kept getting off, right? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3274.0s)]
*  How many times did he get off? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3276.0s)]
*  Yeah, they called him Teflon Don. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3277.0s)]
*  Teflon Don. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3280.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3282.0s)]
*  Those were weird times. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3283.0s)]
*  You know who the mob boss is and he's wearing a nice suit and he's walking around in front of everybody. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3284.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3289.0s)]
*  It's really weird to be a mob celebrity. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3290.0s)]
*  And then people take, like if he was around now, you'd be like, selfie. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3293.0s)]
*  But you know what it's like? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3296.0s)]
*  It's like you're in a race but your car's not quite strong enough to do that. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3297.0s)]
*  And then the federal government shuts the race down. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3301.0s)]
*  Whereas if you're in Mexico, you can actually do that. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3304.0s)]
*  If you're in Mexico and you're a cartel leader, you are a cartel leader. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3308.0s)]
*  You're the guy. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3312.0s)]
*  Like that's legit. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3313.0s)]
*  No one's putting you in jail. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3314.0s)]
*  But it's weird to be able to do that in New York. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3316.0s)]
*  Yeah, very weird. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3318.0s)]
*  But it was also a different time, right? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3320.0s)]
*  You know, it was a different time. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3322.0s)]
*  We glamorized that shit that we all do. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3324.0s)]
*  Because mob movies are the best movies. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3326.0s)]
*  I mean, like you got Godfather, Goodfellas. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3328.0s)]
*  Sopranos, one of the best shows of all time. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3330.0s)]
*  Probably my number one, honestly. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3332.0s)]
*  God, it's good. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3333.0s)]
*  God damn, it's good. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3334.0s)]
*  I rewatched an episode the other day. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3335.0s)]
*  I'm like, God. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3337.0s)]
*  It might be one of the funniest shows ever, too. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3338.0s)]
*  That's how good it is. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3340.0s)]
*  It's a fucking show. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3341.0s)]
*  There's a line in that show where Meadow's being a spoiled brat. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3342.0s)]
*  And they're like, we're going to ground you. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3346.0s)]
*  You can't do this. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3348.0s)]
*  And she just runs away. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3349.0s)]
*  And Carmella's like, what are they going to do? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3351.0s)]
*  What do we do when we realize that we have no power? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3353.0s)]
*  It's like such an honest, funny line. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3355.0s)]
*  I mean, Tony, fuck. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3357.0s)]
*  And Gandolfini. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3359.0s)]
*  We were like robbed of so many more good Gandolfini projects. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3360.0s)]
*  God, he was good. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3363.0s)]
*  He's the fucking best. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3364.0s)]
*  He was so good. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3365.0s)]
*  He became that guy. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3366.0s)]
*  Like, he did a lot of different characters in different movies. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3368.0s)]
*  He was really good at being a creep. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3371.0s)]
*  Wasn't he in... [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3373.0s)]
*  What was that? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3375.0s)]
*  True Romance? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3377.0s)]
*  True Romance. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3378.0s)]

*  Holy shit. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3380.0s)]
*  That movie holds up, by the way. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3381.0s)]
*  I just watched it again recently. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3382.0s)]
*  It's fucking great. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3383.0s)]
*  Dennis Hopper, dude. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3384.0s)]
*  And Walken. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3385.0s)]
*  That scene is fucking insane. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3386.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3388.0s)]
*  That's some classic Tarantino 90s dialogue right there. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3389.0s)]
*  That's some good shit. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3392.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3393.0s)]
*  True Romance. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3394.0s)]
*  This is one of the more violent scenes I've ever seen in a movie. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3395.0s)]
*  I got this in Las Vegas. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3401.0s)]
*  Nevada. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3403.0s)]
*  Yeah, let's not watch it. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3407.0s)]
*  But dude, he's in like, Get Shorty. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3409.0s)]
*  He's in so many fucking movies. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3411.0s)]
*  But when he became Tony Soprano, he like, was that guy. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3414.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3417.0s)]
*  It's like, to have an actor that good playing a mob boss to the point where you are sympathetic, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3418.0s)]
*  you're rooting for this murderer. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3424.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3426.0s)]
*  You're rooting for Tony Soprano. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3427.0s)]
*  They humanized him. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3429.0s)]
*  I mean, when you show them at like a cookout, you're like, I go to cookouts. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3430.0s)]
*  You know, I do. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3434.0s)]
*  I mean, they made him human. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3435.0s)]
*  And he was just following the rules of his game. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3437.0s)]
*  That's the game that he did. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3440.0s)]
*  And he was the best at it. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3441.0s)]
*  They didn't have high enough horsepower. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3442.0s)]
*  But again, if he was El Chapo, I guess they got him too. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3444.0s)]
*  But we got him. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3449.0s)]
*  And his wife too, right? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3450.0s)]
*  Who got, who, like, who took over? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3451.0s)]
*  Like, that guy doesn't have a name. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3454.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3455.0s)]
*  That's a good move. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3456.0s)]
*  If you're going to be a cartel guy, tell everybody. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3457.0s)]
*  Reservation tonight for the cartel guy. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3460.0s)]
*  You don't know his name. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3462.0s)]
*  You want to be John Doe. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3463.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3464.0s)]
*  You want everybody to shut the fuck up. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3465.0s)]
*  You don't want anybody. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3467.0s)]
*  You're running a cartel, sir. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3468.0s)]
*  But they would remind you that he was a monster every once in a while. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3469.0s)]
*  Like, I mean, he kills his fucking own guy. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3472.0s)]
*  He's a monster. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3474.0s)]
*  Who killed their own guy? [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3475.0s)]

*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3479.0s)]
*  They'd hit you with reminders every once in a while. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3480.0s)]
*  I mean, the show was so fun that they'd have to hit you with, like, the brutal reminders of, you know, Phil Leotardo sodomizing a gay character. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3482.0s)]
*  It's like they'd have to hit you with that because you'd be like, oh, this is funny. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3489.0s)]
*  And then you hit that, you'd be like, Jesus. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3493.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3495.0s)]
*  There was a lot of Jesus moments in that show. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3496.0s)]
*  What's really funny is if you watched the first episode of the show, it was almost like satire. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3498.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3503.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3509.0s)]

*  The car chase thing. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3511.0s)]
*  When she's got the machine gun and like, because she was outside with the machine gun. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3512.0s)]
*  I think she thought her kid was sneaking out of the house or something. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3517.0s)]
*  Was that Carmella? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3519.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3520.0s)]
*  Yes. Right. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3521.0s)]
*  Something happened and she was outside with an AK-47. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3522.0s)]
*  You're like, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3524.0s)]
*  What is this show? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3526.0s)]
*  But she became much more like normal. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3527.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3531.0s)]
*  Like she wasn't like that. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3532.0s)]
*  Like it was almost like they were doing like a network sitcom-y version of mobsters. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3533.0s)]
*  They went. Yeah. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3539.0s)]
*  It was cool to see the show grow. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3540.0s)]
*  But damn, it's like the first season even goes. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3541.0s)]
*  It's like him versus his uncle, uncle Junior. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3544.0s)]

*  That was like, there's so many great shows. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3576.0s)]
*  It's tough to touch. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3578.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, that was really like a golden age in TV. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3579.0s)]
*  The way like the 60s, 70s was a golden age in Hollywood, you know, where like you get like all those fucking old movies of like, you know, Bonnie and Clyde starting this off, The Graduate, Chinatown, Godfather, Taxi Driver, like all these insane apocalypse now, you know? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3583.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3599.0s)]
*  Comedy movies took the biggest hit. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3600.0s)]
*  Recently, man. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3603.0s)]
*  We took the biggest hit. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3604.0s)]
*  Isn't it crazy? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3606.0s)]
*  Everybody loves them, but now you have to rewatch old ones so people don't get offended. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3608.0s)]
*  I think it'll come back at some point because I was watching The Hangover on TV the other day and I was like, people are going to be hungry for this shit. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3613.0s)]
*  Well, what's hilarious is the Daily Wire tried to do something, right? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3621.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3624.0s)]
*  They did something, right? [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3625.0s)]
*  They made a movie, right? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3626.0s)]
*  They made a movie about transgender athletes and a bunch of men who decide they're going to compete as women. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3627.0s)]
*  And then after that, there's a new thing that's been happening in Canada where they've got this, these two teams are playing against each other. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3633.0s)]
*  And there's five biological males that are identifying as females and dominating this volleyball game. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3645.0s)]
*  And the biological females, all of them are sitting on deck. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3655.0s)]
*  Why these five men? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3660.0s)]
*  They don't know why they're riding the bench? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3662.0s)]
*  Are crushing it. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3663.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3664.0s)]
*  There's five of them. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3665.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3666.0s)]
*  Like this is in Canada. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3667.0s)]
*  Like that is so insane. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3668.0s)]
*  You know what the thing is about those movies? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3672.0s)]
*  I saw the trailer for the Daily Wire thing. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3674.0s)]
*  I didn't see it. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3676.0s)]
*  But the thing about those movies is, and I didn't see this one, you got to remember if you're going that irreverent to have the heart of like a Fairly Brothers movie. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3677.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3684.0s)]
*  Because like something about Mary is a great movie because like you forget he's stalking this woman because he's so likable. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3685.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3690.0s)]
*  He's stalking Mary. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3691.0s)]
*  He hires a guy to stalk her. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3692.0s)]
*  But in the first scene, she's got a mentally challenged brother and he gets his ass kicked protecting her. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3694.0s)]
*  And you're like, he's a good guy. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3698.0s)]
*  So I think go for the fucking jugular, but make sure that you love the characters. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3700.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3704.0s)]
*  And also there's not a lot of really good. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3705.0s)]
*  How many people are really good at making those kind of movies? [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3712.0s)]
*  You know, there's a few people that like. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3715.0s)]
*  Todd Phillips went to serious movies, right? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3718.0s)]
*  You know, so he was like one of the last ones making like big hits. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3720.0s)]
*  But if that genre dries up, like that used to be a giant genre. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3723.0s)]
*  Like. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3728.0s)]

*  Dude, it's every line, every character there is just there to set up danger field. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3738.0s)]

*  Wow. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3855.0s)]
*  So it's breaking down his material and then breaking down stuff to talk about on the couch. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3856.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3860.0s)]

*  Holy shit. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3865.0s)]
*  Well, his story is so interesting, too, because he quit comedy for a long time and he's selling [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3866.0s)]
*  aluminum siding. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3869.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3873.0s)]

*  When he came back, he had all this material. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3877.0s)]

*  Right. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3883.0s)]
*  That's the classic. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3884.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3885.0s)]
*  But he came back and is that interesting? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3886.0s)]
*  Yeah, interesting. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3888.0s)]
*  I mean, dude, his movies are like, Caddyshack's great. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3889.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3893.0s)]
*  Fucking the one with Pesci. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3894.0s)]
*  Easy Money. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3896.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3897.0s)]
*  Hilarious. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3898.0s)]
*  Yeah, he had some bangers. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3899.0s)]
*  Even Meatwally Sparks. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3900.0s)]
*  I know it's like critics shit on the movie. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3901.0s)]
*  I love it. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3903.0s)]
*  I love the scene where he walks up to a couple on the dance floor and they're making out. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3904.0s)]
*  He's like, you two should go get a room. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3907.0s)]
*  And he walks up to a fatter couple. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3909.0s)]
*  He's like, you two should go get a warehouse. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3910.0s)]
*  It's like that's just like killer joke writing. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3913.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3916.0s)]
*  And with that face, he was one of those dudes. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3917.0s)]
*  His face was always funny. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3920.0s)]
*  I loved him. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3922.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's so good. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3923.0s)]
*  Just pure funny. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3924.0s)]
*  There's nothing else. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3926.0s)]
*  It's just I'm going to be funny. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3927.0s)]
*  And that's another example. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3929.0s)]
*  You go, you can say whatever he wants because it's like, I'm going to go help my kid at school. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3930.0s)]
*  These are good stories. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3935.0s)]
*  I mean, Sandler, Billy Madison, going back to school is a funny premise to put a silly guy around kids. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3937.0s)]
*  And he's the most immature one. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3943.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3945.0s)]
*  It's just a great. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3946.0s)]
*  It's a great premise. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3947.0s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3948.0s)]
*  Those movies, Sandler's movies don't get enough respect. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3951.0s)]
*  By me, they do. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3954.0s)]
*  I love Sandler. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3955.0s)]
*  But it drives me nuts when people shit on those movies because I'm like, what do you expecting this to be? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3956.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3963.0s)]
*  Because this is like a classic old timey comedy movie where it's just funny. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3964.0s)]
*  It's also like kind of his style of comedy is like weirdly kind of vulnerable the way how he's that silly. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3970.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3975.0s)]
*  You fall on your face doing that shit. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3976.0s)]
*  I mean, I did a bunch of road gigs with him. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3978.0s)]
*  He is the nicest fucking dude. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3980.0s)]
*  He's the nicest guy ever. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3982.0s)]
*  I would I would be more stressed playing basketball with him than I would doing the shows with him because I'm like, I just don't want to miss an open jump shot on Sandler's team. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3983.0s)]
*  He plays really good basketball. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3990.0s)]
*  He's good. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3993.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3994.0s)]
*  He had hip surgery, but he's still good. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3995.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3996.0s)]
*  What do you have? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3997.0s)]
*  He was like a year ago, but he can still play and it's maybe got a hip replacement. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=3998.0s)]
*  I forgot. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4002.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4003.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4004.0s)]
*  But he's you'll make like the no look pass. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4005.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4007.0s)]
*  It's really he's sick. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4008.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4009.0s)]
*  But it's funny playing on his team. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4010.0s)]
*  You get every fucking call. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4012.0s)]
*  Like I'm used to playing with people and they're just like, I didn't fucking foul you. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4013.0s)]
*  But what's like I must I must have hit you. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4016.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4019.0s)]
*  And who are the guys he's playing? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4021.0s)]
*  He's got a guy, Joe Vesty, who's really good. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4023.0s)]
*  Joe is joking hoop. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4025.0s)]
*  And then sometimes it's just his circle. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4027.0s)]
*  But then but then sometimes you go to the gym and he's just like playing with people at the gym. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4029.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4033.0s)]
*  Just random. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4034.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4035.0s)]
*  That's pretty fucking cool. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4036.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4037.0s)]
*  He's the fucking man. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4038.0s)]
*  It's very good, dude. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4039.0s)]
*  I was Zohan was on TV the other day. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4040.0s)]
*  That's a great movie. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4041.0s)]
*  It's fucking funny, dude. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4042.0s)]
*  Funny. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4043.0s)]
*  I was laughing brushing his teeth with hummus. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4044.0s)]
*  That's fucking hilarious. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4046.0s)]
*  There was a lot of funny shit in that movie. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4047.0s)]
*  I watched every Adam Sandler movie with my kids when we were locked down for the pandemic. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4049.0s)]
*  That was our thing. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4055.0s)]
*  We would just watch the comforting watches. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4056.0s)]
*  They're fun. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4058.0s)]
*  They're wholesome. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4059.0s)]
*  When they were, you know, nervous about what the fuck is going on in the world. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4060.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4063.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4064.0s)]
*  A lot of entertainment. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4065.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4066.0s)]
*  Just disconnect from things. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4067.0s)]
*  It was nice. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4068.0s)]
*  You need those those escape movies. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4069.0s)]
*  It's like so much. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4072.0s)]
*  Look, I want to watch the Oscar movies, too. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4075.0s)]
*  But some of them are like, all right, we get it. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4077.0s)]
*  It's fucking like 40 minutes in. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4079.0s)]
*  Nothing's happened. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4081.0s)]
*  And you're like, can something happen? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4082.0s)]
*  It is a movie. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4084.0s)]
*  It's supposed to be entertaining. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4085.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4086.0s)]
*  Do you watch any of those? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4087.0s)]
*  Like, I just watched Anatomy of a Fall. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4088.0s)]
*  I thought that was really good. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4089.0s)]
*  I don't know if you saw that. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4090.0s)]
*  What's that? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4091.0s)]
*  It's a French movie. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4092.0s)]
*  It's a guy falls. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4093.0s)]
*  They're in the Alps, I think. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4095.0s)]
*  And he falls out a window and dies, her husband. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4096.0s)]
*  And everyone thinks she killed him. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4099.0s)]
*  But it's one of those ambiguous movies where you're like, you kind of don't know. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4101.0s)]
*  It's really well done. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4105.0s)]
*  I watched American Fiction yesterday. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4106.0s)]
*  I thought that was pretty good. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4107.0s)]
*  American Fiction? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4109.0s)]
*  With Jeffrey Wright. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4110.0s)]
*  You know that guy? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4111.0s)]
*  No. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4112.0s)]
*  He's a really good actor. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4113.0s)]
*  He's almost like black Paul Giamatti. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4114.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4116.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's like a great character actor. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4117.0s)]
*  Yeah, this dude. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4119.0s)]
*  Oh, the guy who was in the West movie. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4120.0s)]
*  Westworld. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4123.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4124.0s)]
*  He's really good in Westworld. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4125.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is a good movie. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4126.0s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4127.0s)]
*  That guy's been in a bunch of things. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4128.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's fucking great. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4129.0s)]
*  He's always great. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4130.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then the holdovers with Paul Giamatti was really good, if you haven't seen that. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4131.0s)]
*  Westworld was pretty fucking good. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4134.0s)]
*  I got to watch it. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4136.0s)]
*  I've never seen it. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4137.0s)]
*  That was HBO 2, right? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4138.0s)]
*  Yeah, it got a little violent and Mrs. Rogan tapped out. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4139.0s)]
*  So I got kind of left stranded if she's not into watching it. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4142.0s)]
*  I've been there. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4146.0s)]
*  So I stopped watching it, but I really did love, I think, the first two seasons. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4147.0s)]
*  And as AI moves into our lives, that show doesn't seem ... it seems less and less weird, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4152.0s)]
*  less and less possible. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4160.0s)]
*  Like everything they're talking about doing on that show, I'm like, maybe someday they [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4162.0s)]
*  can fucking act ... [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4165.0s)]
*  Isn't that fucking crazy? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4166.0s)]
*  Maybe someday they're going to be able to do that. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4167.0s)]
*  Everything, from how they explained how they created this environment that seemed like [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4169.0s)]
*  it was another planet, that seemed like it was really the West, but it was really just [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4174.0s)]
*  in this domed environment. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4179.0s)]
*  Just even things like the Oculus, the new Apple vision, you're like, what is happening? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4181.0s)]
*  Bro, we're going to be so fucked in about five to ten years, because it's going to be [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4185.0s)]
*  too late to turn back and we're going to be embedded. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4191.0s)]
*  There's something going to happen where you're going to get an advantage from being connected [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4195.0s)]
*  to a network that you don't get without it, that's almost impossible to live without. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4200.0s)]
*  Like giving someone ... [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4204.0s)]
*  You mean like Twitter? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4205.0s)]
*  Like cell phones. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4206.0s)]
*  Yeah, but everything ... [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4207.0s)]
*  There's people that can get by without ... I know some people that have deleted Twitter. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4208.0s)]
*  They've just said, I don't want to do this anymore. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4211.0s)]
*  I know some people that have kicked it, but they don't kick cell phones. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4213.0s)]
*  You can't kick cell phones. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4217.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4218.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4219.0s)]
*  So if it becomes at that stage ... [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4220.0s)]
*  But if you're addicted, your cell phone has Twitter. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4222.0s)]
*  Unless you want to be one of those people who has a fucking 1999 Razr now. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4224.0s)]
*  Well, you can get the ... What is that simple phone? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4230.0s)]
*  I know a lot of people get that. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4233.0s)]
*  It's like you can't do anything on it. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4235.0s)]
*  It'll store music. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4238.0s)]
*  I think all it does is text message and make phone calls. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4240.0s)]
*  I don't even know if you can do email on it. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4243.0s)]
*  But people need email. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4246.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4247.0s)]
*  You're going to carry a second device just for email? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4248.0s)]
*  What if you're involved in some sort of business decision and need to be on the fly, able to respond to an email? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4251.0s)]
*  You unplug for a few hours and you're like, what did I miss? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4256.0s)]
*  A light phone? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4260.0s)]
*  Oh, light phone. Is that it? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4261.0s)]
*  I don't know if this is the only one, but this is what I'm saying right here. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4262.0s)]
*  Get rid of click bait, social media, minimal ... [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4265.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is it. Yep, that's it. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4267.0s)]
*  Email. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4269.0s)]
*  It's an experience we all call going light. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4270.0s)]
*  No email. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4272.0s)]
*  Going light. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4273.0s)]
*  No internet browser. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4274.0s)]
*  But it's probably better for you. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4275.0s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4277.0s)]
*  I mean, people who ... Ari will do that. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4278.0s)]
*  He'll get back to me and be like, sorry, I was in fucking ... [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4280.0s)]
*  Thailand. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4283.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was in Thailand. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4284.0s)]
*  Yeah, he'll do it. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4285.0s)]
*  But he's got an iPhone too. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4287.0s)]
*  He should shut the fuck up. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4289.0s)]
*  He gave in. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4290.0s)]
*  Everybody gives in. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4291.0s)]
*  You got to give in. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4292.0s)]
*  He's got to give in. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4293.0s)]
*  It's too good. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4294.0s)]
*  Also, you miss out on things. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4295.0s)]
*  Like if ... Tom Seger and I almost every day send each other the most horrific accidents, disasters, boulders, crashing fucking cars that are on mountain roads. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4297.0s)]
*  Everything fucked up we send back and forth to each other. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4309.0s)]
*  And if I didn't have the ability to click on the link, I'm missing a little bit of joy in my day. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4312.0s)]
*  And your connection to your friends. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4318.0s)]
*  Yeah, your connection to your friends. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4320.0s)]
*  Because that's what the joy ... the joy is not in watching people get gored by bulls. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4321.0s)]
*  The joy is that me and my friend have this unspoken agreement to send each other the worst shit we could find every day. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4325.0s)]
*  And find jokes in that. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4333.0s)]
*  And that's like, you know, when people say like dark jokes and stuff, it's like, no, you make ... that's a light joke. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4335.0s)]
*  You took a dark subject and you're finding light jokes about it, you know? [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4340.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're lightening up the situation slightly. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4343.0s)]
*  But that's the problem is like, you're right. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4346.0s)]
*  You're disconnected on these phones. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4349.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4351.0s)]
*  But then you're also connected. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4352.0s)]
*  So it's like now you're ... it's kind of a catch-22. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4353.0s)]
*  Whichever way you do it, you're a little fucked. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4356.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're fucked. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4359.0s)]
*  You're going to miss out on things if you're disconnected. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4360.0s)]
*  And if you're too connected, you're going to be addicted and fucking losing all your life energy and time and attention to nonsense. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4363.0s)]
*  Which is what a lot of people are doing all day long. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4372.0s)]
*  You're just scrolling through nonsense. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4374.0s)]
*  You just get nonsense in front of your face. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4376.0s)]
*  It's just ... there's nothing nourishing about it. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4378.0s)]
*  Nothing is like exciting your mind. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4381.0s)]
*  It's just dumb thing after dumb thing after dumb thing after dumb thing. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4383.0s)]
*  And the thing that doesn't do that is podcasts, which is interesting. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4388.0s)]
*  Yeah, I try to listen to like ... [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4393.0s)]
*  Because it's like the antidote for that. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4394.0s)]
*  Or books on tape. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4395.0s)]
*  Books on tape are great. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4397.0s)]
*  Fantastic. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4398.0s)]
*  It's a great thing to do. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4399.0s)]
*  I do ... think about how much we're on the move. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4400.0s)]
*  It's great for flights. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4402.0s)]
*  Great for like in your car ride. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4403.0s)]
*  You might get nauseous if you read. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4404.0s)]
*  But I think about how invasive it's going to be because there's wheelchairs now that can be driven by neurological impulses. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4406.0s)]
*  So it's like, okay, that's your fucking thoughts? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4412.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4415.0s)]
*  It can read your thoughts. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4416.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4418.0s)]
*  Like how far ... I have a lot of bad thoughts, Joe. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4419.0s)]
*  Yeah, I bet you do. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4421.0s)]
*  I bet you do when you're on those morning shows. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4422.0s)]
*  Imagine if you could get arrested for your thoughts. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4424.0s)]
*  Like, because I think some things that I would never do. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4426.0s)]
*  You got to erase your browser mind thoughts too. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4429.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4431.0s)]
*  Like erase your history. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4432.0s)]
*  Could you imagine if you could ... if you had an impulse to just smash someone in the face but you were resisting it? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4433.0s)]
*  You weren't going to do it. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4440.0s)]
*  Are you a good person if you're resisting it constantly? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4441.0s)]
*  Uh, it depends on who you're talking to. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4444.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4446.0s)]
*  If you're the asshole all the time, you're constantly getting in fights with people, it might be you. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4447.0s)]
*  We all know that person who's like, this fucking asshole. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4453.0s)]
*  Like everyone's an asshole in your stories. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4455.0s)]
*  But there's also times when some people need to be smacked. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4457.0s)]
*  And there's those ... in those moments, like imagine if you could get arrested because you tested positive for a potential aggressive episode. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4459.0s)]
*  It's like a COVID test, you get two lines. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4473.0s)]
*  You're keeping your shit together but you're imagining ... you're imagining just teeing off on this guy, just smashing this dude. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4475.0s)]
*  He could be a danger. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4482.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like, hey man, just stop doing it. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4483.0s)]
*  But if you have that thought, I'm about to smash that guy. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4486.0s)]
*  De de de de de. A light goes off, the cops come in and they arrest you. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4488.0s)]
*  And they arrest you because you had a potentially violent episode. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4493.0s)]
*  You hit red line. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4497.0s)]
*  You're red flag. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4498.0s)]
*  Sam, this is a serious thing. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4500.0s)]
*  You went to red line. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4502.0s)]
*  But I didn't do anything. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4503.0s)]
*  But you might have. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4504.0s)]
*  Or they'll tell you you were going to. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4505.0s)]
*  We know. We have predictive technology here in Westworld. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4507.0s)]
*  Predictive technology. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4511.0s)]
*  Or yeah, movie minority report. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4512.0s)]
*  Yes. That seemed so impossible. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4513.0s)]
*  Predicting murders though. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4517.0s)]
*  Now it's like ... the World Economic Forum guy was saying that they won't have to have elections in the future. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4518.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4524.0s)]
*  We will be able to predict with such precision that we don't need elections. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4525.0s)]
*  Save a lot of money though. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4528.0s)]
*  Did you see this story going around? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4529.0s)]
*  What? [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4531.0s)]
*  British man acquitted over London, Spain flight bomb hoax? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4532.0s)]
*  He texted and Snapchat to his friends on the way to blow up the plane. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4536.0s)]
*  I'm a member of the Taliban. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4542.0s)]
*  Then ... [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4543.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4544.0s)]
*  The Spanish ... [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4545.0s)]
*  As a joke? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4546.0s)]
*  As a joke. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4547.0s)]
*  He said it was a joke to his friends. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4548.0s)]
*  That's a good bet. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4550.0s)]
*  And two Spanish F-18s were scrambled to ... [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4551.0s)]
*  Look how close the F-18 is to that other jet's wing. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4554.0s)]
*  Very close. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4556.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4557.0s)]
*  He was just acquitted though because the judge was like there's obviously no threat here. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4558.0s)]
*  But what was curious is how the message was found because Snapchat is supposed to be encrypted. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4561.0s)]
*  And some people think it's because of the Wi-Fi network at the airport. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4569.0s)]
*  And the airport says that's not how it was. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4572.0s)]
*  And then the UK authorities said ... where was it right here? [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4576.0s)]
*  So is this evidence of some new technology? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4579.0s)]
*  That would mean ... as you guys were saying this stuff, that's why I brought it up. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4581.0s)]
*  Do you think that's what they're ... what are you interpreting this as? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4584.0s)]
*  They said that they have ... for unknown reasons it was captured by the security mechanisms of England when the plane was flying over French airspace. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4587.0s)]
*  Yo. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4594.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4595.0s)]
*  Yo, that's crazy. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4596.0s)]
*  The message was made in a strictly private environment between the accused and his friends with whom he flew through a private group to which only they have access. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4599.0s)]
*  So the accused could not even remotely assume that the joke he played on his friends could be intercepted or detected by British services, nor by third parties other than his friends who received the message. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4609.0s)]
*  See, that's crazy because sometimes you'll say wild shit to your friends in a text message. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4622.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4627.0s)]
*  For fun. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4628.0s)]
*  And you're assuming, if I send you an iMessage, you're assuming that that's encrypted. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4629.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to stop telling my friends I'm going to murder my girlfriend. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4634.0s)]
*  You have to use signal. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4637.0s)]
*  You have to use signal. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4638.0s)]
*  You have to be careful. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4639.0s)]
*  You have to use signal for that. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4640.0s)]
*  Today is the day. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4641.0s)]
*  I'll say that. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4642.0s)]
*  But I bet if you'd have used signal, I bet they're looking through signal too. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4643.0s)]
*  I bet there is a scanning that's being done on all cell phone communication looking for key target words that they think would be problematic. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4645.0s)]
*  Well, think about how much of our freedom we're constantly giving away. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4657.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4660.0s)]
*  I don't ... when I fly, I don't want to wait on the long line. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4661.0s)]
*  So I give them my iris, my fingerprint, all that stuff. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4663.0s)]
*  Now those lines are longer than the other lines. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4666.0s)]
*  Are they? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4669.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4670.0s)]
*  If I go to LaGuardia, fucking Precheck and Clear are the longest lines now. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4671.0s)]
*  No shit. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4674.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4675.0s)]
*  So sometimes you just fuck it and you go through the other one? [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4676.0s)]
*  Yeah, I take my shoes off again. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4678.0s)]
*  I'm going backward. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4679.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4680.0s)]
*  But then there's going to probably be a new line. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4681.0s)]
*  You've got to give more ... you dip your balls in the fucking thing. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4682.0s)]
*  You've got to give them the outline of your penis. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4685.0s)]
*  I gave you my penis. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4687.0s)]
*  You've got to let me cut. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4688.0s)]
*  Well, you have to have the update and the chip. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4689.0s)]
*  Do you have your update? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4691.0s)]
*  You can fly if you have your update. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4692.0s)]
*  Did you update your date? [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4694.0s)]
*  Did you update your date? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4695.0s)]
*  Did you update your brain? [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4696.0s)]
*  We only have your flaccid penis. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4697.0s)]
*  We need a hard penis. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4698.0s)]
*  If you have the brain chip, we'll let you pass through. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4699.0s)]
*  You don't ever have to worry about identification ever again. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4702.0s)]
*  I thought of a new wrinkle for that. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4706.0s)]
*  I can let you update right there at the airport with some janky terminal that's probably hacked [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4707.0s)]
*  or you could do it at home like everybody else would probably be doing it when you update. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4712.0s)]
*  Update from a safe place. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4716.0s)]
*  Update from a safe place. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4717.0s)]
*  Or you could do it here. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4718.0s)]
*  It's like a subway terminal. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4719.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4721.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4722.0s)]
*  It'll get to the point where you'll just have an account in your head and you won't have [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4723.0s)]
*  to pay for anything with a credit card ever again. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4727.0s)]
*  It'll all be an account in your head, but only through Central Bank Digital Currency. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4730.0s)]
*  If you subscribe to Central Bank Digital Currency, we can eye on out all the inequality and all [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4734.0s)]
*  the problems of society today. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4740.0s)]
*  They'll get us. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4743.0s)]
*  They'll get us. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4744.0s)]
*  They're going to get us with a chip in our head. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4745.0s)]
*  It's going to be awesome. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4746.68s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4747.68s)]
*  You're going to put that chip in and you go, God, why was I resisting this? [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4748.68s)]
*  I was so stupid just 20 minutes ago. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4752.56s)]
*  Now I get it. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4754.72s)]
*  If you imagine, you can only imagine being as intelligent as you are on your best or [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4757.92s)]
*  worst days, but could you imagine being like a caveman, like an Australia Pythagoras, like [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4762.92s)]
*  the early days, just barbaric life covered in hair, and then somebody gives you something, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4771.88s)]
*  just a little shot or something, and all of a sudden you can think like you. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4780.32s)]
*  You'd be like, whoa, I didn't realize how fucking dumb I was. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4783.400000000001s)]
*  I think we're going to plug in and it's going to be so, whoa, oh my God, this is so much [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4788.04s)]
*  better. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4793.96s)]
*  This is so much better. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4794.96s)]
*  This is so much better than regular brains. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4795.96s)]
*  We're just going to accept the fact that we have access to information constantly. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4798.400000000001s)]
*  You're seeing it all in your head. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4802.8s)]
*  That's just Adderall right now, I think. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4804.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, it's probably going to be better than Adderall. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4806.6s)]
*  It's probably going to be better. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4809.84s)]
*  If you could have something that stimulates various parts of your brain to produce certain [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4811.12s)]
*  neurochemicals, if that's possible, they're going to be able to do something where people [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4815.48s)]
*  that are paralyzed can use cursors. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4820.16s)]
*  Use their brain to figure out how to navigate computers. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4825.96s)]
*  Yeah, wow. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4830.08s)]
*  That's pretty, but again, it's intrusive, right? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4832.4s)]
*  It's your thoughts. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4835.6s)]
*  Right, but if you're a paralyzed person, it's a really good thing. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4836.6s)]
*  It's way better to be able to do that than not. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4840.96s)]
*  That's true. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4842.92s)]
*  But once we start doing it too, Sam, I know you're not paralyzed, but let me tell you [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4843.92s)]
*  the benefits of linking up. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4851.08s)]
*  And you just start talking to your girlfriend. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4854.68s)]
*  It's going to be like Jehovah's Witnesses. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4856.280000000001s)]
*  They're going to be banging on your door. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4857.56s)]
*  It's thinking about linking up. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4858.56s)]
*  I mean, my cousin linked up. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4859.56s)]
*  He's never felt better. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4861.280000000001s)]
*  He signed a one-year lease. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4862.280000000001s)]
*  You link up for one year. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4865.120000000001s)]
*  You can't disconnect or they kill you. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4866.24s)]
*  It'll be like Ozempic. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4868.36s)]
*  You give the linked up people a year to see how they do, and then you're like, I might [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4870.08s)]
*  link up. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4873.2s)]
*  No, it'll be like military service. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4874.2s)]
*  If you're going to link up, you have to link up. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4876.84s)]
*  You have to commit to one year because you're contributing to the grid. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4878.32s)]
*  You're contributing to the grid of ideas if you link up. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4881.24s)]
*  So you have to keep it on for one year. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4883.88s)]
*  And most people don't take it off. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4885.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4920.08s)]

*  If you really want to be completely self-sufficient, like wow. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4956.76s)]
*  The only reason we can do all the things that we do is because so many other people provide [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4960.36s)]
*  you with the stuff that would take up all your time, which is gathering food, eating [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4966.0s)]

*  Yeah, hunting is a sport for people. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4977.2s)]
*  It's not like a thing that most people do. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4978.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4981.48s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of people who do it by choice, but they definitely don't need [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=4982.48s)]

*  Whoa. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5040.76s)]

*  I didn't want to be a waitress. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5049.76s)]
*  If you look at your fucking salary as a teacher versus you like, oh, I just made my whole [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5052.0s)]

*  But if you're contributing to OnlyFans, make sure you have the money. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5067.759999999999s)]
*  I have a friend who fucking pays for OnlyFans and he has never seen The Sopranos. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5070.96s)]
*  If I was a gal, I would be worried about dudes becoming obsessed with you from something [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5076.04s)]
*  like that. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5080.44s)]

*  I mean, it's like... [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5088.44s)]
*  But if you're a female comic, I think they become obsessed with you too. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5090.5199999999995s)]

*  What happened with Microsoft? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5437.08s)]

*  He's definitely screaming, but it looked like he was smiling. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5461.6s)]
*  But like Jobs and Musk, I feel like they will put you to your breaking point doing shit [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5464.120000000001s)]
*  you didn't think you could accomplish. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5467.72s)]

*  Yeah, I've heard that about both of them. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5472.080000000001s)]
*  But I guess, just grab any one. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5474.200000000001s)]

*  So he always was like, didn't show many respect. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5785.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5788.36s)]
*  This is the guy he played. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5789.36s)]
*  Tom White, very interesting guy. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5790.719999999999s)]
*  Scroll that scroll higher. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5795.12s)]
*  What does the article say? [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5796.12s)]
*  This is just like vector fiction about the movie. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5798.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5801.44s)]
*  I just don't know what happened. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5802.44s)]
*  The guy Leo played is just like a dumb fuck who kind of went along. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5803.44s)]
*  It just was a character I didn't think had a lot of depth. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5805.679999999999s)]
*  It's like just spending three and a half hours with a guy who's like going along with murder [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5808.48s)]
*  and was, is kind of dumb. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5811.5599999999995s)]
*  That's a weird thing they do when they take what is an actual piece of history and have [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5813.24s)]
*  someone play like when Sophia Vergara is playing Griselda Blanco, which is insanity. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5818.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5827.96s)]
*  Fucking insanity. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5828.96s)]
*  Like what? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5829.96s)]
*  She's like one of the hottest human beings that's ever lived. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5830.96s)]
*  Got to sell tickets. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5833.8s)]
*  She's playing this lady that was a psychopath and a murderer. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5834.8s)]
*  They just do things like that in movies. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5841.4800000000005s)]
*  They just, they'll monkey with the past if they think it's better this way. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5843.12s)]
*  Or they ug up a hot guy instead of just getting a fucking weird looking actor. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5846.4400000000005s)]
*  Yep. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5850.6s)]
*  They ug up a hot guy. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5851.6s)]
*  Or they pretend the guy was hot. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5852.6s)]
*  She won an award for being ugly and monster. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5854.08s)]
*  Yeah, but she actually pulled it off. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5856.5599999999995s)]
*  She's great, but it's just funny. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5858.16s)]
*  Shaved her eyebrows. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5859.16s)]
*  But they could have gotten an uglier actress. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5860.16s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5862.16s)]
*  There's a solid point. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5864.04s)]
*  There's hot privilege. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5865.04s)]
*  Solid point. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5866.04s)]
*  There's a really solid point. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5867.04s)]
*  But she also had a famous actress privilege. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5868.04s)]
*  For sure. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5870.4s)]
*  And that's right, as I said, you want to sell tickets. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5871.4s)]
*  Famous actress privilege trumps everything because they sell tickets. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5874.12s)]
*  For sure. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5877.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5878.36s)]
*  So if she decides to get fat for the movie, give her a shot at it. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5879.36s)]
*  Come on. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5882.799999999999s)]
*  She can't do it, but Robert De Niro can do it. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5884.2s)]
*  She was so good in that movie, too. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5887.12s)]
*  And she went back to hot again. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5888.84s)]
*  She's hot. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5890.4800000000005s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5891.4800000000005s)]
*  Because how many women out there look like Shalize Theron did in Monster who could actually, [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5892.4800000000005s)]
*  the right diet plan, pull it together and start looking like her. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5899.16s)]
*  Some people start, I don't know, Christian Bale, that can't be healthy, what he does [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5903.28s)]
*  to his body all the time. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5907.52s)]
*  Well, what he did in that movie, The Machinist, is dangerous. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5908.52s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5911.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5912.6s)]
*  And McConaughey did the same thing in Dallas Fire's Club. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5913.6s)]
*  But his face looks fucking skinny still. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5915.56s)]
*  He was lighter or less weight, I should say, in The Fighter, which was after the... [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5917.04s)]
*  Or no, this shit is... [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5921.88s)]
*  The Fighter's good. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5922.88s)]
*  I saw another picture of this shit. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5923.88s)]
*  He got more skinny in that when he played Mickey Ward's brother. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5924.88s)]
*  I should say it now. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5930.280000000001s)]
*  That wasn't enough. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5931.280000000001s)]
*  Dicky something, right? [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5932.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Dicky Betts. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5933.280000000001s)]
*  It was a meme that showed their weight, so it might happen now. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5934.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, 66 kilograms and that was 55 kilograms. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5936.320000000001s)]
*  This can't be healthy. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5939.08s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5940.08s)]
*  It's real bad. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5941.08s)]
*  It's real bad. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5942.52s)]
*  It's real dangerous. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5944.4400000000005s)]
*  Super, super dangerous. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5945.4400000000005s)]
*  But De Niro got shredded in Raging Bull and Cape Fear. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5946.4400000000005s)]
*  Shredded is okay, but he's starving to death there. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5949.4800000000005s)]
*  That's why he's so thin. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5952.52s)]
*  That can't be fine. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5953.52s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5954.52s)]
*  It's very, very, very, very, very dangerous. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5955.52s)]
*  It's dangerous for your heart. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5957.68s)]
*  It's dangerous for your organs. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5958.72s)]
*  It's dangerous for your kidneys. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5960.280000000001s)]
*  It's dangerous for everything. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5961.4800000000005s)]
*  It's very, very, very, very dangerous to do that. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5962.76s)]
*  And so unnecessary for a movie that was mid. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5966.56s)]
*  The movie was just not that good. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5970.240000000001s)]
*  That movie wasn't X-Mocking. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5972.08s)]
*  I didn't even see it. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5973.08s)]
*  X-Mocking is sick. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5974.08s)]
*  Woo, it's a sick movie. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5975.08s)]
*  Talking about AI. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5976.08s)]
*  But you know what I'm saying? [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5977.08s)]
*  If you get skinny for that because she left you in that box with nothing but water and [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5978.08s)]
*  they come back. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5980.72s)]
*  You know, remember at the end of the movie when he gets spoiler alert, when he gets [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5981.72s)]
*  stuck in there and she just walks away? [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5985.96s)]
*  Killer. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5988.08s)]
*  Bro, how far away are we from that? [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5989.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5991.08s)]
*  She was a pretty hot robot. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5992.08s)]
*  Oh, she was so hot. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5993.08s)]
*  Do you think you would ever fuck a robot? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5994.08s)]
*  100%. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5995.64s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5996.64s)]
*  Yeah, it was her. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5997.64s)]
*  If she was talking to me like that. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5998.64s)]
*  I think I would fuck a robot. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=5999.64s)]
*  I'd give her a go. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6001.4800000000005s)]
*  I'd see what it is. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6002.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, especially if I'm some scientist dork on an island somewhere and there's a [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6003.4800000000005s)]
*  hot robot that I'm supposed to interact with and she knows how to press my buttons. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6007.52s)]
*  I'm working on a bit on stage which is like, we're going to fuck robots but I think it's [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6011.4800000000005s)]
*  going to be like a cell phone. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6015.92s)]
*  Like everyone's going to need a robot. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6016.92s)]
*  But like if you're poor you're going to have like a lower level model. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6018.76s)]
*  Like maybe while you're fucking it you get ads. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6021.360000000001s)]

*  I've watched that so many times on planes when I'm like going through my laptop. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6053.72s)]
*  I'm like what do I got on here? [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6057.2s)]
*  I like a good psychological thriller with three characters. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6058.88s)]
*  So it's almost more like a play. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6061.68s)]
*  It's like all dialogue heavy and just fucking like that could have been a play. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6063.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6066.64s)]
*  And it's so fascinating to watch this kid trying to work all this out. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6067.64s)]
*  You know like work out that he got this opportunity. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6071.6s)]
*  Work out that he's there. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6074.12s)]
*  So who's the actor? [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6075.72s)]
*  Dom Hall Gleason. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6077.28s)]
*  Isn't that him? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6078.28s)]
*  Perfectly awkward. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6079.72s)]
*  You know everything about him. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6081.2s)]
*  His origin story. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6082.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6083.52s)]
*  Everything. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6084.52s)]
*  Perfectly vulnerable. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6085.52s)]
*  And when he gets stuck at the end of the movie you're like oh my god. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6087.52s)]
*  That's real. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6093.040000000001s)]
*  That's real. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6094.040000000001s)]
*  Because you kind of know it's coming but you also kind of want to believe a little bit. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6095.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6099.240000000001s)]
*  Just because a baby deer is cute doesn't mean the mountain lion won't get it. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6100.240000000001s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6107.240000000001s)]
*  He got fucking. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6108.240000000001s)]
*  We think he's a good guy. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6109.240000000001s)]
*  He's a good guy. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6110.240000000001s)]
*  He's doing the right thing and then him banging on the glass and you don't hear a sound. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6111.240000000001s)]
*  Like oh my god you're going to die in there. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6116.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6119.48s)]
*  You're going to die in there. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6120.48s)]
*  824 makes a lot of cool shit. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6121.48s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6122.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6123.48s)]
*  Just banging on it and knowing you ain't putting a fucking dent in it. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6124.48s)]
*  You are going nowhere. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6128.08s)]
*  Forever. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6130.8s)]
*  It's I like. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6131.8s)]
*  When she just shoved the knife in him. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6133.8s)]
*  I love un-Hollywood endings dude. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6136.8s)]
*  I love when they don't give the people. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6138.68s)]
*  And a lot of those movies bomb because people want a happy ending. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6141.28s)]
*  I think one of Woody Allen's best movies ever is Purple Rose of Cairo and it's a fucking [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6144.96s)]
*  downer of an ending. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6149.8s)]
*  And I think that's probably why it's one of his biggest bombs. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6151.28s)]
*  You know what it's going to be like. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6154.04s)]
*  You can have a robot and you can have a robot for a wife. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6155.04s)]
*  But that robot for a wife if she catches you doing anything. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6158.5s)]
*  If you do anything that's illegal. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6162.68s)]
*  You get a like a red light code and she detains you. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6165.04s)]
*  Because your robot wife is stronger than you. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6168.96s)]
*  You can fuck this like really hot robot wife and she looks like just a really hot woman. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6172.08s)]
*  We're all going to be subs? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6176.320000000001s)]
*  Super sexy but what she really is is a murderous robot capable of pulling your fucking head [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6177.76s)]
*  right off your body. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6183.280000000001s)]
*  How far are we from robot wars then? [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6184.4800000000005s)]
*  Like we'll have American robots versus Russian robots? [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6186.96s)]
*  We're already dealing with drones. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6189.16s)]
*  That's true. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6190.16s)]
*  What is a missile? [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6191.16s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6192.16s)]
*  What's a guided missile? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6193.16s)]
*  It's kind of a robot. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6194.16s)]
*  What's those supersonic guided missiles? [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6195.16s)]
*  But drone veterans are fucking not as cool as actual on the ground war veterans. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6196.6s)]
*  No they're definitely not. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6200.68s)]
*  But do you know that they suffer from a very specific type of PTSD? [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6201.92s)]
*  They probably should. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6205.280000000001s)]
*  They're killing people. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6206.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6207.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6208.280000000001s)]
*  And imagine watching that on a screen. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6209.280000000001s)]
*  But your scars are not from being on the battlefield. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6210.280000000001s)]
*  They're from tripping over like a fucking router or something. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6211.72s)]
*  You know it's a different type of PTSD. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6214.120000000001s)]
*  It's definitely a different type of PTSD but apparently they're haunted. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6217.160000000001s)]
*  They're haunted. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6220.72s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6222.120000000001s)]
*  You're playing God. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6223.120000000001s)]

*  You're doing it a weird way where you're watching a screen. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6227.72s)]
*  So you're kind of like it's familiar. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6230.64s)]
*  It's like a video game. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6231.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6233.04s)]

*  Any of those games require fast twitch. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6242.16s)]
*  If you give them a responsive enough interface and some sort of insane weapon, they could [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6243.78s)]
*  do fucking damage. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6249.24s)]

*  There's just such a variety of people and we lump them all into the same thing. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6569.44s)]
*  That's why it gets so offensive when someone you know just wants to like single out one [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=6572.679999999999s)]

*  And he goes, skaters were here first. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7267.12s)]
*  I'm like, oh great, now this is like the Middle East we're fucking arguing about. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7269.0s)]
*  Dude, just let us have it. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7272.719999999999s)]
*  And it escalated and I was like, hey man, I don't want to argue. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7274.24s)]
*  And he was like, me neither. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7276.5199999999995s)]
*  I was like, all right, good. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7277.5199999999995s)]
*  But you get the wrong guy. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7278.5199999999995s)]
*  You're like, fuck. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7279.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7280.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, there's guys who look for things like that. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7281.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7282.5199999999995s)]
*  Especially guys who know how to fight a little bit and they'll just decide- [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7283.5199999999995s)]
*  They want to show off a little. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7286.599999999999s)]
*  They want to show off and they want to tee off on your face. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7287.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7290.0s)]
*  Especially if they come from abused backgrounds or their dad beat them or something like that. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7291.0s)]
*  Those are fucking dangerous people because they're so used to violence. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7295.280000000001s)]
*  They're so used to violence that violence to them is like first choice. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7298.8s)]
*  They're ready to smack you because people have been smacking them their whole life. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7303.320000000001s)]
*  My biological father was just distant so I think I'm passive because I don't want to [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7307.52s)]
*  argue even. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7312.160000000001s)]
*  I like shrink kind of. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7313.160000000001s)]
*  I'm not that, but I think if you had an abusive dad, yeah, you're going to want to fucking [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7314.160000000001s)]
*  throw down probably. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7317.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7318.44s)]
*  There's a fine line with every interaction. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7319.44s)]
*  How much could this interaction have been different if I approached it different? [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7324.48s)]
*  How much of it could have been avoided if I was less defensive or if I was more friendly [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7329.28s)]
*  and disarming or if I was just more careful with my words? [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7335.36s)]
*  How much could I have manipulated this conversation or massaged this conversation? [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7340.2s)]
*  That's the thing you always have to think about when it comes to two people that don't [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7345.4s)]
*  know each other interacting with each other, especially if they're drunk after a show or [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7347.92s)]
*  something like that. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7354.44s)]
*  I hate bad drunks because I think I'm not a bad drunk. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7355.44s)]
*  At a certain age- [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7358.12s)]
*  I'm a happy drunk. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7359.12s)]
*  Me too. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7360.12s)]
*  I'm a nice drunk. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7361.12s)]
*  I will deny that I'm drunk when I'm drunk. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7362.12s)]
*  That's the one thing that's annoying. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7363.719999999999s)]
*  I will literally come home shit face and I'm like, I had one drink. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7365.24s)]
*  I had two drinks. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7369.36s)]
*  Dude, if you wake me up at four in the morning, I'll swear I was already awake. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7370.36s)]
*  I don't know why I lie. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7374.12s)]
*  No, I was awake. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7375.32s)]
*  It's the only lie I'll tell. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7376.32s)]
*  That's my lie. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7377.32s)]
*  It's that I'm not drunk. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7378.32s)]
*  My lie is I was asleep. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7379.32s)]
*  I wasn't asleep. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7380.32s)]
*  That's my lie. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7381.32s)]
*  For what? [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7382.32s)]
*  Why? [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7383.32s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7384.32s)]
*  I wish I knew. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7385.32s)]
*  It's like there's an answer in there somewhere. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7386.32s)]
*  But that's the one time I will definitely lie. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7388.32s)]
*  Not really. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7390.88s)]
*  Most of the time I'll probably tell the truth now. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7391.88s)]
*  But in my life, how many times have I lied when someone called to woke me up? [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7393.56s)]
*  99% of the time. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7397.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm always like, no, I'm awake. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7399.44s)]
*  I'm awake. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7401.0s)]
*  What's up? [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7402.0s)]
*  I've gotten better at saying I'm... [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7403.16s)]
*  Because I was at a Knicks game with my girl the other night and I was screaming at the [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7404.8s)]
*  ref and she was like, you're fucking drunk. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7408.24s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, you watched me drink. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7410.4s)]
*  I don't know why that's surprising. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7412.88s)]
*  You saw me and I was yelling at him, this is funny NBA ref. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7414.12s)]
*  He's like, this guy Tony Brothers, he's like a funny ref. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7417.92s)]
*  So I'm like, you stink, you're the worst ref. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7420.84s)]
*  And he just looks around and gives me one of these. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7423.24s)]
*  Just annoyed. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7426.24s)]
*  He's got a funny face. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7427.24s)]
*  He's a very sarcastic ref. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7429.2s)]
*  I've gotten better at admitting it, but for years I was like, I'm not drunk. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7432.68s)]
*  It came from just being a kid and coming home drunk and my mom being furious at me. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7435.64s)]
*  And just learning how to be a good drunk actor. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7439.0s)]
*  My parents would lock the door so I would just keep hitting the doorbell. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7441.6s)]
*  My face passed out half against the door. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7444.56s)]
*  So they'd open it and I'd fall flat on my face. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7446.28s)]
*  I was like 16 probably. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7449.0s)]
*  But I remember I was just puking my guts out and my mom would... [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7450.96s)]
*  She doesn't know how to deal with a drunk. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7453.8s)]
*  My mom doesn't drink. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7454.8s)]
*  So she would come in and bring me chamomile tea as I'm puking. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7455.8s)]
*  I'm like, perfect. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7458.08s)]
*  Yeah, this will solve it. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7459.08s)]
*  That'll do it. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7460.08s)]
*  You got any zucchinis back there? [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7461.32s)]
*  Fucking serve with it? [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7463.16s)]
*  The fucking chamomile tea? [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7465.16s)]
*  She didn't know. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7467.16s)]
*  She was just trying to help. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7468.16s)]
*  That's so insane. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7469.16s)]
*  No, I mean, I can't stand bad drunks. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7470.16s)]
*  Oh, they're terrible. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7473.04s)]
*  I don't mind if you're just a little sloppy, but if you're an aggressive drunk man, there's [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7474.04s)]
*  something... [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7478.12s)]
*  I... [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7479.12s)]
*  Nah. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7480.12s)]
*  I got no time for that shit. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7481.12s)]
*  And it's always like, how much do I have invested in you? [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7482.12s)]
*  How much do I know you? [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7486.08s)]
*  Know you? [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7487.08s)]
*  Really? [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7488.08s)]
*  I mean, it's just an off night and you're like, you're all right, dude. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7489.08s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7491.12s)]
*  Give him a hug and go, bro, you were crazy. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7492.12s)]
*  You were crazy. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7494.12s)]
*  You were trying to fight cops. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7495.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7496.12s)]
*  That's the thing too. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7497.12s)]
*  I was, I really... [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7498.12s)]
*  Yeah, you tried to fight a cop, man. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7499.12s)]
*  Come on. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7500.12s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7501.12s)]
*  I'm compassionate because I drink. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7502.12s)]
*  So if someone's badly behaved, I'm like, hey, as long as they're not like a huge asshole, [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7503.12s)]
*  I don't want people kicked out of my shows ever. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7506.68s)]
*  So I'm very, very gentle with that. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7508.6s)]
*  But at the same time, I think people... [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7510.96s)]
*  I remember a guy threw a fucking bottle at David Tell's head and he was just like... [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7514.16s)]
*  I think he gave the guy's friend bail money for the guy. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7518.16s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7521.5599999999995s)]
*  Because he's that fucking nice. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7522.5599999999995s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7524.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7525.76s)]
*  I'm not that nice. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7526.76s)]
*  No, I'm not that nice. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7527.76s)]
*  He threw a bottle at my head. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7528.76s)]
*  Yeah, the Comedy Store in the dark days, the dark days of like the 90s, the Comedy Store [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7530.32s)]
*  was totally unpoliced. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7535.44s)]
*  I hate that. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7537.44s)]
*  And there was no crowd control. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7538.44s)]
*  It was terrible. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7539.44s)]

*  You see old clips of Tom Green. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7791.6s)]

*  He was innovative. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7797.72s)]
*  I credit him to being one of the inspirations for me starting this for sure. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7798.88s)]
*  I love him. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7802.88s)]
*  Do you ever see his show? [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7803.88s)]
*  Tom Green's show? [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7804.88s)]
*  Did you ever do the show, the in-house show? [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7805.88s)]
*  The in-house show is incredible. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7808.280000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you were, when did you start standup? [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7809.280000000001s)]
*  2005. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7812.280000000001s)]

*  Tom Green had an internet show in his house. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7815.360000000001s)]
*  No, I remember the clips. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7818.4800000000005s)]
*  I was obsessed with his MTV show. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7820.240000000001s)]
*  It was amazing. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7822.2s)]
*  It's in an Eminem song. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7823.2s)]
*  He made a fucking Eminem song. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7824.2s)]
*  One I remember all the time is Undercutters Pizza where he would just follow people. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7829.08s)]
*  He'd follow a pizza delivery guy and bring all the toppings in a suitcase and he'd be [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7832.879999999999s)]
*  like, we're Undercutters Pizza. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7836.48s)]
*  We'll charge you less to the guy he was delivering it to. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7837.92s)]
*  The guy fucking tried to kick his ass. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7840.879999999999s)]
*  It was so stupid and funny. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7842.719999999999s)]
*  I think he was pretty great. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7846.24s)]
*  He got really good at standup too, by the way. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7849.679999999999s)]
*  He really did. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7851.4s)]
*  He's doing a mothership soon. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7852.4s)]
*  This is it. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7855.24s)]
*  The guy wanted to fucking kick his ass. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7856.24s)]
*  I remember when he smashed his testicle live on air because he got it removed from when [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7858.08s)]
*  he had cancer. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7863.0s)]
*  I respect him a lot. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7865.0s)]
*  He's coming soon. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7869.48s)]
*  He's going to be on the podcast soon too. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7870.48s)]
*  He's great. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7871.48s)]
*  He's underappreciated. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7872.48s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like that. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7873.48s)]
*  I really like his standup. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7875.48s)]
*  He's a big name still. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7877.48s)]
*  He is, but I don't think people... [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7878.48s)]
*  Freddie Got Fingered is a fucking great movie. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7881.16s)]
*  Insane. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7883.24s)]
*  It's a great movie. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7884.24s)]
*  I remember three people in the movie theater opening day when it came out. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7885.24s)]
*  The other two, my friends. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7888.24s)]
*  Empty movie theater. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7889.24s)]
*  It was an empty movie. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7890.24s)]
*  It didn't pan out commercially, but my friend Eddie Bravo told me about it. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7891.679999999999s)]
*  He goes, dude, I know everybody says it sucks. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7895.0s)]
*  Go see Freddie Got Fingered. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7898.639999999999s)]
*  I went, really? [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7899.639999999999s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7900.639999999999s)]
*  He goes, it's so funny. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7901.639999999999s)]
*  He jerks off a horse. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7902.639999999999s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7903.639999999999s)]
*  Or an elephant, whatever. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7904.639999999999s)]
*  Whatever. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7905.639999999999s)]
*  No, he... [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7906.639999999999s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7907.639999999999s)]
*  It's so silly. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7908.639999999999s)]
*  He's ahead of his time. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7909.639999999999s)]
*  He was ahead of his time. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7910.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he sucks off a cow or something. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7911.639999999999s)]
*  He's out of his mind. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7914.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of the last movies, I feel like, that got destroyed by critics. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7915.48s)]
*  It's when critics still had their power and it was like a zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7919.08s)]
*  or whatever and they were like... [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7923.16s)]
*  It's like back... [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7924.919999999999s)]
*  Think about it. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7925.919999999999s)]
*  Critics can't do that shit anymore. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7926.919999999999s)]
*  I don't think that had Rotten Tomatoes back then. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7927.919999999999s)]
*  But whatever it was, it was like... [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7928.919999999999s)]
*  It was like Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7929.919999999999s)]
*  Being like, this sucks. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7931.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7932.879999999999s)]
*  Ebert's a great reviewer. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7933.879999999999s)]
*  He doesn't always get comedies, but if you read Ebert's old reviews, they're incredible. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7934.879999999999s)]
*  He's one of the best writers. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7940.12s)]
*  Did you ever read the script that he wrote? [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7941.12s)]
*  No, I never did. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7942.44s)]
*  Is it good or not? [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7943.44s)]
*  No. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7945.4s)]
*  He wrote some crazy movie. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7946.4s)]
*  What was the movie that Roger Ebert wrote? [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7947.4s)]
*  It's so insane. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7949.28s)]
*  You're like, what are you doing? [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7950.28s)]
*  What is this? [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7952.28s)]
*  It sucked. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7953.28s)]
*  I mean, I'm not the one to judge. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7954.28s)]
*  I'm not a movie critic. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7957.44s)]
*  I don't know how to interpret scripts. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7958.44s)]
*  Maybe it could have been made amazing, but most people thought it was preposterous. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7960.679999999999s)]
*  His reviews though, that was his talent, his reviews, because he would write shit. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7964.24s)]
*  And look, if you're a critic... [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7967.799999999999s)]
*  He's a really good writer. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7968.799999999999s)]
*  He would articulate things like, fuck, I didn't realize I felt that way. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7969.799999999999s)]
*  And that's what a good writer can do. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7972.92s)]
*  But he's also a different human than you. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7974.92s)]
*  Like, in Adam Sandler's movie, for me, I can review an Adam Sandler movie. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7976.92s)]
*  And I go, it's fun, silly, great, the Zo-Han, he fucks everyone, cuts hair, kicks everybody's ass. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7980.92s)]
*  It's really fun. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7986.92s)]
*  At the end of the movie, you're like, I had a good fucking time. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7987.92s)]
*  But you can like both. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7989.92s)]
*  And also, he did Uncut Gems, which is a complete polar opposite of that. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7990.92s)]
*  That movie makes my fucking hands sweat. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7995.92s)]
*  And I'm going, oh, Jesus, don't fucking do this, man. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=7998.16s)]
*  Don't fucking do this. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8001.16s)]
*  When you watch that gambling junkie keep placing those bets and you feel the anxiety, you feel it? [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8003.16s)]
*  I feel it. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8008.16s)]
*  No, it was... [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8009.16s)]
*  That's one of the most stress-inducing movies I've ever seen. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8010.16s)]
*  Ever. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8013.16s)]
*  But man, he's great in it. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8014.16s)]
*  He's so good in that movie. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8015.16s)]
*  That movie is so good. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8016.16s)]
*  They're great directors, those guys. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8017.16s)]
*  They're really good. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8018.16s)]
*  The Safdie brothers. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8019.16s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8020.16s)]
*  They did like Good Time. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8021.16s)]
*  You ever see that? [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8022.16s)]
*  They're fucking great. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8023.16s)]
*  What's Good Time? [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8024.16s)]
*  It's with Robert Pattinson. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8025.16s)]
*  It's like another crazy adrenaline rush type movie like that. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8026.4s)]
*  It's really cool. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8029.4s)]
*  Did you see Sisou? [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8030.4s)]
*  It was on TV the other day and I was loving it and I had to run out. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8032.4s)]
*  It's that war movie, right? [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8035.4s)]
*  It's fucking great. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8036.4s)]
*  Yeah, it was violent as shit. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8037.4s)]
*  It's fucking great. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8038.4s)]
*  I'm putting it on the list right now. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8039.4s)]

*  It doesn't matter. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8077.639999999999s)]
*  It's like my favorite moments of John Wick are none of him talking. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8078.639999999999s)]
*  All due respect to Keanu Reeves. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8082.639999999999s)]
*  I love that dude. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8083.639999999999s)]
*  But my favorite moments in John Wick are him just fucking everybody up. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8084.88s)]
*  It's just incredible. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8088.88s)]
*  It's like beautiful the way it's choreographed. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8089.88s)]
*  It's like beautiful violence. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8092.88s)]
*  Bro, John Wick 1, I don't care what anybody says. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8093.88s)]
*  It's like one of the best movies ever in terms of what it's trying to do. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8096.88s)]
*  What is it trying to do? [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8100.88s)]
*  It's trying to excite you and get you fired up and get you engaged and wanting this guy [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8101.88s)]
*  to be successful and kill all these bad guys. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8105.88s)]
*  And you're on his side immediately. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8107.88s)]
*  100%. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8108.88s)]
*  And he's doing things that you know can't possibly happen. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8109.88s)]
*  There's not a person who is okay with you murdering a dog. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8112.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8115.12s)]
*  You can't fucking... [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8116.12s)]
*  I mean maybe Michael Vick 10 years ago, but other than that, no. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8117.12s)]
*  And it's also redemption denied. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8120.12s)]
*  So this guy has this redemption story. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8122.12s)]
*  He's decided to settle down with this amazing woman. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8125.12s)]
*  I'm not going to be a hitman for the Russian mob anymore, which is kind of problematic [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8127.12s)]
*  already, because it's probably killed a lot of nice people, but you have beautiful hair [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8131.12s)]
*  and you are Keanu Reeves. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8134.12s)]
*  So I'm going to let it slide for now. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8135.12s)]
*  So but this woman, obviously they were really in love. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8137.12s)]
*  And then when she dies, and then they steal his car and kill his dog. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8139.36s)]
*  You don't fuck with a man's car with their dog. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8145.36s)]
*  Okay. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8147.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8148.36s)]
*  Okay. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8149.36s)]
*  And you're rooting for him every step of the way. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8150.36s)]
*  And then the fucking guy, who is the guy who played the father, the head of the Russian [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8153.36s)]
*  mob? [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8156.86s)]
*  He just passed away, that guy. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8157.86s)]
*  Great actor. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8158.86s)]
*  God damn, he was incredible. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8159.86s)]
*  He's so good in that movie, man. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8160.86s)]
*  He's so fucking good. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8162.86s)]
*  And well into the foe. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8163.86s)]
*  When he's explaining to his son what he did wrong. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8164.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8166.86s)]
*  Because he kind of, you can tell he's more like Wick. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8168.599999999999s)]
*  He's more on his side, but he's like, my fucking son. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8170.599999999999s)]
*  Well, he knows what's going to happen. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8172.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he fucked. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8174.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, when he says to him, he goes, we called him Baba Yaga. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8175.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, here play this. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8178.599999999999s)]

*  It's just not a nuanced movie. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8293.68s)]
*  It's so over the top. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8295.26s)]
*  Look, the actors are very good and it looks beautiful. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8296.66s)]
*  I think the script was like ... I've never heard of this until right now. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8299.74s)]
*  Oh, it's huge. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8302.74s)]
*  It's a huge movie. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8303.74s)]
*  Really? [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8304.74s)]
*  I'm so out of the loop, dude. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8305.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8306.74s)]
*  I didn't like it. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8307.74s)]
*  I'm out of the cultural loop. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8308.74s)]
*  Do you think you want to get into films? [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8309.74s)]
*  Is that why you're so interested? [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8311.18s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8313.18s)]
*  I wrote a movie with Noah Gardner and Schwarzenester Steinberg. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8314.68s)]
*  It's like a drinking buddies movie. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8318.36s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8319.76s)]
*  It's really funny. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8320.76s)]
*  Hopefully we do some with that. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8321.76s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to develop a TV show right now. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8322.76s)]
*  I like writing. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8325.720000000001s)]

*  I worked on one for a while with Dana Gould. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8331.12s)]
*  We worked on an animated show for so fucking long and we couldn't sell it, but I loved [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8333.24s)]
*  it. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8337.960000000001s)]
*  I will make it someday. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8338.960000000001s)]
*  I think this show I'm working on, I'm writing it with ... Do you know Mike Lawrence, the [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8341.16s)]
*  comedian? [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8344.9s)]

*  I mean, I do know him. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8347.9s)]
*  He was a roast battle champion back in the day. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8349.58s)]
*  He's a great standup too, but we're creating this show and I think it's going to be really [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8353.1s)]
*  cool. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8357.42s)]
*  Yeah, I love movies. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8358.42s)]
*  Pull up Mike Lawrence. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8359.42s)]
*  I love standup the most and that'll always be number one, but I want to try other avenues. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8360.42s)]
*  You should. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8366.1s)]

*  Dude, okay. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8396.4s)]
*  Imagine what that was like back then. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8397.4s)]
*  Can I give you a book recommendation? [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8398.4s)]
*  I think it's called, look up the title exactly. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8400.26s)]
*  It's called Lunches with Orson, I think. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8401.66s)]
*  It's about Orson Welles. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8403.42s)]
*  It's literally Orson Welles shit talking every actor and director from the 30s to like the [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8404.619999999999s)]
*  80s. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8410.9s)]
*  It's one of the funniest, but he's incredibly funny. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8411.9s)]
*  Oh, he was brilliant. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8414.5s)]
*  Because he, I mean, yeah, this is it. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8415.5s)]
*  He underperformed. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8416.5s)]
*  It's brilliant. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8417.5s)]
*  I mean, he underperformed in his life. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8418.5s)]
*  But think about making Citizen Kane at 25. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8419.5s)]
*  I know, but he underperformed. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8421.3s)]
*  But that had always drove me crazy. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8423.18s)]
*  Like why? [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8425.3s)]
*  Why did he go to sell wine after that? [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8426.3s)]
*  He was broke. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8428.4s)]
*  I understand that. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8429.4s)]
*  I'm not criticizing him for selling wine. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8430.4s)]
*  I would do it too. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8432.4s)]
*  My criticism is like, you were the fucking man. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8433.4s)]
*  You were war of worlds. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8437.4s)]
*  You played that on the radio and freaked out half the country. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8439.4s)]
*  You were Citizen Kane. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8442.4s)]
*  He was going up against William Randolph Hearst. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8444.4s)]
*  I mean, he was essentially making a film that was about William Randolph Hearst. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8447.4s)]
*  William Randolph Hearst was very aware of it. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8453.4s)]
*  So was everyone else. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8455.4s)]
*  Scary, powerful. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8456.4s)]
*  It's so scary that marijuana is still a schedule one drug today. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8457.4s)]
*  Because of William Randolph Hearst. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8460.4s)]
*  That's a fact. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8461.4s)]
*  That's a fact. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8462.4s)]
*  William Randolph Hearst with Hearst Publications. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8463.4s)]
*  They started printing. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8466.4s)]
*  They're the ones that came up with this whole idea, along with Harry Anslinger, that marijuana [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8467.9s)]
*  was a different drug. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8472.9s)]
*  Because they were using hemp for everything. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8473.9s)]
*  They were using hemp for clothes. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8476.9s)]
*  Hemp makes a superior fabric. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8478.9s)]
*  It makes superior paper. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8481.9s)]
*  It's way better for paper. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8483.4s)]
*  It's way more sustainable. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8484.9s)]
*  You could repopulate. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8486.4s)]
*  If you have land and you're growing hemp on it and you cut it all down, you grow it back [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8487.4s)]
*  in a year. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8492.4s)]
*  If you have land where you're growing trees and you chop them down to make paper, you're [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8493.4s)]
*  fucked for 20, 30 years, man. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8497.4s)]
*  So different thing you're doing. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8499.4s)]
*  And it's far superior. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8502.4s)]
*  But for years, they had used paper. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8504.4s)]
*  Because there was a machine that came out called the decorticator. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8507.4s)]
*  And when this machine came out, it could effectively process hemp fiber with a machine. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8510.4s)]
*  Because they used to use slaves. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8515.9s)]
*  So when they used slaves, it wasn't as cost effective as cotton was. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8517.9s)]
*  So then they started cotton picking. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8521.9s)]
*  Eli Whitney comes out with the cotton gin. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8522.9s)]
*  And then hemp gets kind of put on the barn burner, back burner rather, because it's not [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8525.9s)]
*  as easy to do. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8529.9s)]
*  You've got to beat the fuck out of that stalk to break it down into fibers and weave those [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8530.9s)]
*  fibers. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8534.9s)]
*  But if you do, it's way superior. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8535.9s)]
*  So this invention comes out called the decorticator. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8537.9s)]
*  Pull up a decorticator so you can see what it is. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8540.9s)]
*  So it's this big steel wheel with these like rods poking out, these pokey points poking [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8543.4s)]
*  out. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8549.4s)]
*  And they grind down the hemp fiber with this so that you can make superior paper. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8550.4s)]
*  And it's a machine that does this. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8554.4s)]
*  So popular mechanics or popular science, on the front cover says, hemp the new billion [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8556.4s)]
*  dollar crop. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8561.4s)]
*  So there's a competition with these people that have paper mills. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8562.4s)]
*  So William Randolph Hearst not only has Hearst publications, he also has paper mills. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8565.4s)]
*  And he has huge forests that he's chopping down to make paper for his newspaper. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8570.9s)]
*  So instead of like switching everything over to hemp, he decides to demonize hemp. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8575.9s)]
*  So he creates a new name. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8580.9s)]
*  They create a new drug called marijuana. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8582.9s)]
*  And marijuana was the name they used to use for a wild Mexican tobacco. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8585.9s)]
*  And so they attribute this marijuana name to cannabis, which they've always used, because [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8590.9s)]
*  it's hemp. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8595.9s)]
*  It's the same thing that they've always used for clothing. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8596.9s)]
*  But he villainized it. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8598.9s)]
*  So they came out with Reefer Madness and those crazy propaganda movies. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8600.4s)]
*  It makes you shoot up a school. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8604.4s)]
*  They started writing stories in Hearst publications about blacks and Mexicans who are taking this [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8605.4s)]
*  marijuana and raping white women. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8611.199999999999s)]
*  So they put everybody into a fucking fever pitch and then they outlawed it. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8613.4s)]
*  Wow. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8618.4s)]
*  That is fucking nutty. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8619.4s)]
*  It's 2024 and it's still schedule one. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8620.4s)]
*  That is crazy. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8624.4s)]
*  I did not know that was Hearst. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8625.4s)]
*  That's William Randolph Hearst. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8626.4s)]
*  So that's the guy that Orson Welles was up against. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8627.9s)]
*  Incredible. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8629.9s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8630.9s)]
*  Dude, I highly recommend it. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8631.9s)]
*  The amount of shit talking, everybody gets... [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8633.9s)]
*  It's basically a podcast but in text. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8636.9s)]
*  Richard Burden will walk up to him at an interview and he's like, can't you see I'm talking to [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8640.9s)]
*  someone else? [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8644.9s)]
*  He's like a psycho. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8645.9s)]
*  But there's one part where this guy Henry Jaglum worships Orson Welles. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8646.9s)]
*  He's like, he's my hero. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8650.9s)]
*  He's a genius. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8651.9s)]
*  So I guess he knew Peter Bogdanovich and he goes, how about setting me up with him? [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8653.4s)]
*  I wrote a movie part that would be killer for him. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8657.9s)]
*  He's like, he's never going to do it but if you want to meet him, he's staying at this [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8659.4s)]
*  hotel in New York. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8662.4s)]
*  So he's like a fucking dude. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8663.4s)]
*  Every time he's at dinner, he's got an eating problem. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8665.4s)]
*  So I'll have one bite of this and then he goes back to his room and orders six ribeyes [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8667.4s)]
*  and fucking gorgeous. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8670.4s)]
*  But this guy goes to meet him and he's like literally knocking on his hotel room door [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8672.4s)]
*  to be in his movie. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8676.4s)]
*  And there's a guy who's interviewing him in the book. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8677.4s)]
*  They became buddies. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8679.4s)]
*  He knocks on his door and he goes, please be in my movie. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8680.9s)]
*  He goes, I'll never do a director's first film. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8683.9s)]
*  Fuck you, I'll never do it. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8685.9s)]
*  He goes, you acted in your first film. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8686.9s)]
*  He goes, no I won't do it. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8688.9s)]
*  He goes, you love magic. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8690.9s)]
*  Please, please do this. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8691.9s)]
*  I know you're an amateur magician. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8693.9s)]
*  He goes, never. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8695.9s)]
*  And then he pauses and he's like, in this film could I wear a cape? [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8696.9s)]
*  And he's like, yeah. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8699.9s)]
*  And he's like, alright I'll do it. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8700.9s)]
*  That's all it took. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8701.9s)]
*  He's a fucking weird dude. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8702.9s)]
*  But he, the amount of people he shit talks in the book where he's like, fuck. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8704.9s)]
*  He's like, fuck Woody Allen. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8709.9s)]
*  And he'll just go on like a, but it's like everything he says, like I love Woody Allen. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8710.9s)]
*  But everything he says I'm like, it's pretty fucking funny. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8714.9s)]
*  What was he saying about Woody Allen? [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8717.4s)]
*  You know that his type of self-deprecation is insincere and he can tell he loves himself. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8718.9s)]
*  He's like, I don't buy it. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8723.4s)]
*  I think this guy loves himself. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8724.9s)]
*  And like, he's like, anyone who's this, who's this self-deprecating, it's fucking bullshit. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8726.4s)]
*  He loves himself the way he acts out himself. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8731.4s)]
*  A lot of stuff like that. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8734.4s)]
*  He'll shit on like. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8735.4s)]
*  Ooh, I like it. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8736.4s)]
*  Not only was he skeptical of Allen's approach to comedy, but he was vehemently averse to the hungry ego it served. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8737.9s)]
*  I hate Woody Allen physically. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8744.4s)]
*  I dislike that kind of man. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8746.4s)]
*  He said, adding, oh yes, I can hardly bear to talk to him. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8748.4s)]
*  He has the Chaplin disease. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8752.4s)]
*  Oh don't, don't say this about Chaplin. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8754.4s)]
*  Well you know, a lot of people, I love Fatty Arbuckle. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8757.4s)]
*  There's a book about Fatty Arbuckle who fucking hated Chaplin. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8759.4s)]
*  I think they ended up alright, but they were like, he was like Team Buster Keaton. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8761.9s)]
*  I don't know if you want to get on Team Fatty Arbuckle. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8765.4s)]
*  Really? He didn't do it. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8767.4s)]
*  He didn't do it? [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8768.4s)]
*  He didn't do it. That's bullshit. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8769.4s)]
*  Really? Is it bullshit? [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8770.4s)]
*  He was framed. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8771.4s)]
*  Great book called Frame Up. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8772.4s)]
*  I don't know exactly who framed him. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8774.4s)]
*  How much of your life savings would you bet on this? [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8775.4s)]
*  He was exonerated. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8777.4s)]
*  Was he? [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8778.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8779.4s)]
*  Oh he was. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8780.4s)]
*  Yeah, but that's the fucked up thing, is we're talking about it as if he did it. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8781.4s)]
*  Oh, and this was 1930 what? [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8783.4s)]
*  Yeah, and you know what the fucked up part is? [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8785.4s)]
*  He had to do like four trials to get properly exonerated. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8786.4s)]
*  So he ate up his life, and he died like a year later from a heart attack. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8789.4s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8792.4s)]
*  But no, he was, dude. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8793.4s)]
*  And his career was ruined. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8794.4s)]
*  He created the pie throw. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8795.4s)]
*  Think about how fucking crazy that is. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8797.4s)]
*  Fatty Arbuckle invented the pie throw in the face. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8798.4s)]
*  So what was wrong with Chaplin? [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8801.4s)]
*  I think they thought he was... [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8803.4s)]
*  Is Chaplin like Michael Jordan? [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8804.4s)]
*  No, I think... [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8806.4s)]
*  But seriously. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8807.4s)]
*  No, I think... [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8808.4s)]
*  If you think about like you're that guy back then, you're the comedy guy, you're the fucking king of comedy. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8809.4s)]
*  I don't know, I think he... [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8814.4s)]
*  I think obviously a genius, but I think also like think of the circles. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8817.4s)]
*  He rolled with like Einstein. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8821.4s)]
*  Right, but that's what I'm saying. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8823.4s)]
*  Remember that speech that he gave in that movie? [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8824.4s)]
*  What was it, The Dictator? [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8826.4s)]
*  What was that movie? [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8827.4s)]
*  I think... [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8828.4s)]
*  I don't know his movies that well, but they're playing it every night at The Cellars. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8829.4s)]
*  I know him silently. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8832.4s)]
*  There's a speech that he gave that is relevant today. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8833.4s)]
*  Like this speech about humanity. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8838.4s)]
*  You know, do you remember that? [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8842.4s)]
*  I don't. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8844.4s)]
*  It's brilliant. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8845.4s)]
*  It's been a while since I've watched his stuff. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8846.4s)]
*  I mean, I was more into Buster Keaton personally. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8847.4s)]
*  Well, Buster Keaton was amazing. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8850.4s)]
*  The stunts that that guy did, holy shit, man. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8852.4s)]
*  Broke his fucking neck. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8855.4s)]
*  Broke his everything. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8856.4s)]
*  He broke everything, dude. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8857.4s)]
*  That guy was doing wild shit. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8858.4s)]
*  He was falling off buildings, going through awnings, like legitimately going through awnings. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8860.4s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8865.4s)]
*  See if you can find that Charlie Chaplin speech. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8866.4s)]
*  I want to get to Buster Keaton, but there's a speech that he did. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8867.4s)]
*  Do you know what I'm talking about, Jamie? [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8871.4s)]
*  I think this is it. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8873.4s)]
*  Let me see what it looks like. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8874.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8875.4s)]
*  Let me hear this. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8876.4s)]
*  So he's got the Hitler mustache. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8878.4s)]
*  He looks like Hitler. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8880.4s)]
*  I think they've added the Hans Zimmer inception music to this. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8881.4s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8883.4s)]
*  It's going to make it a little more dramatic. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8884.4s)]
*  That's not my business. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8886.4s)]
*  I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8888.4s)]
*  Do you want me to keep the music? [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8891.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8892.4s)]
*  No, unless you can find one that doesn't have music. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8893.4s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like this is going to make it different. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8895.4s)]
*  Yeah, it definitely does. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8896.4s)]
*  Yeah, Fatty Arbuckle was definitely framed, though. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8897.4s)]
*  And he... [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8899.4s)]
*  Here it is. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8900.4s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8901.4s)]
*  Fatty, we got your back from beyond the grave. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8903.4s)]
*  All I have to say is fuck Fatty Arbuckle. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8907.4s)]
*  All I have to say is not a lot of laughs per minute on that speech. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8910.4s)]
*  That's a good point. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8913.4s)]
*  I don't think that was a comedy. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8914.4s)]
*  No, no, it wasn't. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8915.4s)]
*  But it wasn't. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8916.4s)]
*  What was the movie? [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8917.4s)]
*  The Great Dictator? [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8918.4s)]
*  The Great Dictator? [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8920.4s)]
*  What was the movie about? [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8921.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8922.4s)]
*  But that was pretty fucking good. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8923.4s)]
*  It was good. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8925.4s)]
*  And applicable today. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8926.4s)]
*  It gives you... [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8927.4s)]
*  It actually makes me sad sometimes. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8928.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean about machines. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8930.4s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8931.4s)]
*  But also it's so obvious. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8932.4s)]
*  They saw the writing on the wall. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8934.4s)]
*  So did Ted Kaczynski, by the way. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8937.4s)]
*  Yeah, he made a lot of good points when you take out the murder. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8939.4s)]
*  He did. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8941.4s)]
*  You take out all the bombings. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8942.4s)]
*  He was saying the technology was going to replace us. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8944.4s)]
*  He's right. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8946.4s)]
*  That's the worst part when these monsters are like, man, but he obviously was a bright mind. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8947.4s)]
*  That was a satire? [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8950.4s)]
*  It says, 1940 American anti-war political satire, black comedy. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8952.4s)]
*  Black comedy. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8956.4s)]
*  Written, directed, produced, scored by, and starring Charlie Chaplin. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8957.4s)]
*  Following the tradition of many of his other films. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8962.4s)]
*  Wow, he did everything, man. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8964.4s)]
*  Of course he was a dick. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8966.4s)]
*  If you're doing all those things, you're Steve Jobs, but you're doing it in a movie. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8968.4s)]
*  It's the same kind of animal. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8971.4s)]
*  I don't know, man, I like Louis. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8973.4s)]
*  Yeah, but he's different. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8974.4s)]
*  Louis did everything on Louis. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8975.4s)]
*  I'm not saying that it's impossible to be a cool person and also be all those things. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8978.4s)]
*  It's just harder to do. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8983.4s)]
*  I get it. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8985.4s)]
*  I feel like guys like that probably don't have Charlie Chaplin as friends either. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8987.4s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8991.4s)]
*  Which I think is one of the critical things about our occupation. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8992.4s)]
*  Is that we're constantly surrounded by people like us. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8995.4s)]
*  We're all very like-minded animals. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=8999.4s)]
*  We have an appreciation for each other that is very different than most occupations. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9002.4s)]
*  I have a reverence for elite professional comedians. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9007.4s)]
*  I'll do anything for you. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9012.4s)]
*  Me too. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9013.4s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9014.4s)]
*  I feel like we're all in a very sacred tribe. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9015.4s)]
*  I always say there's probably a thousand of us on planet Earth. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9017.4s)]
*  If we're really being kind and generous and giving people a great amount of curve. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9021.4s)]
*  The reality is it's probably about 250 that I would want to hang out with. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9027.4s)]
*  That I would say are legit. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9032.4s)]
*  It's fortunate that we get to be part of this fraternity of comics who are just very cool. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9034.4s)]
*  Luckily, most of the people that I've wanted to meet have always ended up being pretty cool. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9043.4s)]
*  There's exceptions. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9049.4s)]
*  The exceptions I think existed in the TV world. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9052.4s)]
*  Honestly, the exceptions that I encountered, I don't want to throw anybody under the bus, [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9055.4s)]
*  but there's some people that I like now that in 2001 I wanted to smack. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9059.4s)]
*  There were some people that were really rude and shitty. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9065.4s)]
*  There was the culture of being rude and shitty that was almost encouraged. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9068.4s)]
*  When Phil Hartman came over to News Radio from Saturday Night Live, [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9072.4s)]
*  he had this very bizarre kind of anticipation of hostility from other cast members. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9076.4s)]
*  He was very highly paid. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9083.4s)]
*  I wasn't famous at all when I was on News Radio. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9086.4s)]
*  I was a nobody. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9090.4s)]
*  I had been on one show called Hardball that was on Fox that bombed. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9092.4s)]
*  It aired six episodes and I was the star of the show. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9096.4s)]
*  That show got canceled. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9099.4s)]
*  I got a development deal with NBC. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9101.4s)]
*  Dude, I had never taken acting lessons. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9103.4s)]
*  I had to get an acting coach. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9106.4s)]
*  I was all of a sudden sitting next to Phil Hartman and I was 27. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9109.4s)]
*  He's brilliant. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9113.4s)]
*  Yeah, he's brilliant. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9114.4s)]
*  I had never even thought about being an actor. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9115.4s)]
*  They just gave me money. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9117.4s)]
*  They said, do you want to act? [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9119.4s)]
*  I'm like, what do I have to do to pretend? [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9120.4s)]
*  I had no experience acting at all. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9123.4s)]
*  I did that show. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9125.4s)]
*  Phil Hartman had this distrust of all the other people in the cast. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9127.4s)]
*  He had this real arm's length thing. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9131.4s)]
*  I was always like, dude, you're Phil Hartman. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9134.4s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9137.4s)]
*  You're the man. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9138.4s)]
*  Why do you think that was? [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9139.4s)]
*  Saturday Night Live. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9140.4s)]
*  He told me. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9141.4s)]
*  Oh, they're trying to take your throats. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9142.4s)]
*  Yes, dude. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9143.4s)]
*  They were cut throat. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9144.4s)]
*  The pressure of that show. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9146.4s)]
*  Weird back stabby ways. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9148.4s)]
*  They would get your assistant fired. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9149.4s)]
*  They would do weird shit. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9151.4s)]
*  You were too close to one of the PAs. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9152.4s)]
*  Fuck him. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9154.4s)]
*  Get him out of here. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9155.4s)]
*  One of the other cast members would turn on one of the PAs that you had become friendly with. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9156.4s)]
*  I've heard it's tough. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9160.4s)]
*  They were screaming at each other in the hallway. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9161.4s)]
*  Fuck you. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9163.4s)]
*  Stealing each other's jokes. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9164.4s)]
*  It was creepy. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9165.4s)]
*  It was creepy. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9167.4s)]
*  Phil and I became friends. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9168.4s)]
*  As we became friends, especially after the first season. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9170.4s)]
*  The first season was really long hours. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9172.4s)]
*  They were trying to work out the show. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9175.4s)]
*  We were hanging out 15, 16 hours a day. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9177.4s)]
*  We were on the set all the time. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9181.4s)]
*  We got to become friends. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9183.4s)]
*  Then he just sort of loosened up and explained. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9184.4s)]
*  It's like a cut throat environment over there. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9186.4s)]
*  What a bummer that's what that does to you. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9188.4s)]
*  I have obviously a great appreciation for Phil Hartman. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9191.4s)]
*  I thought that was a great show. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9194.4s)]
*  I mean, shit, I watched Jingle All the Way on the holidays. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9196.4s)]
*  I fucking loved that movie. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9201.4s)]
*  Arnold and Sinbad. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9202.4s)]
*  He was a great dude, man. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9203.4s)]
*  He's a great, great comic actor. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9205.4s)]
*  He was a funny dude, too. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9207.4s)]
*  He would do stand-up. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9209.4s)]
*  He would do warm-ups for the crowd. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9210.4s)]
*  Just fucking around. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9212.4s)]
*  He had an amazing Bill Clinton impression. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9213.4s)]
*  He was thinking about doing stand-up. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9216.4s)]
*  He just had a terrible marriage. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9219.4s)]
*  Poor guy. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9222.4s)]
*  Terrible, terrible. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9223.4s)]
*  I was the one guy on the show that was like, [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9225.4s)]
*  get the fuck out right now. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9230.4s)]
*  You were like, be honest with her. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9233.4s)]
*  Tell her what you did, [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9234.4s)]
*  and I'm sure she'll take it very well. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9235.4s)]
*  No, it wasn't even that. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9236.4s)]
*  It was the opposite. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9237.4s)]
*  It was just get away. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9238.4s)]
*  I know, I'm fucking around. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9239.4s)]
*  She would insult him at parties and stuff publicly. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9240.4s)]
*  It was gross. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9245.4s)]
*  It was scary. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9246.4s)]
*  Sometimes the people are together, [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9247.4s)]
*  and they fucking hate each other, [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9249.4s)]
*  but they, for whatever reason, [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9251.4s)]
*  do not leave each other. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9253.4s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9255.4s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9257.4s)]
*  I don't understand it, [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9258.4s)]
*  but some people, they just stuck in a pattern. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9260.4s)]
*  Sometimes they don't see quite how bad it is. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9262.4s)]
*  Even when your friends point it out, [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9265.4s)]
*  you don't really see it [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9266.4s)]
*  until you get some distance from that relationship. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9267.4s)]
*  It's also you learn from your parents [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9269.4s)]
*  and if you come from parents [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9272.4s)]
*  that beat the shit out of each other [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9274.4s)]
*  or scream at each other, [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9276.4s)]
*  throw things at each other, [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9277.4s)]
*  you get accustomed to thinking [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9278.4s)]
*  that's how relationships work, [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9280.4s)]
*  how they function. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9282.4s)]
*  It's real sketchy. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9284.4s)]
*  Bad parenting is so fucking... [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9286.4s)]
*  I was going to tell you about Fatty Arbuckle. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9288.4s)]
*  His dad walked out. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9290.4s)]
*  I'm sorry, I don't want to interrupt this part, [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9293.4s)]
*  but I need to know, we should clarify, [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9296.4s)]
*  what did Fatty do? [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9300.4s)]
*  He was accused of raping and murdering a woman. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9302.4s)]
*  He didn't do it. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9304.4s)]
*  Murdering? [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9305.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9306.4s)]
*  Wasn't it like a bottle broke inside of her? [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9307.4s)]
*  Yeah, that was the fake thing. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9309.4s)]
*  I forgot the exact... [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9311.4s)]
*  I read this years ago, but it's... [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9312.4s)]
*  What was it, Jamie? [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9314.4s)]
*  So how did she get murdered? [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9315.4s)]
*  It was a frame up. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9319.4s)]
*  I don't know who framed him, [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9320.4s)]
*  but someone framed him up. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9321.4s)]
*  What was the reason for framing him? [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9323.4s)]
*  I don't remember, [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9325.4s)]
*  because I read this years ago, [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9326.4s)]
*  but he is innocent, [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9327.4s)]
*  and he was exonerated. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9329.4s)]
*  But if we could find it, that'd be awesome. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9331.4s)]
*  I'm reading an article about it right now. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9333.4s)]
*  It's hard to find the actual answer. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9335.4s)]
*  But he was a dude who his dad fucked him up, [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9337.4s)]
*  because his dad walked out on the family, [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9339.4s)]
*  and I think the mother was mental. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9341.4s)]
*  But he was supposed to be raised by his father, [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9343.4s)]
*  so his dad owned a hotel, [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9346.4s)]
*  and they would take a train to the hotel where your dad is. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9348.4s)]
*  So his dad hears that he's fucking coming, [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9353.4s)]
*  and he sold the hotel and disappeared. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9355.4s)]
*  So then he just shows up, and he's like a fat kid, [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9357.4s)]
*  like 13, he's like, what do I do? [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9360.4s)]
*  And they're like, we can give you a job here. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9362.4s)]
*  So he started working at the hotel at like 13. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9364.4s)]
*  And then he finds out he's good [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9366.4s)]
*  by joining the talent show, [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9368.4s)]
*  and they're like, this guy's got an incredible voice. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9370.4s)]
*  And then he was being silly and funny. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9373.4s)]
*  They're like, this guy's kind of a genius. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9375.4s)]
*  He starts becoming an incredible touring performer, [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9377.4s)]
*  and of course the dad wants back in. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9380.4s)]
*  Oh, God. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9382.4s)]
*  Of course. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9383.4s)]
*  Classic. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9384.4s)]
*  But it's like, but yeah, I remember being like, [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9385.4s)]
*  his wife, who he was divorced from, [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9388.4s)]
*  was like, he's fucking innocent. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9390.4s)]
*  They divorced on not amazing terms, [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9392.4s)]
*  and she's like, he didn't do shit. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9394.4s)]
*  So what did they frame him for? [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9396.4s)]
*  Was he becoming too big of a star? [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9398.4s)]
*  I was trying to read through this. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9400.4s)]
*  It's explaining the entire story in the Smithsonian article about it. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9402.4s)]
*  And it's like, it's a long, [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9405.4s)]
*  I'm sorry for bringing this up if I don't fully have a grasp on this. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9407.4s)]
*  No, it's okay. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9410.4s)]
*  But it was a brief. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9411.4s)]
*  It happens every day. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9412.4s)]
*  It's the first in my life. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9413.4s)]
*  Okay. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9416.4s)]
*  There's a party. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9417.4s)]
*  Where should we start here? [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9418.4s)]
*  Just right up here. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9420.4s)]
*  Okay. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9421.4s)]
*  According to Arbuckle, [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9422.4s)]
*  Fischbach arranged everything from the rooms to the guests to the liquor, [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9423.4s)]
*  despite prohibition. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9427.4s)]
*  And on Labor Day, September 5th, 1921, [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9428.4s)]
*  Arbuckle awoke to find that he had many uninvited guests. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9433.4s)]
*  He was still walking around in his pajamas, bathrobe, and slippers, [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9436.4s)]
*  when he saw Delmont and Rap and expressed concern that their reputations might [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9439.4s)]
*  alert police to the gin party. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9444.4s)]
*  In Los Angeles, Delmont was known as a madam and blackmailer. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9447.4s)]
*  Rap had made something of a name for herself as a model, [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9451.4s)]
*  clothing designer, aspiring actress, and party girl. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9457.4s)]
*  Oh, just a regular LA under 30 woman. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9460.4s)]
*  But the food and booze were flowing by then. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9463.4s)]
*  The music was playing. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9466.4s)]
*  And Arbuckle was soon no longer focused on his exhausting work schedule, [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9468.4s)]
*  the burns on his backside, or just who all the guests were. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9472.4s)]
*  What happened in the ensuing hours would play out on the front pages of William Randolph Hearst. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9477.4s)]
*  There you go again, that motherfucker. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9482.4s)]
*  National chain of newspapers in lurid headlines before Arbuckle had a chance to tell his side of the story. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9483.4s)]
*  Virginia Rap was 25 years old when she arrived at the St. Francis Hospital in San Francisco [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9489.4s)]
*  for a Labor Day weekend party. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9494.4s)]
*  Hotel, excuse me, did I say hospital? [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9496.4s)]
*  St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco for a Labor Day weekend party. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9499.4s)]
*  Maude Delmont soon painted a sinister portrait of the happy-go-lucky Portly Prince of silent film. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9502.4s)]
*  This is what she told police. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9510.4s)]
*  After Arbuckle and Rap had a few drinks together, [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9512.4s)]
*  he pulled her actress into an adjoining room saying, [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9515.4s)]
*  I've waited for you five years and now I've got you. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9519.4s)]
*  After a half hour or so, Delmont heard Rap screaming, [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9523.4s)]
*  so she knocked on and then kicked at the locked door. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9527.4s)]
*  After a delay, Arbuckle came to the door in his pajamas, [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9530.4s)]
*  wearing Rap's hat, cocked at an angle, and smiling, his foolish screen smile. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9533.4s)]
*  Behind him, Rap was sprawled on the bed, moaning. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9539.4s)]
*  Arbuckle did it, the actress said, according to Delmont. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9543.4s)]
*  Rap was taken to another room, a doctor was summoned, and he attended to her. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9546.4s)]
*  This might take forever for me to read this thing. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9550.4s)]
*  This was it, she died, that's why I was living it there. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9553.4s)]
*  She died September 9th of a ruptured bladder. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9556.4s)]
*  So what actually happened though? [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9559.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9562.4s)]
*  Then it went to the newspapers and then he turned himself in. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9563.4s)]
*  And that's where I was like, I think this is getting way too long. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9566.4s)]
*  Right, but like, what was the actual story? [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9569.4s)]
*  That's right, I don't know. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9572.4s)]
*  So he's charged with manslaughter. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9573.4s)]
*  We have Roscoe Arbuckle in a hole here trying to get some, [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9574.4s)]
*  I think they were trying to blackmail him. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9576.4s)]
*  Hmm, we have, okay hold on a second. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9578.4s)]
*  There's the matter of the telegrams that she sent to attorneys [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9580.4s)]
*  in both San Diego and Los Angeles. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9584.4s)]
*  We have Roscoe Arbuckle in a hole here, chance to make some money out of him. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9586.4s)]
*  Oh, babe. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9591.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9593.4s)]
*  Oh, okay, they were trying to railroad him. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9594.4s)]
*  He was making a million a year in 21, that's a lot of chatter. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9596.4s)]
*  Oh! [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9598.4s)]
*  What was that? [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9599.4s)]
*  Yeah, so they were trying to fuck him. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9600.4s)]
*  A million a year in 1921? [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9601.4s)]
*  What was that money? [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9603.4s)]
*  What's that today? [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9604.4s)]
*  That's got to be like... [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9605.4s)]
*  Let's guess. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9606.4s)]
*  25, 20? [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9607.4s)]
*  The doctor who treated Rap about at the hotel testified [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9608.4s)]
*  she had told him Arbuckle did not try to sexually assault her, [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9612.4s)]
*  but the prosecutor got the point dismissed as hearsay. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9615.4s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9618.4s)]
*  There we go. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9619.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9620.4s)]
*  I forgot the specifics. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9621.4s)]
*  So what happened to her? [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9622.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9623.4s)]
*  Her bladder rupture? [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9624.4s)]
*  No marks of violence on the body, no signs of the girl being attacked in any way. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9625.4s)]
*  Oh, so she might have just had like... [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9629.4s)]
*  She said she had a chronic bladder condition, according to this. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9631.4s)]
*  Oh, so she might have just died. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9633.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9635.4s)]
*  Fetty Arbuckle was making a million dollars. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9636.4s)]
*  Before we go any further, let's find out what a million dollars... [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9638.4s)]
*  I'm guessing at least 20. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9641.4s)]
*  I'm going to guess more. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9642.4s)]
*  Maybe 25, 30? [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9643.4s)]
*  I say 50 million. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9644.4s)]
*  Really? [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9645.4s)]
*  Maybe, yeah. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9646.4s)]
*  A million dollars in 1921 and in 2024 money? [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9647.4s)]
*  You're probably right. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9650.4s)]
*  I say it's 50 million, because inflation is stupid. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9651.4s)]
*  It says it's about 15.8 million. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9656.4s)]
*  That's it? [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9659.4s)]
*  Damn. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9660.4s)]
*  Damn. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9661.4s)]
*  We're both off. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9662.4s)]
*  So he was just only minor balling. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9663.4s)]
*  For a while, yeah. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9665.4s)]
*  He was probably just balling way harder than him. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9666.4s)]
*  After the Depression, his money would have went down and then it started going back up. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9667.4s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9670.4s)]
*  From the Depression? [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9671.4s)]
*  Yeah, after the 30s, that million he had in 1921 would have only been worth 750K. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9672.4s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9677.4s)]
*  1932, so 10 years later, if he just let it sit, I guess. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9678.4s)]
*  Then it went up. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9682.4s)]
*  He was a party animal, but he wasn't a rapist. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9683.4s)]
*  Or a murderer. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9685.4s)]
*  No. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9686.4s)]
*  So she just had a disease. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9687.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9688.4s)]
*  And she died of that disease and they just had him for money. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9689.4s)]
*  Wow. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9691.4s)]
*  Dark shit. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9692.4s)]
*  It's a book called Frame Up. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9693.4s)]
*  It's really good. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9694.4s)]
*  It's hard to find. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9695.4s)]
*  He was acquitted the first trial and then they tried to get him again. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9696.4s)]
*  Jerry deadlocked. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9699.4s)]
*  Third trial, our buckle was allowed to call witnesses for the first time. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9701.4s)]
*  Wow. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9705.4s)]
*  So he got off and he made a comeback, but he died like a year after. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9706.4s)]
*  The Charlie Chaplin thing and that thing makes me say it's always been fucked. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9710.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9714.4s)]
*  I mean, it's almost kind of always been fucked. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9715.4s)]
*  This is the best time for comedians, dude, because it's not as, at least with comics, [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9716.4s)]
*  it's like more, as you said, it's more fraternal. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9722.4s)]
*  I mean, we're kind of all cool and there's so much room now. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9724.4s)]
*  There's so much room. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9728.4s)]
*  There were like two of them back then, dude. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9729.4s)]
*  The people that are complaining about other comics now, it's like, listen, figure it out. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9731.4s)]
*  Figure out your own shit. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9735.4s)]
*  Figure it out. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9736.4s)]
*  Stop complaining about other comics. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9737.4s)]
*  Twitter's not your journal. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9738.4s)]
*  Chill the fuck out. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9739.4s)]
*  And neither is Instagram. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9740.4s)]
*  Stop. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9741.4s)]
*  Stop being stupid. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9742.4s)]
*  Just make it funny if you're going to do that shit. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9743.4s)]
*  Just be better than what you are. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9745.4s)]
*  Figure it out. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9747.4s)]
*  Or don't. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9748.4s)]
*  Or stop doing it. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9749.4s)]
*  Sell shoes. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9750.4s)]
*  I remember, Atel said that to me once, I was complaining years ago, and he goes, maybe [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9751.4s)]
*  he said to someone else actually, but he goes, get funnier. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9753.4s)]
*  I like how he said it was at you and then it was like, no, I'm not that stupid. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9756.4s)]
*  I remember it was someone else, but I don't want to use his name because he's a great [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9759.4s)]
*  comic, so I don't want to put it on him, but he didn't mean it like you're not funny. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9761.4s)]
*  He meant it like, well, you better get funnier. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9765.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9767.4s)]
*  Because what else can you do? [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9768.4s)]
*  There's nothing else you can do. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9769.4s)]
*  That's in your control. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9770.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9771.4s)]
*  Try to be fucking funny. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9772.4s)]
*  And all the other things that are out of your control, the more attention that you spend [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9773.4s)]
*  on them, the less attention you will have towards the thing that you can control. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9776.4s)]
*  It's that simple. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9780.4s)]
*  It's like an allocation of resources issue. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9781.4s)]
*  You can't allocate resources to things that are completely unproductive and in fact counterproductive. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9783.4s)]
*  They fuck with you psychologically. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9788.4s)]
*  You get up in the middle of the night, you go to pee, you think about it, you're like, [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9790.4s)]
*  fuck, and then you can't go back to sleep. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9793.4s)]
*  You grind your teeth, and now you have to get a fucking dental procedure. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9795.4s)]
*  It's not good, man. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9797.4s)]
*  Don't be involved in unnecessary conflict. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9798.4s)]
*  It's just not good for you. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9801.4s)]
*  It's not good for anybody. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9802.4s)]
*  It's not good for that person. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9803.4s)]
*  It's not good for you. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9804.4s)]
*  It's not good for the people that you're going to encounter after the conflict. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9805.4s)]
*  It's not good for the people they encounter after the conflict. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9808.4s)]
*  There's a butterfly effect that happens with stuff like that. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9810.4s)]
*  It's pointless. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9813.4s)]
*  And the business is going to keep changing. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9814.4s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9815.4s)]
*  It's like, this is not what it was 20 years ago. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9816.4s)]
*  In 10 years, it's going to be different. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9818.4s)]
*  Like, think about how big, I think about this all the time, Comedy Central was the fucking king. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9820.4s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9824.4s)]
*  They're useless now. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9825.4s)]
*  They're useless. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9826.4s)]
*  It's also, what's happening now is like a very organic merging of like, you know, for a lack of a better word, artists. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9827.4s)]
*  Because we are artists, but we're artists. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9837.4s)]
*  It's like, calling a comic an artist, it's almost like, for us, it's like, shut the fuck up. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9839.4s)]
*  It's not. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9844.4s)]
*  It is art, but it's like, it's also, don't get goofy with it. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9845.4s)]
*  We're not supposed to be the pretentious ones. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9849.4s)]
*  Right. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9850.4s)]
*  It sounds pretentious. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9851.4s)]
*  It does sound pretentious. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9852.4s)]
*  We should look down upon at the award shows. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9853.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9855.4s)]
*  Because they are like, we're artists. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9856.4s)]
*  I say we should look down upon the award shows. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9857.4s)]
*  When I saw Joe Coy do that award show, I didn't get upset that Joe Coy didn't, his jokes didn't hit. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9859.4s)]
*  I got upset that he was willing to do it. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9865.4s)]
*  Joe Coy, you sell out arenas. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9866.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9868.4s)]
*  Don't do that terrible thing. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9869.4s)]
*  But you want, you always want to be a part of that club. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9870.4s)]
*  Don't, don't do it. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9872.4s)]
*  I think you have to go in. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9873.4s)]
*  It's first of all, you're handicapped. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9874.4s)]
*  You're doing it with 10 days notice. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9875.4s)]
*  What kind of goofy. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9876.4s)]
*  That you shouldn't have done. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9877.4s)]
*  What kind of goofy ass fucking organizers hire top talent with 10 days. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9878.4s)]
*  No one wants to do it. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9881.4s)]
*  Nobody wants to do it. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9882.4s)]
*  Nobody wants to do it. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9883.4s)]
*  Nobody did. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9884.4s)]
*  To Kevin Hart where they were like, you made, you said the word gay. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9885.4s)]
*  Gay jokes in the 90s. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9887.4s)]
*  And guess what? [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9888.4s)]
*  You fucking awarded Roman Polanski like man of the year 15 years ago. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9889.4s)]
*  Accused of rape. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9893.4s)]
*  So, not accused, he did it. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9894.4s)]
*  Will Smith slaps Chris Rock on stage and then they give him a standing ovation. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9896.4s)]
*  Disgusting. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9900.4s)]
*  The whole thing's ridiculous. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9901.4s)]
*  They're ridiculous people. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9902.4s)]
*  The point is, fucking shun award shows. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9903.4s)]
*  Any time someone calls us artists, I think of a comic asking an audience member, are [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9906.4s)]
*  you taking a poop or a pee as they're walking to the bathroom? [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9911.4s)]
*  We're not artists. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9913.4s)]
*  But the problem is the word art has been hijacked by douchebags. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9914.4s)]
*  We are artists. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9918.4s)]
*  But we're artists in the sense that we create things. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9919.4s)]
*  Everybody who creates things is an artist. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9921.4s)]
*  Just like a chef is an artist. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9923.4s)]
*  I bet chefs probably, the pretentious ones, will refer to themselves as artists. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9925.4s)]
*  The fucking down to earth dudes. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9929.4s)]
*  Those are my least favorite chefs. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9931.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9932.4s)]
*  The fucking fine dining chefs. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9933.4s)]
*  You're like, all right dude, give me something that will fill me up. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9935.4s)]
*  There's a fine line where you can cross over into pretentious land. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9938.4s)]
*  I think the problem is we got into this to be funny and some people lose sight of that [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9943.4s)]
*  and they start pandering. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9946.4s)]
*  I can tell when a comic stops fucking touring. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9947.4s)]
*  I can tell when you stop taking it through Missouri. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9950.4s)]
*  You've got to take it through every fucking state. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9953.4s)]
*  You've got to make this, I don't want to use the word marketable, but you've got to make this palatable for the country. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9955.4s)]
*  There's a reason, if I do a joke about New York, it's for everybody. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9962.4s)]
*  If I do a joke about riding the subway, it's hitting in Kansas City because it has to. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9966.4s)]
*  Otherwise, you would be working for your small bubble. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9970.4s)]
*  When I see comics put out specials, I can be like, this dude only worked it out in LA or New York or whatever. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9973.4s)]
*  You need the road because the second you stop relating or remembering what got you into this for the right reason, [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9978.4s)]
*  you're doing it for the wrong reason. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9984.4s)]
*  You also have to remember when you were first starting out, the idea of being on the road, [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9986.4s)]
*  headlining a comedy club would be the craziest fucking dream you could ever imagine. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9991.4s)]
*  I don't have to go to my day job anymore. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=9998.4s)]
*  Now I get to fly to Cincinnati and go do stand-up comedy, to pack crowds. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10000.4s)]
*  Half packed. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10006.4s)]
*  Two shows on Friday. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10007.4s)]
*  Half packed. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10008.4s)]
*  Half packed. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10009.4s)]
*  Pretty good crowds. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10010.4s)]
*  Go bananas. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10011.4s)]
*  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday sometimes. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10012.4s)]
*  It's a dream. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10014.4s)]
*  It's a dream. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10015.4s)]
*  It's the ultimate dream because the idea of being a professional seems so impossible to achieve. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10016.4s)]
*  Yeah, it felt amazing and I romanticized the road as I still do. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10021.4s)]
*  It was a different thing. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10025.4s)]
*  It was like, thank God I can do this, to now I'm like, gotta hone it. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10026.4s)]
*  Well, that was the thing about Jenny. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10030.4s)]
*  When I was first doing the road, one of the things I would always ask, I was like, [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10032.4s)]
*  who's the biggest douchebag that you had to take? [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10036.4s)]
*  I asked that too. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10038.4s)]
*  It was always Jenny. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10039.4s)]
*  He just hated it. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10040.4s)]
*  He hated being on the road. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10041.4s)]
*  He was a douche to people? [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10042.4s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10044.4s)]
*  He was very uncomfortable. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10045.4s)]
*  Obviously, he was... [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10047.4s)]
*  He wanted to be a bigger movie star, right? [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10048.4s)]
*  He wanted to be a movie star. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10049.4s)]
*  He was a great actor. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10050.4s)]
*  Well, he was really good in the mask. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10051.4s)]
*  Great movie. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10053.4s)]
*  But really what he was, was a great standup. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10054.4s)]
*  But great standups weren't appreciated the way they are now. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10056.4s)]
*  If Jenny was alive today, he'd be doing arenas. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10059.4s)]
*  That's what would be going on. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10062.4s)]
*  He would be one of the biggest standup comics alive. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10064.4s)]
*  But during his time, no one did anything other than comedy clubs. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10066.4s)]
*  There's a few guys, like Sam Kinison, [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10071.4s)]
*  he used to do Great Woods Center for the Performing Arts. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10073.4s)]
*  Rodney did that. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10075.4s)]
*  Bill Cosby did that. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10076.4s)]
*  But for the most part, standup comics did comedy clubs, [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10078.4s)]
*  and that's it, including Jenny. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10081.4s)]
*  And he just felt like a failure when he was on the road [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10083.4s)]
*  headlining these clubs. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10086.4s)]
*  What a sad thing. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10087.4s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10088.4s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10089.4s)]
*  They all wanted the golden egg, [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10090.4s)]
*  and the golden egg was what Roseanne got, [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10092.4s)]
*  or what Tim Allen got. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10094.4s)]
*  It was a sitcom. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10095.4s)]
*  That generation doesn't get it. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10096.4s)]
*  I did Letterman's show on Netflix, [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10097.4s)]
*  and he was baffled by me putting out YouTube specials. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10099.4s)]
*  And not in a way that he was so kind. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10102.4s)]
*  He was such a nice guy. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10104.4s)]
*  But I remember he kept asking me, [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10105.4s)]
*  I don't get how you make money off this. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10106.4s)]
*  Well, I make the money off touring, [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10108.4s)]
*  but you got to understand, when I did this shit, [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10109.4s)]
*  it was all about the sitcom. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10111.4s)]
*  That was the money. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10113.4s)]
*  So as we said, the industry's changing. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10114.4s)]
*  A lot of really funny comics were passed over [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10118.4s)]
*  by these industry streamers and then did their own thing. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10121.4s)]
*  And then at a certain point, they'll find you. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10124.4s)]
*  The point is to not get bitter. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10126.4s)]
*  You look at a guy like Shane Gillis, [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10128.4s)]
*  and did he get bitter? [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10130.4s)]
*  No, he stayed fucking funny. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10131.4s)]
*  He got funnier. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10133.4s)]
*  Of course. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10134.4s)]
*  He even got better when he got canceled. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10135.4s)]
*  It's just, there's a different world now [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10137.4s)]
*  where there's no gatekeepers anymore. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10140.4s)]
*  The gatekeepers, they still exist if you want to participate. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10142.4s)]
*  If you want to do the Comedy Central thing, they still exist. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10145.4s)]
*  HBO still makes specials. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10148.4s)]
*  You can do it that way if you choose to. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10150.4s)]
*  But the gatekeepers of real mass media are now non-existent. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10152.4s)]
*  It's all just YouTube. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10156.4s)]
*  So then you have to be careful with whatever YouTube's terms of services are, [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10157.4s)]
*  because some of them get real squirrely, and you can get banned. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10163.4s)]
*  The goalpost is moving in. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10166.4s)]
*  It's moving. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10167.4s)]
*  They're changing the rules. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10168.4s)]
*  If you make a Nazi joke now, they're like, [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10169.4s)]
*  did you say the word Nazi? [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10171.4s)]
*  You're like, I was condemning Nazis. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10172.4s)]
*  That was satirical. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10173.4s)]
*  But you said the word Nazi in some fucking algorithm [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10175.4s)]
*  that can't detect sarcasm. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10177.4s)]
*  It's like, time out. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10178.4s)]
*  Not good. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10180.4s)]
*  Yeah, not good. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10181.4s)]
*  It's also, it's clumsy, but it's also, you know, [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10182.4s)]
*  they're fucking, you're dealing with an enormous number of human beings. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10185.4s)]
*  You're managing at scale. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10189.4s)]
*  That's impossible to really even wrap our stupid little heads around. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10191.4s)]
*  The amount of humans that are like, just, [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10195.4s)]
*  but which really leads us back to that guy's text message getting intercepted. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10198.4s)]
*  Like, are they just doing that with everything? [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10203.4s)]
*  Because it appears they are. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10205.4s)]
*  If they're doing that in a Snapchat message group, [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10206.4s)]
*  which is supposed to be encrypted, [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10209.4s)]
*  and they find the word, I'm going to blow up this plane, terrorist, [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10211.4s)]
*  whatever, ISIS, Taliban, whatever it is, [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10214.4s)]
*  they see those words, if those words, like, if they get flagged, [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10216.4s)]
*  that means nothing is private. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10219.4s)]
*  Also, you have to recognize, you want, oh, I want everybody to be safe. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10221.4s)]
*  Okay, right. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10225.4s)]
*  But those are human beings, just like you. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10226.4s)]
*  This is like you having the kind of power that it means to have, [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10228.4s)]
*  to access everyone's text messages. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10232.4s)]
*  That's nuts. [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10234.4s)]
*  That's a crazy power. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10236.4s)]
*  And if you're the guy, I mean, I don't care how many checks and balances there are. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10237.4s)]
*  There's got to be somebody at the end of that stream [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10240.4s)]
*  that could just read and see all your dick pics. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10242.4s)]
*  There's somebody at the end of that stream. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10245.4s)]
*  Good angles. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10247.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10248.4s)]
*  Does somebody see every time you swipe right. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10249.4s)]
*  There's somebody that sees it all. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10251.4s)]
*  Great. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10252.4s)]
*  Yeah, they see everything. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10253.4s)]
*  And that is probably inevitable. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10254.4s)]
*  With the bottleneck of technology being interconnectivity, right? [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10258.4s)]
*  The other problem with that is money. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10262.4s)]
*  Because if money is just ones and zeros, [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10264.4s)]
*  and it gets to the point where, when you get to quantum computing, [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10267.4s)]
*  where any sort of encryption is really preposterous, [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10270.4s)]
*  and then people have commercial-grade quantum computing in their house, [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10273.4s)]
*  and you can kind of like, there's no code that can't be cracked. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10278.4s)]
*  There's no Bitcoin that can't be stolen. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10281.4s)]
*  And then what happens? [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10283.4s)]
*  Like, what happens then? [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10284.4s)]
*  Like, how do you have money? [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10285.4s)]
*  How can you trust anything? [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10287.4s)]
*  How do you trust anything? [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10288.4s)]
*  How do we trust anything now when these deep, [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10289.4s)]
*  I'm in so many ads for products that I'm definitely not selling. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10291.4s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10295.4s)]
*  I'm in so many of them, man. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10297.4s)]
*  I'm in so many of them, man. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10298.4s)]
*  People send them to me all the time. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10299.4s)]
*  Deep fakes and shit? [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10300.4s)]
*  Total deep fakes. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10301.4s)]
*  But how can you trust not just machines, but any... [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10302.4s)]
*  I remember reading about Leonard Cohen. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10305.4s)]
*  His manager stole his $5 million retirement fund. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10307.4s)]
*  That's why he was touring in his 70s. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10310.4s)]
*  Happens. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10312.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10313.4s)]
*  Happens all the time. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10314.4s)]
*  Machines, people, I mean, like, with money and your information, [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10315.4s)]
*  you're putting a lot of trust in either. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10318.4s)]
*  Yeah, you're putting a lot of trust in a lot of different things. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10320.4s)]
*  But also, like... [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10323.4s)]
*  I'm not a communist and I'm not a socialist. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10328.4s)]
*  And I'm definitely pro-capitalist. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10330.4s)]
*  But I envision a future where all of these things, [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10332.4s)]
*  where I think these mechanisms that we have used to achieve power [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10338.4s)]
*  and influence and what Will Storrs had talked about yesterday, [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10344.4s)]
*  the status game, status, [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10347.4s)]
*  all of these things will eventually lead us to some point in the future [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10350.4s)]
*  where, I mean, it might... [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10356.4s)]
*  We could get to a point where any idea of competition [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10360.4s)]
*  that we're having right now, what human beings enjoy right now, [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10365.4s)]
*  all goes away. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10368.4s)]
*  And we all become a part of some network, [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10370.4s)]
*  some network that changes what it means to be a human being. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10373.4s)]
*  Like, human beings stop being human. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10376.4s)]
*  I think we're not that far away from that. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10379.4s)]
*  And if you look at what we are today versus what Fatty Arbuckle was, [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10381.4s)]
*  imagine you being friends with Fatty Arbuckle back in the day [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10385.4s)]
*  and William Randolph Hearst but also having a YouTube channel. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10389.4s)]
*  You're like, look, William Randolph Hearst is a piece of shit. [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10391.4s)]
*  Like, this is what he did about marijuana. [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10394.4s)]
*  This is what he did about this. [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10396.4s)]
*  This is what he did to Fatty Arbuckle. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10397.4s)]
*  This is why they did it to Fatty. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10398.4s)]
*  This is what actually happened. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10400.4s)]
*  This is what a woman had a chronic bladder infection. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10401.4s)]
*  And, you know, it could be, like, a big thing. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10403.4s)]
*  It could be, like, something everybody talks about. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10405.4s)]
*  And it gets the ruling overturned. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10407.4s)]
*  But back then, you had no chance. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10409.4s)]
*  As things move on, it'll be more of that. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10411.4s)]
*  Well, there's pluses and minuses to more people having voices, right? [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10414.4s)]
*  I mean... [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10418.4s)]
*  A lot of minuses. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10419.4s)]
*  A lot of minuses. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10420.4s)]
*  There's a lot of crazy people out there. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10422.4s)]
*  There's a lot of legitimately schizophrenic, [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10423.4s)]
*  insane people, aggressive people, sad people, [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10426.4s)]
*  like, abused people, people that came from terrible childhoods, [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10429.4s)]
*  people that came from, you know, every stretch of the world. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10433.4s)]
*  And they're all... [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10438.4s)]
*  All they have to do is learn English. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10439.4s)]
*  And they're just interfacing with you. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10441.4s)]
*  And they get the worst roll of dice that's available on planet Earth. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10443.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10447.4s)]
*  And now, you know, they've killed three people by the time they're 15. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10448.4s)]
*  You know? [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10450.4s)]
*  And now they're online. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10451.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10453.4s)]
*  And that's real, too. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10454.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10456.4s)]
*  I mean, it's... [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10457.4s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10458.4s)]
*  You get into this for acceptance, right? [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10459.4s)]
*  You get into stand-up, because you, like... [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10460.4s)]
*  You want to... [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10462.4s)]
*  Maybe, I don't know, maybe you're in your mind, [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10463.4s)]
*  you're like, this wasn't able to be said in my household. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10465.4s)]
*  So now, in my mind, I'm telling the truth on stage. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10468.4s)]
*  I'm being funny. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10470.4s)]
*  I'm making strangers laugh. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10471.4s)]
*  And you're doing this for acceptance. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10473.4s)]
*  There was rejection before this. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10475.4s)]
*  Now it's like the amount of people who could flood your fucking timeline [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10477.4s)]
*  when you make a misstep. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10480.4s)]
*  Right. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10481.4s)]
*  It can be overwhelming. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10482.4s)]
*  I mean, I think of that guy, John Ronson, all the time, right? [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10483.4s)]
*  So you've been publicly shamed, guy? [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10485.4s)]
*  I mean, people know... [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10487.4s)]
*  You should know what you do when you try to fucking destroy a person, [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10489.4s)]
*  but it is exciting. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10492.4s)]
*  A lot of people, what they use social media for is to complain [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10494.4s)]
*  and then to try to bury a person. [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10498.4s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Yeah. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10500.4s)]
*  And it's fucking weird. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10502.4s)]
*  It's just a dumb thing to do. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10504.4s)]
*  And I think the best thing to do, if you're, like, a public person, [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10506.4s)]
*  like yourself, is just, like, never engage in that, [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10509.4s)]
*  and also don't read the comments. [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10511.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10513.4s)]
*  That's my advice. [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10514.4s)]
*  My advice is always never engage, don't read the comments. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10515.4s)]
*  If you want to post something, you feel something about something, [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10517.4s)]
*  you want to say something about something, that's fine. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10519.4s)]
*  But don't be upset about people's response to it. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10521.4s)]
*  Exactly. It's part of the game. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10523.4s)]
*  We put ourselves out there where you're... [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10525.4s)]
*  But it also doesn't mean you have to fucking, [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10527.4s)]
*  while they're throwing fastballs, you have to run across the pitcher [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10529.4s)]
*  and get hit in the head. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10531.4s)]
*  You don't have to actually go out on the field. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10533.4s)]
*  Like, it is part of the game. [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10535.4s)]
*  But you don't have to do that part. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10537.4s)]
*  That part is not necessary. It's also not good. [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10539.4s)]
*  It's not smart. It's not a good allocation of resources. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10541.4s)]
*  It's not good psychologically. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10543.4s)]
*  I don't know about the fans either, because if you actually... [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10545.4s)]
*  What if they're just having a bad day, man, [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10547.4s)]
*  and they're fucking 18, they lash out at Sam, [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10549.4s)]
*  you know, or they lash out at Normand, [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10551.4s)]
*  or they lash out at Ari? [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10553.4s)]
*  They're not really bad people, [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10555.4s)]
*  but they're writing something, [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10557.4s)]
*  and it's permanent, it's out there forever. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10559.4s)]
*  And they said some rude shit, [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10561.4s)]
*  and they're trying to get a response. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10563.4s)]
*  And then you come back with the most scathing response, [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10565.4s)]
*  and then you show pictures of their mom and them, [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10567.4s)]
*  and their fat belly, [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10569.4s)]
*  and you shit all over them online. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10571.4s)]
*  This is going far, though. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10573.4s)]
*  Right. But we've all known people who've done that, right? [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10575.4s)]
*  Sure. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10577.4s)]
*  And it's just not wise. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10579.4s)]
*  It's not good. I've done it before. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10581.4s)]
*  I've experienced that thing of, like, [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10583.4s)]
*  fuck you, and I'll fuck you, you're a fucking loser. [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10585.4s)]
*  No benefit. [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10587.4s)]
*  Last message Bob Saget ever sent me, I engaged with a fucking psycho, [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10589.4s)]
*  and he goes, hey, it's Uncle Bob here. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10591.4s)]
*  You're too good a guy to be doing this. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10593.4s)]
*  Beautiful. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10595.4s)]
*  RIP, Bob. Sweet guy. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10597.4s)]
*  He is a very sweet guy. He was a hard one. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10599.4s)]
*  He was a hard one. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10601.4s)]
*  I didn't know him well. We were just becoming friends when he passed away. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10603.4s)]
*  I became friends with him at the store. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10605.4s)]
*  He was such a sweet guy. He was always a nice guy. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10607.4s)]
*  Always a nice guy. Always, like, real. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10609.4s)]
*  Like, genuinely warm. Like, he'd come around. Everybody liked him. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10611.4s)]
*  We need that. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10613.4s)]
*  People who bring positive energy to work [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10615.4s)]
*  are fucking so important. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10617.4s)]
*  I've never met anybody who didn't like Saget. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10619.4s)]
*  He was always nice. [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10621.4s)]
*  There's, like, a few guys where I don't know anybody [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10623.4s)]
*  doesn't like him. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10625.4s)]
*  Bobby Lee's one of those. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10627.4s)]
*  He's one of those. You don't like Bobby Lee, I don't like you. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10629.4s)]
*  Bobby is... [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10631.4s)]
*  I don't like you if you don't like Bobby Lee. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10633.4s)]
*  Is it safe to say he's maybe the best podcast guest ever? [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10635.4s)]
*  He's amazing. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10637.4s)]
*  It's insane the energy he brings. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10639.4s)]
*  He's so funny. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10641.4s)]
*  I've known Bobby for 30 years. [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10643.4s)]
*  Damn, I've known him long, but I love him. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10645.4s)]
*  Close to it. It's probably close to 30 years. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10647.4s)]
*  I brought a friend of mine when he did our podcast. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10649.4s)]
*  He's an Asian guy I used to live with. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10651.4s)]
*  And he, like, worships Bobby. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10653.4s)]
*  And Bobby just fucked with him the whole day. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10655.4s)]
*  And my friend Dory, it was so satisfying for him. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10657.4s)]
*  He's like... [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10659.4s)]
*  Bobby's like, stop talking to me, fuck you. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10661.4s)]
*  And he was like, that was the best day of my life. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10663.4s)]
*  He's such a good guy too, because [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10665.4s)]
*  he's so honest about all of his weirdness. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10667.4s)]
*  His flaws. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10669.4s)]
*  And how he thinks about himself. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10671.4s)]
*  And he's so vulnerable. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10673.4s)]
*  Which is also very funny, man. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10675.4s)]
*  And he's getting ready to do a special, finally. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10677.4s)]
*  Actually, I think it was from when he was on your podcast. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10679.4s)]
*  I texted him, I was like, you better put out a fucking special, dude. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10681.4s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, why? [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10683.4s)]
*  And I said, you know why. [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10685.4s)]
*  Because you're fucking hilarious. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10687.4s)]
*  And because you deserve it. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10689.4s)]
*  You deserve to release something. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10691.4s)]
*  And to move on. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10693.4s)]
*  And to suffer a little bit. [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10695.4s)]
*  He's a much better comic than people know. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10697.4s)]
*  In terms of the amount of tickets he sells. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10699.4s)]
*  Bobby Lee should be doing arenas. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10701.4s)]
*  And he just did an arena with Bert and Tom. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10703.4s)]
*  He just did the MGM. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10705.4s)]
*  But it's because he's not releasing it. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10707.4s)]
*  So now that he's releasing it. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10709.4s)]
*  It's like his level's very high. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10711.4s)]
*  Their level's very, very high. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10713.4s)]
*  They just don't have a lot of stuff out there. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10715.4s)]
*  He's told me he's scared to eat the shit. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10717.4s)]
*  To build a new hour. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10719.4s)]
*  And let me tell you, I'm thinking when I burn this next one. [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10721.4s)]
*  I am dreading the shit out of this. [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10723.4s)]
*  I hate starting from scratch. [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10725.4s)]
*  Yeah, man, just gotta embrace it. [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10727.4s)]
*  Embrace the suck. It's fun. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10729.4s)]
*  Get in there. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10731.4s)]
*  It's like jumping in a cold ass pool. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10733.4s)]
*  I fucking hate it. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10735.4s)]
*  But I gotta jump in the pool. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10737.4s)]
*  Yeah, do it every day. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10739.4s)]
*  That's all it is. [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10741.4s)]
*  There's a few of those guys out there that just need a little gentle nudge. [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10743.4s)]
*  To get into the water. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10745.4s)]
*  And then Bobby Lee will have a new hour in no time. [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10747.4s)]
*  Because he'll have to. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10749.4s)]
*  And it'll be better than his hour before. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10751.4s)]
*  Because it'll be more representative of how he feels about things right now. [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10753.4s)]
*  And his life is interesting. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10755.4s)]
*  Yes, he's fascinating. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10757.4s)]
*  And he's too self loathing. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10759.4s)]
*  I'm sorry Bobby. You gotta love yourself a little more. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10761.4s)]
*  Because he's loved, that guy. [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10763.4s)]
*  He is loved, but he needs friends around him. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10765.4s)]
*  And the problem with a lot of us. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10767.4s)]
*  Is that we can become islands. [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10769.4s)]
*  I always describe comedians as islands or tribe members. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10771.4s)]
*  And there's a few of those islands out there. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10773.4s)]
*  That only have one opening act. [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10775.4s)]
*  That they take with them. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10777.4s)]
*  They only do theaters. [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10779.4s)]
*  And they travel around. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10781.4s)]
*  And every now and then they get to be around comics like us. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10783.4s)]
*  Hey, so let's walk in the club. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10785.4s)]
*  It's weird. There's a few of those guys. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10787.4s)]
*  I don't want to name names. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10789.4s)]
*  But there's a few of those guys. I don't think it's healthy. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10791.4s)]
*  I don't think it's a healthy existence. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10793.4s)]
*  That's literally why I'm still calling it The Cellar. [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10795.4s)]
*  I love the show. I love the show. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10797.4s)]
*  I can't wait to show you the club. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10799.4s)]
*  Because we set it up as best we could. [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10801.4s)]
*  To facilitate all that. [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10803.4s)]
*  To make it so that it's like the best environment for comics to hang. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10805.4s)]
*  The best environment for comics to work. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10807.4s)]
*  Everything's set up. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10809.4s)]
*  The staff is magnificent. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10811.4s)]
*  Everybody's cool as fuck. [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10813.4s)]
*  It's great man. It's amazing. [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10815.4s)]
*  But it's also entirely set up for the comics. [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10817.4s)]
*  Entirely. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10819.4s)]
*  There's not one decision that ever gets made. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10821.4s)]
*  That's to the detriment of the show. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10823.4s)]
*  Or the comics feelings. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10825.4s)]
*  Most comedy clubs that were made by a comic. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10827.4s)]
*  Are often like a comic who quit. [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10829.4s)]
*  And has got some bitterness. [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10831.4s)]
*  And you're not that guy. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10833.4s)]
*  So you made it the right way. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10835.4s)]
*  Well you know the best aspects of the store were beautiful. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10837.4s)]
*  And there was so much to the store that the mothership will never be able to have. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10839.4s)]
*  Because the store had this history. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10841.4s)]
*  This insane history. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10843.4s)]
*  This legacy to it. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10845.4s)]
*  Of Kinnison and Prior. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10847.4s)]
*  And Hicks started there. [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10849.4s)]
*  Hicks was a doorman. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10851.4s)]
*  Great great great great comics that came out of that place. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10853.4s)]
*  And so there was [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10855.4s)]
*  Mitzi's store. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10857.4s)]
*  There's a reason why I have her on my wall. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10859.4s)]
*  The reason why. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10861.4s)]
*  Why we named the bar Mitzi's. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10863.4s)]
*  It's like so we took her [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10865.4s)]
*  philosophy and we just threw a Spotify [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10867.4s)]
*  budget at it. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10869.4s)]
*  I love it. [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10871.4s)]
*  Let's go ham. Let's do something [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10873.4s)]
*  good for the community of comedy. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10875.4s)]
*  And create what Louie calls it the Alamo. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10877.4s)]
*  I love it. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10879.4s)]
*  And I said yeah it's like that's [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10881.4s)]
*  that's the thought behind it. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10883.4s)]
*  It's like let's do it. Like if I can do this [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10885.4s)]
*  and like I can do this and I don't feel any [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10887.4s)]
*  pressure it doesn't bother me at all. [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10889.4s)]
*  I mean I feel pressure like with like [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10891.4s)]
*  staff stuff and shit [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10893.4s)]
*  this is happening or something wrong with the AC [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10895.4s)]
*  unit. There's a little bit of that every now and then. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10897.4s)]
*  But it's not bad. But it's not financial [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10899.4s)]
*  pressure which is the most intolerable [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10901.4s)]
*  pressure when you don't think you can pay your bills. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10903.4s)]
*  You're worried. Especially if you're a father. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10905.4s)]
*  You're like shit. So if that pressure is alleviated [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10907.4s)]
*  then you can do something that you really want to do. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10909.4s)]
*  And I'm like I want to really [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10911.4s)]
*  do it like like fucking [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10913.4s)]
*  Disneyland for comics. I want to [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10915.4s)]
*  set it up so that it's the [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10917.4s)]
*  best environment ever for people [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10919.4s)]
*  to be able to develop and create. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10921.4s)]
*  And even people starting out. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10923.4s)]
*  Like the doorman, the doorman [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10925.4s)]
*  people, the doorman women they're all auditioned [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10927.4s)]
*  by EGIT. So EGIT [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10929.4s)]
*  he auditions them. He sees their act. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10931.4s)]
*  So they're all comics. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10933.4s)]
*  He cares. Yeah. And they get to see Shane [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10935.4s)]
*  Gillis go up. [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10937.4s)]
*  You know they get to see Howie Mandel [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10939.4s)]
*  stop by and Jim Gaffigan stop [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10941.4s)]

*  these are murderous shows. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10953.4s)]
*  They're murderous shows. It's all of us. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10955.4s)]
*  So these people get to see how we're writing [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10957.4s)]
*  and how we're coming up with new shit and how we [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10959.4s)]
*  change things up. And it's like [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10961.4s)]
*  this you get an education [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10963.4s)]
*  that we got at the store. We all got that at the store [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10965.4s)]
*  from watching you know the guys who were there [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10967.4s)]
*  before us. You know the [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10969.4s)]
*  big names when I was 27 [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10971.4s)]
*  and I first came to the store and I'd see Damon Wayans [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10973.4s)]
*  go up and Eddie Griffin go up. Beasts [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10975.4s)]
*  right? Wayans and his promise killer. [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10977.4s)]
*  Wayans was a beast. Underappreciated [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10979.4s)]
*  man. The last stand [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10981.4s)]
*  Damon Wayans is a HBL [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10983.4s)]
*  special. Funny that's when he went in the crowd [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10985.4s)]
*  right? It's when he threw the mic down he said he was quitting. [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10987.4s)]
*  That guy is a real professional [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10991.4s)]
*  in the sense that he films every [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10993.4s)]
*  one of his shows he has [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10995.4s)]
*  since the 90's. He sets up his own [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10997.4s)]
*  video camera on a tripod and he [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=10999.4s)]
*  films every one of his shows. [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11001.4s)]
*  Workout shows. Any show. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11003.4s)]
*  And he is not scared of [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11005.4s)]
*  silence. I used to [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11007.4s)]
*  watch him go up when I was a [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11009.4s)]
*  kid. First of all I was a fan of his from [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11011.4s)]
*  In Living Color. Call me the clown. I was a fan [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11013.4s)]
*  of his stand up. I'd seen him on the [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11015.4s)]
*  Robert Townsend thing. Remember Robert Townsend [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11017.4s)]
*  had those stand up shows? Of course. Hilarious guy. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11019.4s)]
*  So I was a fan of his already and then I got to see [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11021.4s)]
*  him workout. Like at the store [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11023.4s)]
*  he had probably like 130, 50 people. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11025.4s)]
*  You know small ass OR [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11027.4s)]
*  crowds. And he just [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11029.4s)]
*  didn't give a fuck. He just would find [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11031.4s)]
*  a bit. He would find where it is. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11033.4s)]
*  He'd like [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11035.4s)]
*  search around for it. Didn't worry at all [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11037.4s)]
*  about the dead spots. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11039.4s)]
*  Didn't worry at all. Just he's like [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11041.4s)]
*  that's my workout role. When a comic has earned that it's [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11043.4s)]
*  a beautiful thing. Oh it's a beautiful thing. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11045.4s)]
*  But it's also the store was low [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11047.4s)]
*  pressure back then. Like the way you were describing [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11049.4s)]
*  The Cellar where you're going on after murderers [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11051.4s)]
*  it's very difficult to work on new stuff. It's tough. Even the young comics [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11053.4s)]
*  there are so good. There's young comics. There's like [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11055.4s)]
*  a young comic named Maddie Weiner. She's so [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11057.4s)]
*  funny. There's young com- Daniel [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11059.4s)]
*  Simonson is so funny. All these comics [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11061.4s)]
*  they're like- Hungry. They're just murderers. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11063.4s)]
*  And so then you're following them [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11065.4s)]
*  with your new shit and you're like [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11067.4s)]
*  alright. [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11069.4s)]
*  So I was on a flight coming [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11071.4s)]
*  back here and they're like what are you doing? [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11073.4s)]
*  They can sniff the new on you. [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11075.4s)]
*  So I do most of my work on the [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11077.4s)]
*  what I like to do is like an hour of good jokes [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11079.4s)]
*  and then I'm like alright guys now I'm doing [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11081.4s)]
*  ten minutes of brand new shit. Oh you do it at the end? [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11083.4s)]
*  I'll preface it. Yeah. Interesting. I like to [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11085.4s)]
*  I like to just say here's my- cause sometimes [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11087.4s)]
*  and then I get the confidence to just work it in. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11089.4s)]
*  Yeah. If it's killing- You're already killing. [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11091.4s)]
*  Yeah so I get the confidence and then I'll just [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11093.4s)]
*  I'll mold it in once it's [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11095.4s)]

*  development deals to star in a sitcom. [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11395.4s)]
*  And I got to experience that world which is a very [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11397.4s)]
*  bizarre world. But I didn't like it. [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11399.4s)]
*  I didn't like the dealing with all the meetings [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11401.4s)]
*  and all the things. So when Fear Factor came along [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11403.4s)]
*  I was like hold on. No actors. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11405.4s)]
*  No writers at all. Like what [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11407.4s)]
*  do I have to do. And also this is [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11409.4s)]
*  an opportunity for material because this is going to get canceled. [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11411.4s)]
*  And I'm going to have a giant bit about this [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11413.4s)]
*  fucking stupid show where they stick dogs on people [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11415.4s)]
*  and made them eat dicks. And the [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11417.4s)]
*  show got canceled. And then it goes on forever. [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11419.4s)]
*  It goes on for six years [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11421.4s)]
*  and it's 148 episodes. [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11423.4s)]
*  It was so nuts. Wow. [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11425.4s)]
*  But I specifically did it because [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11427.4s)]
*  I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to do the [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11429.4s)]
*  fucking the grind [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11431.4s)]
*  of what it means. I don't know what actors [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11433.4s)]
*  do it. I mean just the [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11435.4s)]
*  waiting around. The waiting for your phone to [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11437.4s)]
*  ring. Well it's better than working [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11439.4s)]
*  in a coal mine. Of course. [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11441.4s)]
*  I just mean psychologically. Of course [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11443.4s)]
*  it's great. If you can make a living at it that's [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11445.4s)]
*  incredible. Also you're dealing with people [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11447.4s)]
*  that are psychologically damaged already [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11449.4s)]
*  most likely. Which is why they need exorbitant [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11451.4s)]
*  amounts of attention. Which is why [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11453.4s)]
*  they want to be the fucking [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11455.4s)]
*  the star in this new Laura Croft [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11457.4s)]
*  movie. [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11459.4s)]
*  This is a normal thing. Like for psychos. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11461.4s)]
*  Like you got ignored by your dad. [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11463.4s)]
*  And now all of a sudden you're in this [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11465.4s)]
*  fucking crazy movie. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11467.4s)]
*  I'll show you Pop. And guess what? I ain't going to [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11469.4s)]
*  fucking fill the void. It never does. [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11471.4s)]
*  You think it will but. You got to fill that void [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11473.4s)]
*  on your own. Exactly. But I do think that [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11475.4s)]
*  it's possible for someone because I definitely think that I [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11477.4s)]
*  came into comedy with like a neediness. [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11479.4s)]
*  Like I just was just like trying to like [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11481.4s)]
*  show that I was worthy of something. [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11483.4s)]
*  And then eventually [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11485.4s)]
*  you get confident and then you realize [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11487.4s)]
*  like well it's not like [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11489.4s)]
*  it's not like this can't be [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11491.4s)]
*  turned in a different direction. [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11493.4s)]
*  And then my obsession could now be [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11495.4s)]
*  in getting better at this art. [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11497.4s)]
*  And getting better at this thing that I love. [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11499.4s)]
*  This thing that I enjoy. [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11501.4s)]
*  That's like a really good exchange. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11503.4s)]
*  Between audience members and [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11505.4s)]
*  comic. It's a really good exchange. [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11507.4s)]

*  of doing it. So I know it's a good experience. [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11515.4s)]
*  Do you still watch specials? Yeah I'll do [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11517.4s)]
*  occasionally. Like if [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11519.4s)]
*  I'm home and I have time. I just don't [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11521.4s)]

*  watt brain and it's never going to [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11985.4s)]
*  change. It's never going to get stronger. [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11987.4s)]
*  Genetically he's fucked. Supposed to be [[03:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11989.4s)]
*  a ditch digger and then they get him. [[03:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11991.4s)]
*  And so they get 50 bucks from that guy [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11993.4s)]
*  and 100 bucks from this guy and 1000 bucks from that guy [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11995.4s)]
*  and 5000 from this moron. How do they [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11997.4s)]
*  get away with it though? Isn't there a way to track this? [[03:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=11999.4s)]
*  I think they just do it from other [[03:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12001.4s)]
*  countries and they do it with [[03:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12003.4s)]
*  so many different accounts and they do it to a separate [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12005.4s)]
*  website. It's another video. [[03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12007.4s)]
*  It's the same exact [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12009.4s)]
*  video, same exact audio. Look at this. [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12011.4s)]
*  But it says Warren Buffett has decided to [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12013.4s)]
*  whiten his reputation [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12015.4s)]
*  by just giving money away at the end of [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12017.4s)]
*  his life. May sound fun [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12019.4s)]
*  but don't lose the fucking opportunity. [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12021.4s)]
*  Look at that. So that's like they're tricking you to getting [[03:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12025.4s)]
*  mad at him for being rich and it's a different [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12027.4s)]
*  website. So there's probably thousands [[03:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12029.4s)]
*  of these websites and they're probably [[03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12031.4s)]
*  all the money goes into the same account. [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12033.4s)]
*  Holy shit. And they're probably extracting [[03:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12035.4s)]
*  who knows how much money from how many morons. [[03:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12037.4s)]
*  Also I remember hearing this [[03:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12039.4s)]
*  not how recently this was [[03:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12041.4s)]
*  but a couple years ago that as the rest of the world [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12043.4s)]
*  has been coming online and getting access to broadband [[03:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12045.4s)]
*  internet and faster and faster and we've had [[03:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12047.4s)]
*  the last 15, 20 years all the [[03:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12049.4s)]
*  scams that we've been having happen [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12051.4s)]
*  to us are now happening [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12053.4s)]
*  en masse to them like the Nigerian [[03:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12055.4s)]
*  Prince game if you will. It's like the most famous [[03:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12057.4s)]
*  one. Someone reaching out. Now they're using [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12059.4s)]
*  Deepfakes to do that but it's [[03:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12061.4s)]
*  happening to the people that just got [[03:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12063.4s)]
*  the internet. They'll get people for a [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12065.4s)]
*  while. Oh yeah forever. [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12067.4s)]
*  They're getting us today. Yeah. [[03:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12069.4s)]
*  People are always getting got by these [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12071.4s)]
*  fucking stupid things. There's always something that comes [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12073.4s)]
*  along. Whether it's [[03:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12075.4s)]
*  fucking [[03:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12077.4s)]
*  the crypto guys from the [[03:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12079.4s)]
*  Bahamas, FTC. [[03:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12081.4s)]
*  I mean how many people did they get? [[03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12083.4s)]
*  They got very intelligent people. [[03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12085.4s)]
*  You look at people who are just catfishing [[03:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12087.4s)]
*  you're just doing it for the love of the game. [[03:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12089.4s)]
*  Catfishing is still just a sport. [[03:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12091.4s)]
*  It's a sport. Yeah it's like catch and [[03:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12093.4s)]
*  release fishing. [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12095.4s)]
*  You don't get anything out of it. [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12097.4s)]
*  You just love this. [[03:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12099.4s)]
*  You just love to dupe someone. You love to [[03:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12101.4s)]
*  dupe some sad kid from Syracuse. [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12103.4s)]
*  Or some fucking horny athlete. [[03:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12105.4s)]
*  Wow yeah. [[03:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12107.4s)]
*  What's his name? [[03:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12109.4s)]
*  That was a great Netflix thing. [[03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12111.4s)]
*  Mantetayo. Do you see that shit? Oh I heard about that one. [[03:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12113.4s)]
*  How'd they get him? [[03:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12115.4s)]
*  Just like a sweet kid too. It was some woman who [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12117.4s)]
*  wouldn't meet him. [[03:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12119.4s)]
*  But he's like a college athlete. He's too busy anyway. [[03:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12121.4s)]
*  And then you know you gotta meet the person though. [[03:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12123.4s)]
*  I think something happens [[03:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12125.4s)]
*  when people connect with people online. [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12127.4s)]
*  Where you develop this very bizarre [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12129.4s)]
*  attraction to them because you don't [[03:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12131.4s)]
*  really know them yet in person. [[03:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12133.4s)]
*  You're communicating back and forth. [[03:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12135.4s)]
*  You're both putting forth your [[03:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12137.4s)]
*  best face. And if you're a young athlete [[03:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12139.4s)]
*  who's like a football player [[03:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12141.4s)]
*  and this lady's saying all the right things. [[03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12143.4s)]
*  Untold. The girlfriend didn't touch. [[03:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12145.4s)]
*  Yeah like out of touch. [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12147.4s)]
*  Yeah he didn't know. [[03:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12149.4s)]
*  He's like a sweet kid too. [[03:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12151.4s)]
*  And by the way there's a Netflix thing on him. [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12153.4s)]
*  And he comes out looking great. [[03:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12155.4s)]
*  And the guy who catfished him. [[03:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12157.4s)]
*  This is a psychopath. No remorse. [[03:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12159.4s)]
*  Right. That's a terrible person. [[03:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12161.4s)]
*  The idea is that you're allowed to do that to a person [[03:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12163.4s)]
*  you don't even know because that person's famous. [[03:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12165.4s)]
*  You're allowed to destroy their life and do something [[03:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12167.4s)]
*  horrible to them just because they're famous. [[03:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12169.4s)]
*  That's crazy. But also [[03:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12171.4s)]
*  you also have to deal with why couldn't he [[03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12173.4s)]
*  see that coming. Why couldn't he [[03:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12175.4s)]
*  recognize. And then you have to take into account. [[03:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12177.4s)]
*  He's a kid. Yeah and he's a football player. [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12179.4s)]
*  Okay. [[03:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12181.4s)]
*  You know you're colliding heads of people [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12183.4s)]
*  all the time. [[03:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12185.4s)]
*  All the time. All the time. [[03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12187.4s)]
*  You know. [[03:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12189.4s)]
*  It's not healthy. Football [[03:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12191.4s)]
*  is probably the most dangerous sport there is. [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12193.4s)]
*  I mean when you look at like the blackouts [[03:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12195.4s)]
*  and the CTE like what offensive linemen [[03:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12197.4s)]
*  have to deal with. I think it's probably the most [[03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12199.4s)]
*  vicious sport we have. I think it explains Shane Gillis. [[03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12201.4s)]
*  I do. [[03:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12205.4s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[03:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12207.4s)]
*  It explained Kinnison. [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12209.4s)]
*  Did he play football? No he got hit in the head by a car. [[03:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12211.4s)]
*  That's right. Yeah. [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12213.4s)]
*  So did Roseanne. [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12215.4s)]
*  There was a comedian on Kiltoni recently that [[03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12217.4s)]
*  he was funny. He's new. He's a young guy [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12219.4s)]
*  from Austin but he was telling a story recently [[03:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12221.4s)]
*  over a pandemic. He fell off of a balcony and landed on his head. [[03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12223.4s)]
*  Broke his face. [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12225.4s)]
*  All his teeth are fake. [[03:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12227.4s)]
*  I was like listening to them. I was like oh this isn't going to be another guy. [[03:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12229.4s)]
*  He's probably going to be a hilarious comedian but [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12231.4s)]
*  life probably changed because of a head injury. [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12233.4s)]
*  Well it's not guaranteed you're going to be [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12235.4s)]
*  funny. I'm not recommending you get hit by [[03:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12237.4s)]
*  a car. I'm not saying no. He didn't do it on purpose. [[03:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12239.4s)]
*  This isn't Spider-Man. It happened. [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12241.4s)]
*  You're trying to nail it. [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12243.4s)]
*  You're like let me just fucking hit my head [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12245.4s)]
*  proper. No that's not how I said it. [[03:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12247.4s)]
*  That's not how I meant it. Yeah. You're either going to be [[03:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12249.4s)]
*  mentally challenged or you're going to be [[03:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12251.4s)]
*  a pretty solid open micer. [[03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12253.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12255.4s)]
*  I think I attribute some of my success to [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12257.4s)]
*  brain damage. Yeah? [[03:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12259.4s)]
*  That's probably something there. Do you take a lot of hits? [[03:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12261.4s)]
*  Yeah for sure. But it's enough that [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12263.4s)]
*  I'm cognizant. I'm aware. But I also have [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12265.4s)]
*  a level of don't give a fuck [[03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12267.4s)]
*  that's probably not healthy. [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12269.4s)]
*  It might be healthy. [[03:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12271.4s)]
*  But it needs to be managed all the time [[03:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12273.4s)]
*  with strenuous exercise and [[03:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12275.4s)]
*  voluntary [[03:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12277.4s)]
*  difficult things like cold plunge [[03:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12279.4s)]

*  on a regular basis. [[03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12289.4s)]
*  To fucking keep it in check. But I think [[03:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12291.4s)]
*  there's a certain amount of brain [[03:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12293.4s)]
*  damage that's not bad. [[03:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12295.4s)]
*  Just a touch. Just a touch [[03:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12297.4s)]

*  of your body as your vehicle. [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12317.4s)]
*  And if you have a Nissan GTR [[03:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12319.4s)]
*  you can take a GTR and you can put a fucking [[03:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12321.4s)]
*  big ass turbo in it [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12323.4s)]

*  you do that? Wouldn't it be better if it works better? [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12327.4s)]
*  Like some of the strip mall in Indianapolis. [[03:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12329.4s)]
*  That's why. Yeah but [[03:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12331.4s)]
*  still. You want energy. [[03:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12333.4s)]
*  No you're right. The energy of your mind [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12335.4s)]
*  is directly connected to the energy [[03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12337.4s)]
*  of your body. And we want to pretend [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12339.4s)]
*  that it's not because there was like a time [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12341.4s)]
*  of intellectual snobbery where taking care [[03:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12343.4s)]
*  of your body was thought as vain and [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12345.4s)]
*  stupid. It's a moron's [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12347.4s)]
*  approach. No you really [[03:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12349.4s)]
*  you made people healthier I think. [[03:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12351.4s)]
*  In a way where you're like, no this is smart. [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12353.4s)]
*  This is, we need our. Yeah dude I'm pushing [[03:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12355.4s)]
*  60. I'm 56 years old. [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12357.4s)]
*  You don't look it. But that's [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12359.4s)]
*  possible. I'm not doing anything [[03:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12361.4s)]
*  crazy that other people can't do too. [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12363.4s)]
*  You can do it. You just have to be on top [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12365.4s)]
*  of it. And you have to not let your body degrade. [[03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12367.4s)]
*  Because once your body degrades, building your [[03:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12369.4s)]
*  body up is very very very very [[03:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12371.4s)]
*  very hard. But maintaining your body [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12373.4s)]
*  is not as hard. You just have to be [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12375.4s)]
*  like really dedicated to it. The same way you're dedicated [[03:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12377.4s)]
*  to brushing your teeth. Same way you're dedicated [[03:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12379.4s)]
*  to eating food. Don't you eat food every day? [[03:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12381.4s)]
*  Yes. Well that's because you have to right? Stay alive. [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12383.4s)]
*  You also have to exercise. [[03:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12385.4s)]
*  You should exercise a minimum [[03:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12387.4s)]
*  five days a week I think. I think that's smart. [[03:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12389.4s)]
*  I mean look when we were on the road, we did a tour bus [[03:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12391.4s)]
*  last year a few times. And like we'd be out 14 days [[03:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12393.4s)]
*  or whatever at a time. Every day [[03:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12395.4s)]
*  we would wake up in a new city. We'd hit a rec [[03:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12397.4s)]
*  center. Beautiful. We'd play basketball. Nice. [[03:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12399.4s)]
*  We'd do whatever. We'd steam. [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12401.4s)]
*  We'd shower. We'd get breakfast. Big way [[03:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12403.4s)]
*  to start the day. Great way to start the day. And we drink at night [[03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12405.4s)]
*  but guess what? We sweat it the fuck out. Yeah. [[03:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12407.4s)]
*  Take some electrolytes. Get some liquid [[03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12409.4s)]
*  IV. Pound it. Pound some vitamins [[03:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12411.4s)]
*  and glutathione. Great. Yeah. [[03:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12413.4s)]
*  You can mitigate it. And you can also [[03:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12415.4s)]
*  like give your body [[03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12417.4s)]
*  more of a chance to be robust [[03:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12419.4s)]
*  while you're traveling. And avoid [[03:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12421.4s)]
*  sickness and avoid fatigue [[03:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12423.4s)]
*  and all the shit that fucks with bad [[03:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12425.4s)]
*  shows. When you have that feeling [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12427.4s)]
*  backstage you feel like shit and then you gotta go on stage. [[03:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12429.4s)]
*  That's a terrible feeling. [[03:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12431.4s)]
*  I mean back in the day three shows. Remember the [[03:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12433.4s)]
*  three show nights? Oh my god. [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12435.4s)]
*  The three show nights were so squirrely for me because I'm a [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12437.4s)]
*  marijuana proponent. And [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12439.4s)]
*  I would often forget. Did I bring this up [[03:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12441.4s)]
*  already? This is the third show. Is this the second show? [[03:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12443.4s)]
*  Sober is fucking hard. But if you're [[03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12445.4s)]
*  high? And then when you lock in. Like when you lock [[03:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12447.4s)]
*  in and you're doing stand up you're just [[03:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12449.4s)]
*  in it, right? You're in those bits. [[03:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12451.4s)]
*  But then if you're free balling [[03:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12453.4s)]
*  which often you're likely to do if you're doing [[03:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12455.4s)]
*  three shows you want to make it interesting [[03:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12457.4s)]
*  so you mix up the order. And you're like oh my [[03:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12459.4s)]

*  That's why I'm terrified of Adderall. [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12475.4s)]
*  I'm terrified of any stimulants. [[03:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12477.4s)]
*  Stimulants scare the shit out of me. They work. [[03:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLzl1CRmupE&t=12479.4s)]
