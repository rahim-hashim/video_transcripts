# Joe Rogan Experience #2064 - Mike Baker
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6.0s)]
*  Hello Mr. Baker. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=12.0s)]
*  Greetings to you Mr. Rogan. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=14.0s)]
*  We always have to bring you in when the world's fucked. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=18.0s)]
*  Someday I'm going to bring you in when everything's great. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=19.0s)]
*  That would be, you know, I'd look forward to that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=21.0s)]
*  And we could just talk about other things, but... [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=23.0s)]
*  You were my go-to guy when there's international conflict. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=25.0s)]
*  And I'm like, what the fuck is going on? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=27.0s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciate that because we have some conflict. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=29.0s)]
*  That's what I hear. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=31.0s)]
*  God. Yeah. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=33.0s)]
*  So what the fuck is going on, Mike? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=35.0s)]
*  Tell me the real deal. What's happening? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=37.0s)]
*  Well, there's something happening in the Middle East [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=39.0s)]
*  that's taking everybody's eye off the ball [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=41.0s)]
*  and what's happening in Ukraine. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=43.0s)]
*  Which is amazing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=45.0s)]
*  7 October happened [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=47.0s)]
*  with that incredible medieval slaughter by Hamas. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=49.0s)]
*  And I was amazed at how much of a [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=51.0s)]
*  I mean, I guess I know that people have attention deficit disorder, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=54.0s)]
*  but you didn't see anything about Ukraine. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=56.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's over. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=58.0s)]
*  Or the conflict for the next couple of weeks, right? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=60.0s)]
*  It took them that long to then think, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=62.0s)]
*  okay, well, we still got this thing going on over here, right? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=64.0s)]
*  People die and there's a, you know, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=66.0s)]
*  Putin continues to operate his meat grinder for the Russian soldiers. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=68.0s)]
*  And, you know, so that was incredible. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=70.0s)]
*  And I think that's what's going on in the Middle East. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=72.0s)]
*  And I think that's what's going on in the Middle East. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=74.0s)]
*  And I think that's what's going on in the Middle East. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=76.0s)]
*  And I think that's what's going on in the Middle East. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=78.0s)]
*  And I think that's what's going on in the Middle East. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=80.0s)]
*  You know, so that was incredible. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=82.0s)]
*  But then timing-wise, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=84.0s)]
*  the other thing that I thought was amazing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=86.0s)]
*  was despite the brutality of the 7 October attacks, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=88.0s)]
*  and Hamas knew this was going to happen, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=92.0s)]
*  but the number of days that it took to turn the narrative around, right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=94.0s)]
*  So everybody was horrified at how terrible the slaughter was. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=102.0s)]
*  And then within a matter of days, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=104.0s)]
*  it was like, now it's Israel's fault. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=106.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=108.0s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=110.0s)]
*  Hamas knew that was going to happen because that's what they count on, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=112.0s)]
*  which is why they embed themselves with civilians. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=114.0s)]
*  It's why they put, you know, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=116.0s)]
*  their operations centers, their tunnels, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=118.0s)]
*  their weapons stockpiles. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=120.0s)]
*  It's why they put it all underneath civilian infrastructure, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=122.0s)]
*  like the Al-Shifa Hospital that's been in the news lately [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=126.0s)]
*  and in other places, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=128.0s)]
*  because they know that they're going to end up with dead Palestinians. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=130.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=134.0s)]
*  And that's kind of, it sounds wrong, but it's kind of their currency. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=136.0s)]
*  It's kind of what they expect. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=138.0s)]
*  And they don't give a shit. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=140.0s)]
*  I mean, you can see just by the way that Hamas has governed, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=142.0s)]
*  if you can call it that, Gaza, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=144.0s)]
*  for, what is that? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=146.0s)]
*  That's new math for me. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=148.0s)]
*  But since 2006, really, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=150.0s)]
*  they kicked out Fatah, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=152.0s)]
*  they kicked out the Palestinian Authority in 2007. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=154.0s)]
*  So you can tell by the fact that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=156.0s)]
*  they've done nothing to improve the lives of Palestinians. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=158.0s)]
*  They don't give a shit about Palestinians. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=160.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=162.0s)]
*  That's not their point. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=164.0s)]
*  They're not going to give a shit about the extermination of Israel, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=166.0s)]
*  because they're overlord in the Iranian regime. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=168.0s)]
*  That's their purpose in life, too. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=170.0s)]
*  So it's, you know, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=172.0s)]
*  I hate to start off on a really, really, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=174.0s)]
*  you know, cynical rant, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=176.0s)]
*  but they know, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=178.0s)]
*  because they're very, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=180.0s)]
*  they're clever. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=182.0s)]
*  They've got a good public relations group, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=184.0s)]
*  if you want to call it that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=186.0s)]
*  They understand how international media works. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=188.0s)]
*  They know that it won't take much time [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=190.0s)]
*  for condemnation of Israel, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=192.0s)]
*  and then you end up with dead Palestinian civilians, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=194.0s)]
*  which is incredibly sad. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=196.0s)]
*  It's very sad for the Palestinian people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=198.0s)]
*  Their plight is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=200.0s)]
*  legitimately awful. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=202.0s)]
*  But, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=204.0s)]
*  to imagine somehow, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=206.0s)]
*  that Hamas [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=208.0s)]
*  cares about them, or has been some sort of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=210.0s)]
*  benevolent, I knew I was going to be able to say that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=212.0s)]
*  That's a word. That's a fucking word. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=214.0s)]
*  Benevolent. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=216.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=218.0s)]
*  Governing body of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=220.0s)]
*  Gaza is ridiculous. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=222.0s)]
*  So, I don't know. I guess it's hard to tell [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=224.0s)]
*  where I stand on this issue. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=226.0s)]
*  It's so strange that some people, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=228.0s)]
*  particularly like these really crazy leftists, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=230.0s)]
*  have gone as far as [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=232.0s)]
*  saying they were happy when the slaughter took place. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=234.0s)]
*  I've seen that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=236.0s)]
*  You had staffers [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=238.0s)]
*  in the UN's refugee [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=240.0s)]
*  office. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=242.0s)]
*  I mean, again, keeping a perspective, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=244.0s)]
*  not a lot of them, maybe in private [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=246.0s)]
*  they were, but you had some staffers [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=248.0s)]
*  celebrating, openly, through social media, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=250.0s)]
*  about what happened [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=252.0s)]
*  on the 7th of October. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=254.0s)]
*  You've got [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=256.0s)]
*  college campuses [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=258.0s)]
*  filled with useful idiots who are happy to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=260.0s)]
*  spout the Hamas narrative. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=262.0s)]
*  And you've got [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=264.0s)]
*  protests in the streets. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=266.0s)]
*  Some people earnestly hoping [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=268.0s)]
*  for a better situation for Palestine. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=270.0s)]
*  Other folks couldn't [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=272.0s)]
*  find Gaza [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=274.0s)]
*  on a map if you took a map and shoved it up [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=276.0s)]
*  their ass. It wouldn't work. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=278.0s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=280.0s)]
*  It's the latest thing. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=282.0s)]
*  So I don't want to put all the protesters in one camp because [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=284.0s)]
*  some are legitimately working [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=286.0s)]
*  to better the lives of Palestinians. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=288.0s)]
*  And yes, you can feel awful about what happens [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=290.0s)]
*  with the civilians. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=292.0s)]
*  But [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=294.0s)]
*  I'm not sure what people expect [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=296.0s)]
*  Israel to do after what [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=298.0s)]
*  happened on the 7th of October. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=300.0s)]
*  And after [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=302.0s)]
*  Hamas continued to say, well, we're just going to keep doing this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=304.0s)]
*  It wasn't like they said, well, there you go. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=306.0s)]
*  That was a one-off. No. They said, we're going to keep [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=308.0s)]
*  doing this. Because that's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=310.0s)]
*  their purpose in life [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=312.0s)]
*  is the destruction of Israel. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=314.0s)]
*  I mean, I believe people [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=316.0s)]
*  sometimes when they say things and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=318.0s)]
*  that's what they mean. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=320.0s)]
*  It sucks. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=324.0s)]
*  That's something that people need to understand [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=326.0s)]
*  that they are embedding [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=328.0s)]
*  these troops and they're embedding [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=330.0s)]
*  these weapons stockpiles and all these different things [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=332.0s)]
*  in civilian infrastructure. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=334.0s)]
*  Yeah, there was a lot of, I think there's, well, there has [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=336.0s)]
*  been a lot of skepticism [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=338.0s)]
*  about that. And people saying, no, that's [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=340.0s)]
*  Israel's excuse for targeting [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=342.0s)]
*  civilians. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=344.0s)]
*  And [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=346.0s)]
*  now [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=348.0s)]
*  we're getting some pretty good evidence [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=350.0s)]
*  that that's not the case. Isn't a lot of that stuff [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=352.0s)]
*  blown up underneath? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=354.0s)]
*  Well, like [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=356.0s)]
*  they were just [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=358.0s)]
*  releasing [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=360.0s)]
*  evidence of what they found when they went into [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=362.0s)]
*  the Rentisi Children's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=364.0s)]
*  Hospital in Gaza. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=366.0s)]
*  And again, weapons stockpiles [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=368.0s)]
*  disturbingly [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=370.0s)]
*  makeshift [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=372.0s)]
*  rooms or holding cells. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=374.0s)]
*  So it appears as if they could have been holding [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=376.0s)]
*  some of the hostages there, moved them [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=378.0s)]
*  before the IDF got in. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=380.0s)]
*  But [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=382.0s)]
*  they've done the same with Al-Shifa. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=384.0s)]
*  They've gone into this. And that's a large, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=386.0s)]
*  large hospital compound. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=388.0s)]
*  And they have been saying [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=390.0s)]
*  for years that they use Al-Shifa [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=392.0s)]
*  as essentially the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=394.0s)]
*  command central point for the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=396.0s)]
*  military structure there for Hamas. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=398.0s)]
*  And also for, again, for [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=400.0s)]
*  weapons stockpiles. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=402.0s)]
*  I mean, you can't [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=404.0s)]
*  be more cynical [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=406.0s)]
*  as an organization like [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=408.0s)]
*  Hamas than to be storing [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=410.0s)]
*  ammunition and weapons [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=412.0s)]
*  underneath a children's hospital [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=414.0s)]
*  as an example. I mean, so [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=416.0s)]
*  yeah, I think the best thing that can happen [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=418.0s)]
*  sounds weird to say [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=420.0s)]
*  that in a situation like this, but [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=422.0s)]
*  Israel needs to be very transparent. They need to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=424.0s)]
*  provide as much evidence of this to try [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=426.0s)]
*  to shift that narrative. At least the people [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=428.0s)]
*  who aren't rabid [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=430.0s)]
*  about this, but have kind of jumped on [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=432.0s)]
*  the free Palestine bandwagon [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=434.0s)]
*  because they like to feel righteous. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=436.0s)]
*  So at least some of those people [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=438.0s)]
*  you can shift off of that narrative [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=440.0s)]
*  by providing evidence [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=442.0s)]
*  by being transparent. So [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=444.0s)]
*  hopefully that's what the IDF does. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=446.0s)]
*  The US has come out and said, look, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=448.0s)]
*  we back up that intelligence. We have [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=450.0s)]
*  independent corroboration [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=452.0s)]
*  that they've been using Al-Shifa and other [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=454.0s)]
*  hospitals, Hamas [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=456.0s)]
*  has, for their personnel, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=458.0s)]
*  for their stockpiles. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=460.0s)]
*  The reality is it's not going to change much of the narrative. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=464.0s)]
*  I've been surprised by [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=466.0s)]
*  apparently how many anti-Semitic bigots [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=468.0s)]
*  were just like in [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=470.0s)]
*  the shadows waiting for an opportunity to jump out. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=472.0s)]
*  Crazy, right? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=474.0s)]
*  The open anti-Semitism online is [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=476.0s)]
*  so shocking. People chanting [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=478.0s)]
*  in the streets, Death to the Jews, like [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=480.0s)]
*  what? Yeah, from a variety of quarters. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=482.0s)]
*  In 2023. Yeah, in 2023. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=484.0s)]
*  I guess it's naive to think that maybe [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=488.0s)]
*  we didn't have that problem anymore, but [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=490.0s)]
*  it's there. Jewish people [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=492.0s)]
*  have always been saying it, and a lot of people have been saying [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=494.0s)]
*  oh, you guys are exaggerating. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=496.0s)]
*  And now I guess everybody has to shut [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=498.0s)]
*  the fuck up about that. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=500.0s)]
*  It's not [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=502.0s)]
*  only that they're not exaggerating, they're kind of underplaying it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=504.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were definitely [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=506.0s)]
*  underplaying it, but I think that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=508.0s)]
*  if you look at [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=510.0s)]
*  again, if you look at what's happening here in America, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=512.0s)]
*  there's layers to it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=516.0s)]
*  You get [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=518.0s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=520.0s)]
*  the Palestinian-American [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=522.0s)]
*  in Congress, and she's a member [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=524.0s)]
*  of whatever they call it, the squad. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=526.0s)]
*  And [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=528.0s)]
*  so she comes out, and she's [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=530.0s)]
*  fairly [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=532.0s)]
*  rabid, meaning what she's saying [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=534.0s)]
*  about it is not particularly eloquent. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=536.0s)]
*  And so she gets censured because [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=538.0s)]
*  she's just out there [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=540.0s)]
*  spouting almost what appears to be [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=542.0s)]
*  pro-Hamas, or making some sort [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=544.0s)]
*  of equivalency. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=546.0s)]
*  She tweeted the incorrect story [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=548.0s)]
*  about the bombing of the hospital [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=550.0s)]
*  being the responsibility of [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=552.0s)]
*  Israel, and it wasn't. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=554.0s)]
*  That's actually a really, that's a great point [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=556.0s)]
*  because the attacks [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=558.0s)]
*  took place on 7 October, and then [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=560.0s)]
*  a few days after, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=562.0s)]
*  there was that explosion [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=564.0s)]
*  at the hospital. And [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=566.0s)]
*  not only Rashida Tlaib, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=568.0s)]
*  but the New York Times, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=570.0s)]
*  major news outlets [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=572.0s)]
*  took the word [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=574.0s)]
*  of Hamas, the group that had just [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=576.0s)]
*  days before conducted this [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=578.0s)]
*  awful slaughter. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=580.0s)]
*  They took their word and said [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=582.0s)]
*  oh yeah, it was an Israeli airstrike targeting [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=584.0s)]
*  a hospital. And they [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=586.0s)]
*  went with it. And you think, what the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=588.0s)]
*  fuck is wrong with you? Not only that, it [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=590.0s)]
*  hit the parking lot. It didn't even hit the hospital. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=592.0s)]
*  And there wasn't 500 people [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=594.0s)]
*  dead. No, there was no [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=596.0s)]
*  journalistic curiosity. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=598.0s)]
*  There was no thought [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=600.0s)]
*  that said, well, maybe [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=602.0s)]
*  before we run with the word of [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=604.0s)]
*  a terrorist organization that just proved [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=606.0s)]
*  how medieval they are, maybe we should [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=608.0s)]
*  do our own independent checking. But [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=610.0s)]
*  I get it, in today's world, everybody wants to [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=612.0s)]
*  beat the clock and be the first with a story. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=614.0s)]
*  But how do you do that when you're in the New York Times? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=616.0s)]
*  Apparently, it's not difficult. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=618.0s)]
*  How do you do that when you're a congresswoman? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=620.0s)]
*  Yeah. But she [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=622.0s)]
*  comes out. And I guess the point is, she's [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=624.0s)]
*  one layer of this, right? Of this sort of [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=626.0s)]
*  anti-Semitism. And [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=628.0s)]
*  she's trying to couch it in, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=630.0s)]
*  I'm not an anti-Semite, I'm [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=632.0s)]
*  drawing some sort of moral equivalency between [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=634.0s)]
*  Hamas and [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=636.0s)]
*  Israel. And I get it, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=638.0s)]
*  it's a massively complicated [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=640.0s)]
*  history, right? There's nothing more complicated [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=642.0s)]
*  than the history of Palestine [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=644.0s)]
*  and Israel and the settlements and all the rest [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=646.0s)]
*  of it. And no one's probably ever going to solve it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=648.0s)]
*  But [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=650.0s)]
*  then you've got other, you've got the campus [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=652.0s)]
*  activity. And again, those are youthful people [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=654.0s)]
*  that like to feel righteous [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=656.0s)]
*  about things. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=658.0s)]
*  You've got Barack Obama, right, going [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=660.0s)]
*  on a podcast [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=662.0s)]
*  talking about this. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=664.0s)]
*  Whose podcast are you going on? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=666.0s)]
*  What was that called? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=668.0s)]
*  Pod Save America. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=670.0s)]
*  But on that, he [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=674.0s)]
*  basically attempted to, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=676.0s)]
*  well, he didn't attempt, he did. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=678.0s)]
*  But in a very subtle, very [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=680.0s)]
*  sophisticated way, more sophisticated [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=682.0s)]
*  than others who get out there and [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=684.0s)]
*  scream from the river to the sea, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=686.0s)]
*  he talked about this [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=688.0s)]
*  like, okay, well it was an unbearable [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=690.0s)]
*  situation for the Palestinians, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=692.0s)]
*  which implies that [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=694.0s)]
*  you know, it's kind of [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=696.0s)]
*  he's not justifying it, I guess, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=698.0s)]
*  in a sense. But people will read [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=700.0s)]
*  that into it, right? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=702.0s)]
*  And that's dangerous in [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=704.0s)]
*  itself, right? Because, well, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=706.0s)]
*  he's listened to, right? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=708.0s)]
*  And he's [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=710.0s)]
*  beloved. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=712.0s)]
*  I guess I could use the word beloved. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=714.0s)]
*  Anyway, so I guess [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=716.0s)]
*  what I'm saying is there's layers of this anti-Semitism [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=718.0s)]
*  or there's layers of this [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=720.0s)]
*  excusing what [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=722.0s)]
*  took place while not [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=724.0s)]
*  you know, again, I don't want to put words [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=726.0s)]
*  in people's mouths, but that's what they're doing. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=728.0s)]
*  Right? And by calling [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=730.0s)]
*  for a ceasefire, as an example, if you call [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=732.0s)]
*  for a ceasefire, then you're basically [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=734.0s)]
*  saying, I'm okay with the status quo. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=736.0s)]
*  Because a ceasefire is not going to lead to a two-state [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=738.0s)]
*  solution. It's not going to lead to [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=740.0s)]
*  stability. It's going to lead to more [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=742.0s)]
*  violence, more terrorism. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=744.0s)]
*  And the only people that win in a situation like that would be [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=746.0s)]
*  Hamas and the Iranian [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=750.0s)]
*  regime. So, you know, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=752.0s)]
*  I think it's, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=754.0s)]
*  again, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=756.0s)]
*  it's the most complicated [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=758.0s)]
*  issue [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=760.0s)]
*  of our time. And for [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=762.0s)]
*  generations, right? It's just, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=764.0s)]
*  and I don't think there's going to be a solution. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=766.0s)]
*  So from Israel's perspective, they're saying, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=768.0s)]
*  all right, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=770.0s)]
*  we understood that international [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=772.0s)]
*  condemnation would be coming as soon as we tried [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=774.0s)]
*  to deal with the problem. We have to deal [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=776.0s)]
*  with the problem, though, because who else is going [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=778.0s)]
*  to do it for them? Who else is going to help them? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=780.0s)]
*  You know, clearly, there's a lot of [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=782.0s)]
*  people who have no interest in that. So [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=784.0s)]
*  I think their feeling, if we can degrade [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=786.0s)]
*  Hamas sufficiently, I don't think you [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=788.0s)]
*  ever destroy a terrorist organization [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=790.0s)]
*  or, you know, certainly never get terrorism [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=792.0s)]
*  down to nothing, right? It's not a [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=794.0s)]
*  zero-sum game. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=796.0s)]
*  But if you can degrade it enough [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=798.0s)]
*  so that they can never govern again [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=800.0s)]
*  in Gaza, they can never [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=802.0s)]
*  conduct [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=804.0s)]
*  their terrorist operations again, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=806.0s)]
*  at least you've advanced the ball [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=808.0s)]
*  towards something [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=810.0s)]
*  that could be more stable. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=812.0s)]
*  Now, it depends on what [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=814.0s)]
*  backfills Hamas's [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=816.0s)]
*  governance of Gaza, and that's a [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=818.0s)]
*  massive question, right? But [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=820.0s)]
*  anyway. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=822.0s)]
*  Elon was on a podcast recently with Lex Friedman, and one [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=824.0s)]
*  of the things he was talking about was like, with every [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=826.0s)]
*  civilian Palestinian that dies, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=828.0s)]
*  how many more members of Hamas have you created? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=830.0s)]
*  And that's a very good point, right? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=832.0s)]
*  It's a very good point. Yeah. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=834.0s)]
*  And civilians have died now. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=836.0s)]
*  But Hamas has also spent [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=838.0s)]
*  years [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=840.0s)]
*  kind of shaping curriculum, right? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=842.0s)]
*  Teaching children to hate Israel. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=844.0s)]
*  Teaching children that, you know, killing Jews [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=846.0s)]
*  is kind of your [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=848.0s)]
*  lot in life, right? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=850.0s)]
*  So, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=852.0s)]
*  yes, I mean, but [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=854.0s)]
*  so then you're faced with this, what do we do? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=856.0s)]
*  Do we keep them around? Do we allow them to keep doing [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=858.0s)]
*  what they're doing? Or do you [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=860.0s)]
*  try to, you know, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=862.0s)]
*  remove that cancer, right? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=864.0s)]
*  And do you try to say, okay, whatever comes [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=866.0s)]
*  in, maybe that's better. Look, it's not [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=868.0s)]
*  like the Palestinian people overwhelmingly [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=870.0s)]
*  support Hamas. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=872.0s)]
*  There was a [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=874.0s)]
*  poll, believe it or not, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=876.0s)]
*  doing polls out in [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=878.0s)]
*  Gaza, asking [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=880.0s)]
*  who is best [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=882.0s)]
*  served to represent [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=884.0s)]
*  the Palestinian people? Would it be [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=886.0s)]
*  Hamas or would it be Fatah? Would it be, you know, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=888.0s)]
*  and only [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=890.0s)]
*  30% of [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=892.0s)]
*  the people [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=894.0s)]
*  felt that, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=896.0s)]
*  you know, Hamas was [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=898.0s)]
*  their [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=900.0s)]
*  answer. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=902.0s)]
*  40 plus percent [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=904.0s)]
*  said neither, right? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=906.0s)]
*  So it's not as if the Palestinian [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=908.0s)]
*  people are all out there, you know, cheering [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=910.0s)]
*  for Hamas, right? Clearly some are. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=912.0s)]
*  But [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=914.0s)]
*  we have to imagine what does it [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=916.0s)]
*  look like. At some point the conflict [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=918.0s)]
*  ends. At some point they are [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=920.0s)]
*  degraded sufficiently. At some point [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=922.0s)]
*  the international pressure is just to the point [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=924.0s)]
*  where they have to stop, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=926.0s)]
*  I suppose. And then [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=928.0s)]
*  you have to ask, what does that look like? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=930.0s)]
*  It can't be a long-term Israeli occupation. They [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=932.0s)]
*  don't want that. So, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=934.0s)]
*  you know, the US [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=936.0s)]
*  steps in. That's what the US administration [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=938.0s)]
*  always does. And they imagine that they've [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=940.0s)]
*  got an answer. And so they say, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=942.0s)]
*  well, let's have the Palestinian authority [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=944.0s)]
*  govern [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=946.0s)]
*  Gaza. Because the Palestinian authority [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=948.0s)]
*  governs West Bank, of course. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=950.0s)]
*  And we have this two [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=952.0s)]
*  government situation because [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=954.0s)]
*  back in 2006 or whatever, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=956.0s)]
*  2006 I believe, Hamas [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=958.0s)]
*  violently kicked out [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=960.0s)]
*  the Palestinian authority. They said, we're taking [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=962.0s)]
*  over Gaza. So they took over Gaza. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=964.0s)]
*  West Bank is left [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=966.0s)]
*  to the Palestinian authority. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=968.0s)]
*  So the US is saying, well, you know, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=970.0s)]
*  we'll let Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=972.0s)]
*  authority come in. Anthony Blinken goes [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=974.0s)]
*  over, talks to Abbas. You know, they'd say, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=976.0s)]
*  well, maybe this. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=978.0s)]
*  You know, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=980.0s)]
*  Israel is against the idea. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=982.0s)]
*  Why is [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=984.0s)]
*  Israel against the idea? Well, they're saying in part [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=986.0s)]
*  they're saying in part because [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=988.0s)]
*  look, they're saying Mahmoud [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=990.0s)]
*  Abbas and the Palestinian authority haven't even [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=992.0s)]
*  bothered to condemn what took place on the 7th [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=994.0s)]
*  of October. So they say, how can [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=996.0s)]
*  you then have this same [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=998.0s)]
*  group running? He says, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1000.0s)]
*  that's not a solution. That's not [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1002.0s)]
*  advancing the ball in any way. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1004.0s)]
*  That's their point. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1006.0s)]
*  Point of the Palestinian people is when you [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1008.0s)]
*  did that survey of who's best, you know, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1010.0s)]
*  capable and who deserves [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1012.0s)]
*  to represent the Palestinian people. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1014.0s)]
*  Yeah, Hamas only got about 30 percent of the vote. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1016.0s)]
*  Fatah got only 20 percent of the vote. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1020.0s)]
*  So it's not like they want them there [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1022.0s)]
*  either. But the US is [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1024.0s)]
*  kind of wedging that in as a scenario saying, look, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1026.0s)]
*  this is the way we go. Just kind of like, you know, Biden comes [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1028.0s)]
*  in and says, well, we should have a pause. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1030.0s)]
*  We should have a three day pause. We should have a... [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1032.0s)]
*  And, you know, they almost get a little [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1034.0s)]
*  petulant because Israel's not listening [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1036.0s)]
*  to them. And [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1038.0s)]
*  Israel, you know, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1040.0s)]
*  obviously gets a lot of support from the US. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1042.0s)]
*  But this is... this time [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1044.0s)]
*  is different. This time is, you know, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1046.0s)]
*  I think what happened on the 7th of October [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1048.0s)]
*  marks a complete [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1050.0s)]
*  sea change from their perspective. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1052.0s)]
*  So they're going to do what they need to do [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1054.0s)]
*  from their perspective and move on. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1056.0s)]
*  But that question of, again, what backfills, what [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1058.0s)]
*  comes in behind is [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1060.0s)]
*  critical. But nobody's got a good answer. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1062.0s)]
*  From an intelligence perspective, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1064.0s)]
*  how did that [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1066.0s)]
*  October 7 thing not get [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1068.0s)]
*  detected? I mean, doesn't the idea [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1070.0s)]
*  of... don't they have agents embedded [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1072.0s)]
*  in Hamas? Don't they [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1074.0s)]
*  have like [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1076.0s)]
*  the most intense security system [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1078.0s)]
*  ever and surveillance system ever? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1080.0s)]
*  They do. Yeah. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1082.0s)]
*  And it was a massive intelligence failure. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1084.0s)]
*  And in part, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1086.0s)]
*  it was a very... [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1088.0s)]
*  it was a very... [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1090.0s)]
*  I don't want to say sophisticated. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1092.0s)]
*  Sophisticated is the wrong word. But [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1094.0s)]
*  in terms of the planning of this, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1096.0s)]
*  if you're conducting an operation [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1098.0s)]
*  or you're conducting any intelligence [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1100.0s)]
*  really concerned, then [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1102.0s)]
*  the first thing you need to [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1104.0s)]
*  know... you need to worry about is need to know. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1106.0s)]
*  So how do you limit [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1108.0s)]
*  information? How do you limit [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1110.0s)]
*  the dissemination of information [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1112.0s)]
*  about what you're doing? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1114.0s)]
*  And that's just good [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1116.0s)]
*  OPSEC. That's good operational security. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1118.0s)]
*  Now, that's what they did. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1120.0s)]
*  They displayed [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1122.0s)]
*  extremely [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1124.0s)]
*  sophisticated, I suppose, operational [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1126.0s)]
*  security over this. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1128.0s)]
*  Because you're right. There's human sources [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1130.0s)]
*  that the IDF and [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1132.0s)]
*  Shin Bet and others in Israel have [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1134.0s)]
*  within Gaza. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1136.0s)]
*  There's the communications intercepts, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1138.0s)]
*  signals intelligence. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1140.0s)]
*  There's just general surveillance [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1142.0s)]
*  that they're doing of the region [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1144.0s)]
*  in terms of movement of goods. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1146.0s)]
*  But most of that movement of goods happens underground. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1148.0s)]
*  300 [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1150.0s)]
*  maybe, 300 miles of tunnels [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1152.0s)]
*  in Gaza that they've built. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1154.0s)]
*  Using money, by the way. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1156.0s)]
*  Using money that was probably meant for clean [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1158.0s)]
*  water works and other infrastructure [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1160.0s)]
*  and improving schools and hospitals. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1162.0s)]
*  That's a whole [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1164.0s)]
*  different angle to talk about. But [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1166.0s)]
*  I think the security [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1168.0s)]
*  side of things, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1170.0s)]
*  by doing that, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1172.0s)]
*  by limiting who knows about the [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1174.0s)]
*  operation and by, because [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1176.0s)]
*  again, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1178.0s)]
*  you could legitimately argue the political leadership [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1180.0s)]
*  of Hamas, they had a sense. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1182.0s)]
*  You know, I'm sure at some point they approved [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1184.0s)]
*  a large scale operation. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1186.0s)]
*  But the people who [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1188.0s)]
*  really knew about this were [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1190.0s)]
*  the Islamic [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1192.0s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard Corps, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1194.0s)]
*  the IRGC, which is [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1196.0s)]
*  an organization with the Iranian [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1198.0s)]
*  regime. And they're kind of [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1200.0s)]
*  the liaison partners for Hamas [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1202.0s)]
*  and Hezbollah. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1204.0s)]
*  They manage a lot of the training issues. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1206.0s)]
*  They funnel a lot of the money that goes to [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1208.0s)]
*  these organizations that are Iranian proxies. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1210.0s)]
*  And so you can [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1212.0s)]
*  count on the fact that a limited [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1214.0s)]
*  number within the IRGC [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1216.0s)]
*  were aware of the planning and the training [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1218.0s)]
*  because they did train Hamas operatives in [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1220.0s)]
*  Iran prior to 7 October. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1222.0s)]
*  So I think [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1224.0s)]
*  yeah, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1226.0s)]
*  it was simply a matter of them [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1228.0s)]
*  saying, alright, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1230.0s)]
*  this element, this cell will have [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1232.0s)]
*  knowledge of this during the course of [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1234.0s)]
*  training. These guys over here will [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1236.0s)]
*  know this. These people will know this. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1238.0s)]
*  And maybe a handful [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1240.0s)]
*  of people will understand the full picture [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1242.0s)]
*  and will understand when we're going [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1244.0s)]
*  to do this. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1246.0s)]
*  And it's all designed to keep it away from [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1248.0s)]
*  Israeli intelligence. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1252.0s)]
*  And it was [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1254.0s)]
*  ridiculously successful in that regard. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1256.0s)]
*  So, you know, and [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1260.0s)]
*  also you could argue intelligence [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1262.0s)]
*  is a human operation. So [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1264.0s)]
*  they're an endeavor. So you're going to have failures [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1266.0s)]
*  on occasion. You just don't want them to be [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1268.0s)]
*  this massive. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1270.0s)]
*  There [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1272.0s)]
*  were occasional comments [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1274.0s)]
*  about the inclination of [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1276.0s)]
*  Hamas to do something bigger. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1278.0s)]
*  No details, no specific [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1280.0s)]
*  details. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1282.0s)]
*  And Hamas also spent a great [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1284.0s)]
*  deal of time leading [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1286.0s)]
*  up to this, I mean, years, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1288.0s)]
*  convincing [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1290.0s)]
*  the Israeli government [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1292.0s)]
*  through their words, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1294.0s)]
*  through their actions or lack of actions, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1296.0s)]
*  that it was a new day and that [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1298.0s)]
*  what they're looking to do [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1300.0s)]
*  is create [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1302.0s)]
*  a different dynamic or relationship [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1304.0s)]
*  with the Israeli government. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1306.0s)]
*  And so the Israeli government became complacent. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1308.0s)]
*  And when they became complacent [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1310.0s)]
*  to some degree over [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1312.0s)]
*  Hamas and the fact that there hadn't been [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1314.0s)]
*  any strikes or hadn't been any terrorist actions [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1316.0s)]
*  for a period of time, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1318.0s)]
*  then what you saw was [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1320.0s)]
*  then they kind of turned inward. And people talk [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1322.0s)]
*  about the political divisions within Israel [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1324.0s)]
*  and the fact that the government was in a bit of disarray [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1326.0s)]
*  and there was a little dysfunctional [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1328.0s)]
*  a lot of arguments going on. That [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1330.0s)]
*  in part was because [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1332.0s)]
*  they had [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1334.0s)]
*  the, not the luxury, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1336.0s)]
*  but the ability to kind of turn in on themselves because they [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1338.0s)]
*  didn't feel necessarily that that [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1340.0s)]
*  thread outside was as bad as it had [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1342.0s)]
*  been, right, and that they thought perhaps it's diminishing, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1344.0s)]
*  perhaps, you know, Hamas is [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1346.0s)]
*  changing its tune. And [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1348.0s)]
*  that was a deliberate attempt by Hamas [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1350.0s)]
*  to lull them into that state. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1352.0s)]
*  And so there were a lot of things going on at the same [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1354.0s)]
*  time, but yeah, there's no [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1356.0s)]
*  way around it. It's a massive intelligence failure. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1358.0s)]
*  The most cynical and conspiratorial [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1360.0s)]
*  take on it is that they let it [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1362.0s)]
*  happen because this is the best way to destroy [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1364.0s)]
*  Hamas. That they knew it was going to happen [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1366.0s)]
*  so they allowed it to take place. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1368.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty cynical. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1370.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean if [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1374.0s)]
*  you can get your head around that idea that they said [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1376.0s)]
*  yeah, we're going to let Hamas or [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1378.0s)]
*  somehow encourage Hamas to come in [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1380.0s)]
*  and slaughter all these women, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1382.0s)]
*  babies, children, men. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1384.0s)]
*  I suppose that's, you know, if someone can [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1388.0s)]
*  get there, then God bless them, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1390.0s)]
*  that's their right. But [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1392.0s)]
*  I'm not buying it. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1394.0s)]
*  I've seen [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1396.0s)]
*  intelligence failures before. I know it can happen. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1398.0s)]
*  No matter how many cameras you've [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1400.0s)]
*  got up, no matter how good your signals intelligence [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1402.0s)]
*  intercepts are, they dumb that down. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1404.0s)]
*  I'm not calling anybody on the [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1406.0s)]
*  phone because I know you're going to pick that up. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1408.0s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about this anywhere. I'm going to [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1410.0s)]
*  hand a note to my cousin [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1412.0s)]
*  who runs a [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1414.0s)]
*  part of a battalion [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1416.0s)]
*  in Hamas. They got [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1418.0s)]
*  whatever, two dozen battalions. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1420.0s)]
*  But I'm going to keep that communication [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1422.0s)]
*  as stupid as I can. That's what Al Qaeda did. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1424.0s)]
*  And they dumbed it [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1426.0s)]
*  down. And it becomes much [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1428.0s)]
*  more difficult. They limit the number [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1430.0s)]
*  of sources who know about it. That [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1432.0s)]
*  limits your target pool of [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1434.0s)]
*  assets who can tell you something. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1436.0s)]
*  From a human perspective. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1438.0s)]
*  And [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1440.0s)]
*  you know, but again, people [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1442.0s)]
*  are going to, I've seen some pretty [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1444.0s)]
*  wacky conspiracy theories come out of this since [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1446.0s)]
*  7 October. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1448.0s)]
*  And you know, I'm not [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1450.0s)]
*  buying that one. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1452.0s)]
*  Yeah, the most conspiratorial [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1454.0s)]
*  was that Netanyahu [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1456.0s)]
*  was kind of on the way out with [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1458.0s)]
*  the people. And that this is [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1460.0s)]
*  the way for him to [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1462.0s)]
*  sort of galvanize everybody and [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1464.0s)]
*  get support and maintain [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1466.0s)]
*  power. And then do what [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1468.0s)]
*  he actually wanted to do. Go in there and [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1470.0s)]
*  attack Hamas. Yeah. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1472.0s)]
*  Well, it's one theory. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1474.0s)]
*  But [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1476.0s)]
*  whenever you have something this chaotic, you're [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1478.0s)]
*  going to have a bunch of wacky theories. Yeah. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1480.0s)]
*  And you know, I get that. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1482.0s)]
*  Because you have a lot of people who [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1484.0s)]
*  still refuse to believe that [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1486.0s)]
*  Hamas doesn't give a shit about Palestinians. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1488.0s)]
*  And again, I keep going back to the same [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1490.0s)]
*  thing, which is, well, take a look at Gaza. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1492.0s)]
*  And [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1494.0s)]
*  tell me what Hamas [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1496.0s)]
*  has done for the people of [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1498.0s)]
*  Gaza. Because again, Palestinian [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1500.0s)]
*  people aren't lined up 100% behind them. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1502.0s)]
*  In fact, there's been reports [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1504.0s)]
*  of looting of Hamas [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1506.0s)]
*  facilities since they've been losing their grip [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1508.0s)]
*  on power. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1510.0s)]
*  The Hamas leadership structure [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1512.0s)]
*  is enormously wealthy. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1514.0s)]
*  They've stolen billions of dollars [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1516.0s)]
*  that was [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1518.0s)]
*  theoretically intended [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1520.0s)]
*  for Palestinian improvements. Can you explain [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1522.0s)]
*  that? Like, how did they get a hold of the money [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1524.0s)]
*  and how is the money allocated? Like, say, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1526.0s)]
*  where is the money coming from when [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1528.0s)]
*  they get money for the improvements of sanitation [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1530.0s)]
*  and education and schools and [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1532.0s)]
*  all that? It comes from a [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1534.0s)]
*  variety of sources. Look, I think the EU, the [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1536.0s)]
*  European Union, is [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1538.0s)]
*  I think the largest donor still to the [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1540.0s)]
*  Palestinian people. And [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1542.0s)]
*  it comes through various [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1544.0s)]
*  organizations. So [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1546.0s)]
*  the United Nations, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1548.0s)]
*  the refugee office, UNRW, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1550.0s)]
*  the USAID, USAID, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1554.0s)]
*  and some [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1558.0s)]
*  NGOs, well, quite a few NGOs. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1560.0s)]
*  So money is [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1562.0s)]
*  donated or allocated by governments [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1564.0s)]
*  and the US is [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1566.0s)]
*  given billions of dollars [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1570.0s)]
*  through these organizations [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1572.0s)]
*  for the improvement [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1574.0s)]
*  of Palestinian [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1576.0s)]
*  lives, right? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1578.0s)]
*  And part of that came out of the [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1580.0s)]
*  Oslo Accords, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1582.0s)]
*  the idea being, you know, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1584.0s)]
*  band together, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1586.0s)]
*  improve the infrastructure [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1588.0s)]
*  for the Palestinians, create this, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1590.0s)]
*  because that will march towards more [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1592.0s)]
*  stability and eventually maybe that allows [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1594.0s)]
*  for a solution, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1596.0s)]
*  you know, that will eventually [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1598.0s)]
*  come about, whether it's a [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1600.0s)]
*  two-state solution or however it's worked out. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1602.0s)]
*  So that [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1604.0s)]
*  money flows in. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1606.0s)]
*  But since 2007, Hamas [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1608.0s)]
*  controls what goes, it's like when [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1610.0s)]
*  we give money to [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1612.0s)]
*  the Taliban now, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1614.0s)]
*  giving money to the Taliban in Afghanistan. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1616.0s)]
*  And [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1618.0s)]
*  we like to pretend like they're going to use it for good causes. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1620.0s)]
*  We like to pretend we know where it's [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1622.0s)]
*  going or how it's being handled. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1624.0s)]
*  But this money flows [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1626.0s)]
*  into these various organizations [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1628.0s)]
*  and Hamas controls [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1630.0s)]
*  what happens, right? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1632.0s)]
*  So one way or another, they get their [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1634.0s)]
*  hands on that money and they decide what they [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1636.0s)]
*  want to do with it. And for the most part, it has been [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1638.0s)]
*  for the [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1640.0s)]
*  for the betterment of Hamas as [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1642.0s)]
*  an organization, in part because that's what [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1644.0s)]
*  Iran expects them to do. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1646.0s)]
*  And Iran also provides them with funds. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1648.0s)]
*  Not the Palestinian [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1650.0s)]
*  people, Iran directly funds [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1652.0s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1654.0s)]
*  So over the years, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1656.0s)]
*  they have the leadership [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1658.0s)]
*  and particularly the political leadership [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1660.0s)]
*  who all basically [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1662.0s)]
*  live outside of Gaza [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1664.0s)]
*  in Doha and Qatar. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1666.0s)]
*  You know, some reports, and they're confirmed [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1670.0s)]
*  by the US Treasury, it's not just the Israelis [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1672.0s)]
*  saying this, you know, they're [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1674.0s)]
*  billionaires at this stage of life. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1676.0s)]
*  And, you know, one of them's [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1678.0s)]
*  got a couple of kids who are on Instagram. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1680.0s)]
*  And they're flying on [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1682.0s)]
*  private jets and they're, you know, they [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1684.0s)]
*  probably went to the World Cup when it was in Doha. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1686.0s)]
*  And it's [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1688.0s)]
*  it's ludicrous because [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1690.0s)]
*  billions of dollars that literally [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1692.0s)]
*  were meant to provide clean water or [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1694.0s)]
*  better schools or whatever. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1696.0s)]
*  And people just, you know, continue [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1698.0s)]
*  to shake their fists and say it's all Israel's fault. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1700.0s)]
*  How is the money allocated? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1702.0s)]
*  Where does it go? And how does Hamas [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1704.0s)]
*  get their hands on the money? Like, what is [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1706.0s)]
*  what's the expectations when [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1708.0s)]
*  they're giving this money? And [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1710.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't understand. If they know [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1712.0s)]
*  that it's going to Hamas, why are they [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1714.0s)]
*  still sending money? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1716.0s)]
*  Well, in part because [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1718.0s)]
*  that's the purpose. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1720.0s)]
*  So the US funds, say the US [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1722.0s)]
*  says, OK, this year we're giving, whatever, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1724.0s)]
*  $400 million through [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1726.0s)]
*  these various aid organizations. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1728.0s)]
*  Now the aid organizations at some point [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1730.0s)]
*  on the ground, right, have to make [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1732.0s)]
*  a difference, right? They have to. So money [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1734.0s)]
*  has to go somewhere. It has [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1736.0s)]
*  to go to [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1738.0s)]
*  middlemen. It has to go to [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1740.0s)]
*  somebody running a business who's then going [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1742.0s)]
*  to provide [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1744.0s)]
*  resources, whatever that is. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1746.0s)]
*  Grain, something, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1748.0s)]
*  whatever. Transportation, trucking to move things [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1750.0s)]
*  around Gaza, whatever it is. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1752.0s)]
*  And Hamas, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1754.0s)]
*  it's like a criminal gang, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1756.0s)]
*  right? It's like an extortion bracket almost. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1758.0s)]
*  They take their cut. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1760.0s)]
*  They tax [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1762.0s)]
*  the resources [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1764.0s)]
*  that are brought in, right? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1766.0s)]
*  Most of those things have to move. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1768.0s)]
*  The most efficient way to move goods and services [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1770.0s)]
*  through Gaza at this point, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1772.0s)]
*  because of all the work they've done in the tunnels, is the tunnels. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1774.0s)]
*  So they tax goods moving through [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1776.0s)]
*  the tunnels. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1778.0s)]
*  They make their money, right? And I don't want to [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1780.0s)]
*  I'm not equating Hamas necessarily to [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1782.0s)]
*  a mob, but [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1784.0s)]
*  it's kind of what they've been doing. And so [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1786.0s)]
*  now the money that comes from Iran, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1788.0s)]
*  that's a different [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1790.0s)]
*  That's direct to Hamas. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1792.0s)]
*  That's direct to Hamas. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1794.0s)]
*  Again, they take their cut, right? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1796.0s)]
*  But then they spend it, because [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1798.0s)]
*  they're beholden to Iran. They spend it [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1800.0s)]
*  on what they're supposed to, which is [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1802.0s)]
*  more weapons, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1804.0s)]
*  more gear, paying [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1806.0s)]
*  their fighters. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1808.0s)]
*  And so [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1810.0s)]
*  I keep coming back around [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1812.0s)]
*  to this notion that [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1814.0s)]
*  the Palestinian people have been getting screwed [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1816.0s)]
*  left and right. There's no doubt about it, right? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1818.0s)]
*  And [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1820.0s)]
*  civilian casualties [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1822.0s)]
*  are tragic and sad. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1824.0s)]
*  But we live in a very [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1826.0s)]
*  pragmatic world, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1828.0s)]
*  hopefully. I mean, you can't rule [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1830.0s)]
*  this thing by feelings and hope and [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1832.0s)]
*  positivity. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1834.0s)]
*  Hamas chose a certain path, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1836.0s)]
*  and they have to be dealt with. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1838.0s)]
*  Because if you [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1840.0s)]
*  stop and allow them to say, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1842.0s)]
*  OK, well, Hamas is still there. They're still running [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1844.0s)]
*  things. Nothing, nothing changes. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1846.0s)]
*  Doesn't improve the lives of the Palestinians. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1848.0s)]
*  Right? Continues [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1850.0s)]
*  to fuel and fund terror. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1852.0s)]
*  So, OK, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1854.0s)]
*  fine, if you feel better about a ceasefire and [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1856.0s)]
*  kicking the can down the road, but you're not [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1858.0s)]
*  don't pretend like you're solving something. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1860.0s)]
*  So when the money gets [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1862.0s)]
*  allocated, say if there's money that's [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1864.0s)]
*  being sent to Palestine [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1866.0s)]
*  for clean water and all, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1868.0s)]
*  who's receiving that money? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1870.0s)]
*  Well, it goes, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1872.0s)]
*  it's funneled through the organization. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1874.0s)]
*  So like that money is, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1876.0s)]
*  think about it like a bank account. It's deposited with [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1878.0s)]
*  the UN refugee office. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1880.0s)]
*  They decide, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1882.0s)]
*  they allocate [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1884.0s)]
*  because they have essentially vendors, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1886.0s)]
*  right, who are saying, OK, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1888.0s)]
*  we're going to provide, whatever, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1890.0s)]
*  penicillin, or we're going to provide hospital [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1892.0s)]
*  beds. So they're [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1894.0s)]
*  parsing this out to a variety [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1896.0s)]
*  of vendors, both in [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1898.0s)]
*  and outside of [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1900.0s)]
*  the country. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1902.0s)]
*  And there's an attempt to try to [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1904.0s)]
*  ensure that it's Palestinian businesses. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1906.0s)]
*  And Hamas also runs enterprises [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1908.0s)]
*  overseas, right? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1910.0s)]
*  Or sorry, outside of Gaza. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1912.0s)]
*  So they run businesses [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1914.0s)]
*  in Turkey [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1916.0s)]
*  and a variety of other countries. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1918.0s)]
*  So sometimes [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1920.0s)]
*  that money is going to a Hamas-controlled business [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1922.0s)]
*  to then purchase [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1924.0s)]
*  what, theoretically, purchase whatever is necessary. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1926.0s)]
*  We shouldn't imagine that Hamas [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1928.0s)]
*  is, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1930.0s)]
*  they're not like Al-Qaeda. They're not sitting in a cave somewhere. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1932.0s)]
*  They've been doing this for a while. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1934.0s)]
*  And [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1936.0s)]
*  it's [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1938.0s)]
*  a bit like [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1940.0s)]
*  the IRA. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1942.0s)]
*  The IRA started out with a very clear mandate. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1944.0s)]
*  Eventually, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1946.0s)]
*  an element of it was just about drugs and [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1948.0s)]
*  guns and money. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1950.0s)]
*  So [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1952.0s)]
*  I keep coming back around to Hamas. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1954.0s)]
*  They realize they've got a good thing going. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1956.0s)]
*  Stability is not going to [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1958.0s)]
*  keep that gravy train running. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1960.0s)]
*  So, you know, peace with [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1962.0s)]
*  Israel, that [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1964.0s)]
*  cuts off a revenue stream for [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1966.0s)]
*  Hamas, right, in a sense. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1968.0s)]
*  Even though they still, theoretically, they could be [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1970.0s)]
*  smart and they could say, okay, if we have peace [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1972.0s)]
*  with Israel, then we establish a [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1974.0s)]
*  long-term governance thing here. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1976.0s)]
*  Then we can keep that gravy train going. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1978.0s)]
*  But, you know, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1980.0s)]
*  they would lose their funding from Iran [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1982.0s)]
*  because, you know, the last thing Iran wants is [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1984.0s)]
*  peaceful coexistence [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1986.0s)]
*  with Israel. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1988.0s)]
*  And part of this was they looked at [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1990.0s)]
*  the Saudis talking to Israel. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1992.0s)]
*  They looked at the possibility of that meeting [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1994.0s)]
*  that there would be normalized relations with [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1996.0s)]
*  Israel. And [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=1998.0s)]
*  they're just not going to allow that to happen. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2000.0s)]
*  And so, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2002.0s)]
*  and for the time being, it worked, right? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2004.0s)]
*  You've got, I mean, look, you've got [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2006.0s)]
*  what are they, how many members of the Arab [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2008.0s)]
*  League? There's 22 member states [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2010.0s)]
*  in the Arab League and there's maybe half a [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2012.0s)]
*  dozen that recognize Israel. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2014.0s)]
*  Iran doesn't want any more. They certainly [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2016.0s)]
*  don't want the Saudis, right? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2018.0s)]
*  Because that could be a sea change in terms of [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2020.0s)]
*  other countries going, yeah, it doesn't make sense. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2022.0s)]
*  Maybe if we, maybe if we [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2024.0s)]
*  do that, maybe if we normalize relations, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2026.0s)]
*  then maybe [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2028.0s)]
*  that means better [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2030.0s)]
*  prosperity, more stability, economic [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2032.0s)]
*  development. Maybe that's a good thing for our people. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2034.0s)]
*  But [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2036.0s)]
*  again, that would imply [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2038.0s)]
*  that Israel has a right to exist. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2040.0s)]
*  And the Iranian [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2042.0s)]
*  regime draws a line at that. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2044.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2046.0s)]
*  What is the worst case scenario [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2048.0s)]
*  here? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2050.0s)]
*  Uh. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2052.0s)]
*  Um. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2054.0s)]
*  Heh. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2056.0s)]
*  Well, the Biden administration would tell you the worst [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2058.0s)]
*  case scenario is [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2060.0s)]
*  we get into a [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2062.0s)]
*  shooting match with the Iranian regime. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2064.0s)]
*  Right? And again, this is not the Iranian people. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2066.0s)]
*  The Iranian people have an amazing, rich [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2068.0s)]
*  history and [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2070.0s)]
*  you know, they've [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2072.0s)]
*  been under the thumb of the [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2074.0s)]
*  Ayatollah's for all these years. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2076.0s)]
*  I suspect there's a number of [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2078.0s)]
*  them who would like to see a sea change in Iran. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2080.0s)]
*  Right? But I think the, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2082.0s)]
*  you know, from the Biden administration's perspective, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2084.0s)]
*  a regional conflict that expands. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2086.0s)]
*  And not just Hezbollah [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2088.0s)]
*  up north [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2090.0s)]
*  really getting into it. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2092.0s)]
*  And things are heating up up there. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2094.0s)]
*  Right? So it's getting a little testier up there with [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2096.0s)]
*  Hezbollah [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2098.0s)]
*  in Lebanon. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2100.0s)]
*  But a wider [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2102.0s)]
*  conflict than that. Right? And [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2104.0s)]
*  you know, look, the [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2106.0s)]
*  Iranian proxies in [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2108.0s)]
*  Yemen have been, you know, firing [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2110.0s)]
*  their own missiles towards [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2112.0s)]
*  Israel, not with much success. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2114.0s)]
*  But you're getting these little [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2116.0s)]
*  you know, probes there. Iran [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2118.0s)]
*  I think would stop [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2122.0s)]
*  short of being directly involved. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2124.0s)]
*  You know, they've got enough [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2126.0s)]
*  in the way of proxy groups to [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2128.0s)]
*  probably keep this going [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2130.0s)]
*  for some time. But I think the [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2132.0s)]
*  goal here should be [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2134.0s)]
*  yes, not a wider regional conflict. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2136.0s)]
*  But you have [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2138.0s)]
*  to be pragmatic and understand [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2140.0s)]
*  that [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2142.0s)]
*  this is all emanating from, originating [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2144.0s)]
*  from the Iranian regime. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2146.0s)]
*  Right? So [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2148.0s)]
*  if Hamas is [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2150.0s)]
*  sorted out and the conflict [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2152.0s)]
*  as it currently stands [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2154.0s)]
*  ends and you [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2156.0s)]
*  don't get something bigger up north [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2158.0s)]
*  with Hezbollah, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2160.0s)]
*  you still have the Iranian regime sitting here. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2162.0s)]
*  They still have [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2164.0s)]
*  proxies, even if Hamas [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2166.0s)]
*  is degraded. It's not like that's [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2168.0s)]
*  down to zero. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2170.0s)]
*  The problem continues [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2172.0s)]
*  to exist. So [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2174.0s)]
*  the best answer [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2176.0s)]
*  I know you asked about the worst [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2178.0s)]
*  situation, but the best situation [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2180.0s)]
*  would be if the Saudis and other [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2182.0s)]
*  nations [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2184.0s)]
*  in that region [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2186.0s)]
*  would normalize relations with Israel. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2188.0s)]
*  Is that possible now [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2190.0s)]
*  after all this? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2192.0s)]
*  Yeah, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2194.0s)]
*  I think it is. I think it is. I think [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2196.0s)]
*  the Saudis realized that they were [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2198.0s)]
*  going to have to back off [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2200.0s)]
*  for the time being. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2202.0s)]
*  It puts them in an [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2204.0s)]
*  interesting situation. But I do think that [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2206.0s)]
*  they'll look at it in the long term and think, yeah, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2208.0s)]
*  I think we have to [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2210.0s)]
*  move in that direction. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2212.0s)]
*  Who knows how long it could take. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2214.0s)]
*  So you can be hopeful, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2216.0s)]
*  I think, about that. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2218.0s)]
*  But [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2220.0s)]
*  I mean, until, you know, as long [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2222.0s)]
*  as the IRGC [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2224.0s)]
*  and the Iranian regime [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2226.0s)]
*  runs Iran, we're [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2228.0s)]
*  still going to be dealing with this problem. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2230.0s)]
*  It's not going to go away. Now, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2232.0s)]
*  interesting thing. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2234.0s)]
*  I forgot about this. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2236.0s)]
*  The Iranian [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2240.0s)]
*  proxies have launched, I don't [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2242.0s)]
*  know, we're almost at 60. 60 [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2244.0s)]
*  different attacks, right? Drone attacks, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2246.0s)]
*  missile attacks on [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2248.0s)]
*  a variety of US [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2250.0s)]
*  facilities and bases and [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2252.0s)]
*  personnel in Iraq and [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2254.0s)]
*  Syria. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2256.0s)]
*  Since 17 October. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2258.0s)]
*  What is that? So we're going on a month, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2260.0s)]
*  right? A month, and you've had about [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2262.0s)]
*  60 attacks. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2264.0s)]
*  About almost 60 US servicemen injured, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2266.0s)]
*  some seriously. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2268.0s)]
*  And [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2270.0s)]
*  yet [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2272.0s)]
*  I think it was, I think they made the announcement [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2274.0s)]
*  yesterday afternoon during a [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2276.0s)]
*  quiet time in the press room. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2278.0s)]
*  But the [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2280.0s)]
*  Biden administration [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2282.0s)]
*  has agreed to extend [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2284.0s)]
*  a sanction waiver for Iran. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2286.0s)]
*  And we're giving [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2288.0s)]
*  them $10 billion. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2290.0s)]
*  $10 billion in [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2292.0s)]
*  what had been frozen assets [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2294.0s)]
*  owed by Iraq, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2296.0s)]
*  right, to Iran for [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2298.0s)]
*  essentially, for the most part, for [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2300.0s)]
*  electricity, right, for purchasing. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2302.0s)]
*  They get a significant amount of [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2304.0s)]
*  their energy supply from [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2306.0s)]
*  Iran. So Iraq, I think, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2308.0s)]
*  gets almost half [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2310.0s)]
*  or 40, 40%, 45% [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2312.0s)]
*  of their energy supply from Iran. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2314.0s)]
*  So you had $10 billion sitting there, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2316.0s)]
*  frozen assets. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2318.0s)]
*  And so in the past 24 hours, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2320.0s)]
*  despite [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2322.0s)]
*  the Iranian proxies [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2324.0s)]
*  doing this for the past month, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2326.0s)]
*  and before, to be fair, they were [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2328.0s)]
*  launching missiles at some of our [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2330.0s)]
*  facilities in the Middle East [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2332.0s)]
*  before the conflict with Hamas, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2334.0s)]
*  they've decided that [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2338.0s)]
*  a good idea is to release the $10 [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2340.0s)]
*  billion. And [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2342.0s)]
*  it's going to be [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2344.0s)]
*  for humanitarian aid, they say. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2346.0s)]
*  And they won't be able to use it for anything else. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2348.0s)]
*  That's what they tell us. The State Department's [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2350.0s)]
*  very clear on that. They're saying, no, it's just for [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2352.0s)]
*  humanitarian aid. There's no way they can use it [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2354.0s)]
*  for anything else, which is what they said about the [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2356.0s)]
*  $6 billion that they unfroze [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2358.0s)]
*  before [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2360.0s)]
*  this situation kicked off [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2362.0s)]
*  at the beginning of October. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2364.0s)]
*  And, you know, to that, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2366.0s)]
*  the Iranian president said, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2368.0s)]
*  hey, we'll use it for whatever we want [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2370.0s)]
*  to, right? And money's [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2372.0s)]
*  fungible. So [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2374.0s)]
*  if you give me $10 billion and tell me I can [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2376.0s)]
*  only spend it on [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2378.0s)]
*  beer, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2380.0s)]
*  okay, well, I'll take $10 billion [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2382.0s)]
*  that I have over in this pot that I was going to spend [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2384.0s)]
*  on beer, and I'll spend it on ammunition. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2386.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2388.0s)]
*  It's fungible. So [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2390.0s)]
*  it's a ridiculous argument. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2392.0s)]
*  And then the State Department compounded the [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2394.0s)]
*  ridiculous discussion by saying, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2396.0s)]
*  well, I forget who it was. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2398.0s)]
*  It was one of their spokesmen, Miller or somebody. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2400.0s)]
*  He said, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2402.0s)]
*  yeah, look, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2404.0s)]
*  eh, you know, they've been [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2406.0s)]
*  fomenting trouble and creating chaos [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2408.0s)]
*  and causing trouble, I know I'm paraphrasing, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2410.0s)]
*  before [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2412.0s)]
*  this $10 billion. And they're going to keep [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2414.0s)]
*  doing it regardless of whether they get the funds. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2416.0s)]
*  So fine, let's just give [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2418.0s)]
*  them the money. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2420.0s)]
*  They choose to fund destabilizing [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2422.0s)]
*  activities first, he added. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2424.0s)]
*  They always have, as far as we can tell, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2426.0s)]
*  they always will. So when it, looking [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2428.0s)]
*  at this money, we see the benefit [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2430.0s)]
*  to allowing these funds to move again to restricted [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2432.0s)]
*  accounts where they can only benefit [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2434.0s)]
*  the Iranian people. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2436.0s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2438.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2440.0s)]
*  How are these people doing this? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2442.0s)]
*  Yeah, they've decided that... [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2444.0s)]
*  But why would they decide that? That's what I don't understand. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2446.0s)]
*  What's in it for them? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2448.0s)]
*  You know, the optic is awful, right? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2450.0s)]
*  It's not as if the American public's [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2452.0s)]
*  going to look at that and go, yeah, that makes sense. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2454.0s)]
*  We've been reading headlines about these missile and drone strikes [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2456.0s)]
*  caused by Iranian proxies now [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2458.0s)]
*  for the past four weeks. So, sure, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2460.0s)]
*  it makes sense to us that President Biden's decided [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2462.0s)]
*  that this is okay. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2464.0s)]
*  So I don't understand. I'm confused over [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2466.0s)]
*  what they think. And the idea that [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2468.0s)]
*  they somehow imagine that [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2470.0s)]
*  this money won't be used for [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2472.0s)]
*  purposes other than what they're expecting [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2476.0s)]
*  is, I think, is [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2478.0s)]
*  ludicrous. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2480.0s)]
*  But if all you said [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2482.0s)]
*  was just from the optic, even if they [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2484.0s)]
*  could control how [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2486.0s)]
*  that money is spent, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2488.0s)]
*  politically, the optic is awful. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2490.0s)]
*  And so it's a confusing thing from [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2492.0s)]
*  this administration. I don't understand it. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2494.0s)]
*  And it's the wrong... Anyway, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2496.0s)]
*  besides from that, it's the wrong direction. We should be going in the other [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2498.0s)]
*  direction. We should be... [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2500.0s)]
*  Iran has... [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2502.0s)]
*  They have [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2504.0s)]
*  realized, I don't want to say a windfall, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2508.0s)]
*  but [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2510.0s)]
*  their [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2512.0s)]
*  oil revenues [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2514.0s)]
*  have not been [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2516.0s)]
*  degraded. We have not really gone [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2518.0s)]
*  after their energy sector, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2520.0s)]
*  in terms of sanctions. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2522.0s)]
*  And so we should be [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2524.0s)]
*  going after that. We should be really [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2526.0s)]
*  stepping on the gas in terms of saying, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2528.0s)]
*  that's enough, right? I mean, because [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2530.0s)]
*  what have we done? We've had three responses [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2532.0s)]
*  to the missile [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2534.0s)]
*  and drone strikes that they've been responsible [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2536.0s)]
*  for over the past four weeks. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2538.0s)]
*  Three responses. And after every response, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2540.0s)]
*  we just get more missile and drone attacks. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2542.0s)]
*  So it's not deterrence. We're not doing anything to [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2544.0s)]
*  deter the behavior, right? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2546.0s)]
*  We're just... It's almost like a [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2548.0s)]
*  political decision saying, well, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2550.0s)]
*  we got to show the American public we're doing something, and we take it [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2552.0s)]
*  seriously. So let's blow up [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2554.0s)]
*  a weapons depot in eastern [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2556.0s)]
*  Syria. And it's [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2558.0s)]
*  doing nothing to deter the attacks. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2560.0s)]
*  So I don't think giving them 10 [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2562.0s)]
*  billion, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2564.0s)]
*  if maybe that's their calculation, if we [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2566.0s)]
*  give them something, they'll stop. I mean, that's [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2568.0s)]
*  awful. I don't think they're [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2570.0s)]
*  that stupid. So that can't be the reason. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2572.0s)]
*  So I don't understand. It's [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2574.0s)]
*  a confusing decision on their part. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2576.0s)]
*  Does anybody have any sort of [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2578.0s)]
*  rational argument for why they're doing it? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2580.0s)]
*  Not that I've seen, but I mean, I'm going to [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2582.0s)]
*  keep looking. Maybe there is one. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2584.0s)]
*  It'd be nice to think because, look, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2586.0s)]
*  you know, you should want [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2588.0s)]
*  the U.S. government to do well, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2590.0s)]
*  regardless. We got to, you know, at some point [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2592.0s)]
*  you got to say, okay, I don't care whether Democrats or Republicans. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2594.0s)]
*  I just want them to do well because [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2596.0s)]
*  that's good for us, you know, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2598.0s)]
*  in the U.S., [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2600.0s)]
*  whether it's an economic issue [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2602.0s)]
*  or a national security issue. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2604.0s)]
*  So, but I haven't seen [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2606.0s)]
*  a logical argument. It's [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2608.0s)]
*  a new development. They've just basically announced [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2610.0s)]
*  this. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2612.0s)]
*  And, again, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2614.0s)]
*  it makes no sense. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2616.0s)]
*  They were incredibly reluctant [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2618.0s)]
*  at the outset of this [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2620.0s)]
*  conflict [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2622.0s)]
*  to even mention Iran. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2624.0s)]
*  Right? They were very, and in [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2626.0s)]
*  part because they've [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2628.0s)]
*  they've spent three years now [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2632.0s)]
*  with a soft approach, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2634.0s)]
*  right, to trying [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2636.0s)]
*  to get back into a deal of some sort [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2638.0s)]
*  with them over the nuke weapons [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2640.0s)]
*  program. And [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2642.0s)]
*  they've been taking this [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2644.0s)]
*  approach that said, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2646.0s)]
*  well, Trump had maximum pressure, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2648.0s)]
*  so that had to be wrong. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2650.0s)]
*  Had to be wrong. And just like with everything [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2652.0s)]
*  else that Trump did, they just reversed it. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2654.0s)]
*  You know, like the border controls. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2656.0s)]
*  No, that's all bad. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2658.0s)]
*  And so we just have to throw it all out. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2660.0s)]
*  And they kind of did that, and they brought in [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2662.0s)]
*  to their [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2664.0s)]
*  to their various Iran-focused, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2666.0s)]
*  Iran-forward positions, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2668.0s)]
*  whether it's the Pentagon or the State Department, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2670.0s)]
*  they brought in people who were like-minded, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2672.0s)]
*  who wanted a softer approach. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2674.0s)]
*  And [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2676.0s)]
*  that in part was probably driven by an effort [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2678.0s)]
*  by the Iranians, by the IRGC, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2680.0s)]
*  the Islamic Revolutionary [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2682.0s)]
*  Guard Corps, they [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2684.0s)]
*  were running an influence [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2686.0s)]
*  campaign here in the States. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2688.0s)]
*  They've been running it for [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2690.0s)]
*  almost ten years now. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2692.0s)]
*  Where they have [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2694.0s)]
*  worked to discredit any [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2696.0s)]
*  viable [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2698.0s)]
*  opposition to the Iranian regime. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2700.0s)]
*  And they have [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2702.0s)]
*  encouraged [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2704.0s)]
*  and supported [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2706.0s)]
*  the Iran Experts Initiative, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2710.0s)]
*  I think it was called IEI. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2712.0s)]
*  And that [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2714.0s)]
*  was a bunch of academics and others who [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2716.0s)]
*  all believed [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2718.0s)]
*  in the same soft approach to Iran [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2720.0s)]
*  and changing the narrative. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2722.0s)]
*  And that's where you got [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2724.0s)]
*  the US Special Envoy to [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2726.0s)]
*  to Iran in the Biden Administration, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2728.0s)]
*  Robert Malley, who's [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2730.0s)]
*  now suspended, had his security clearance [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2732.0s)]
*  pulled. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2734.0s)]
*  There's no real curious journalist [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2736.0s)]
*  asking where that stands. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2738.0s)]
*  You've got an individual [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2740.0s)]
*  over at the Pentagon who [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2742.0s)]
*  still there, still in [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2744.0s)]
*  their job, and [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2746.0s)]
*  has been promoting, again, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2748.0s)]
*  this idea that we have to [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2750.0s)]
*  change direction with Iran. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2752.0s)]
*  I know I'm kind of [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2756.0s)]
*  wandering down a weird path there, but [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2758.0s)]
*  I guess [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2760.0s)]
*  it's not a surprise. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2762.0s)]
*  It's just an odd decision [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2764.0s)]
*  from the Biden Administration. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2766.0s)]
*  And you would think at this stage of the game, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2768.0s)]
*  if you're not convinced that you need [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2770.0s)]
*  to change course with the Iranian regime [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2772.0s)]
*  and treat them differently, every time we [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2774.0s)]
*  try to shake their hand, they smack it away. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2776.0s)]
*  I don't know how many times that has [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2778.0s)]
*  to happen before the Biden Administration learns [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2780.0s)]
*  that's not the way to deal with them. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2782.0s)]
*  So, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2784.0s)]
*  yeah, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2786.0s)]
*  it's disappearing down a rabbit hole. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2788.0s)]
*  It just doesn't seem like there's any [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2790.0s)]
*  rational [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2792.0s)]
*  solution to this. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2794.0s)]
*  This is what seems so fucked to someone that's watching. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2796.0s)]
*  There's no like, oh, well, hopefully [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2798.0s)]
*  this will happen and it will all work out. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2800.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2804.0s)]
*  This is going to sound weird. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2808.0s)]
*  But I think [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2810.0s)]
*  long-term [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2812.0s)]
*  peace and stability in the Middle East, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2814.0s)]
*  any road [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2816.0s)]
*  you want to take of a serious [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2818.0s)]
*  means to get to long-term [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2820.0s)]
*  stability and peace and prosperity [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2822.0s)]
*  and a better life for [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2824.0s)]
*  whether it's Palestinians or anyone else out there, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2826.0s)]
*  I think that road leads through the Iranian [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2830.0s)]
*  regime, and we have [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2832.0s)]
*  to deal with them. And I don't mean militarily. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2834.0s)]
*  I mean, we have to, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2836.0s)]
*  although, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2838.0s)]
*  if they keep us up, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2840.0s)]
*  I mean, if one of these [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2842.0s)]
*  missiles hits one of these facilities and kills [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2844.0s)]
*  God forbid, a [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2846.0s)]
*  number of US servicemen, then what? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2848.0s)]
*  What the hell are we going to do? We're going to pretend like [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2850.0s)]
*  Iran still has nothing to do with it? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2852.0s)]
*  We're going to unfreeze more assets? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2854.0s)]
*  At some point, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2856.0s)]
*  we've got to have the stones to actually [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2858.0s)]
*  deal with them because it's going to be easier doing that [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2860.0s)]
*  now than when they have a nuke. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2862.0s)]
*  And [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2864.0s)]
*  I'm curious [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2866.0s)]
*  as to what the current administration is [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2868.0s)]
*  thinking about in terms of their policy [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2870.0s)]
*  towards Iran. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2872.0s)]
*  I don't profess to understand [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2874.0s)]
*  it, but I do think that [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2876.0s)]
*  that you can't have [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2878.0s)]
*  stability. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2880.0s)]
*  Every time you're going to get your way towards [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2882.0s)]
*  peace and stability in the Middle East in some [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2884.0s)]
*  fashion, the Iranian regime is going to screw it up [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2886.0s)]
*  because peace and stability means [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2888.0s)]
*  we're talking about Israel. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2890.0s)]
*  And peace and stability, again, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2892.0s)]
*  would imply that means they have a [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2894.0s)]
*  right to exist. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2896.0s)]
*  And every time you get near that, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2898.0s)]
*  then I think the Iranian regime will do whatever [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2900.0s)]
*  they can to stop that from happening. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2902.0s)]
*  So at some point, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2904.0s)]
*  we've got to deal with it. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2906.0s)]
*  And what's the difference [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2908.0s)]
*  between the way this administration handled it [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2910.0s)]
*  and the previous administration? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2912.0s)]
*  I think it was mostly [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2916.0s)]
*  the attention to the sanctions [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2918.0s)]
*  and the economic [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2920.0s)]
*  pressure on them [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2922.0s)]
*  and trying to enforce those sanctions. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2924.0s)]
*  There was, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2928.0s)]
*  again, not touting for [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2930.0s)]
*  the previous administration either, but just saying [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2932.0s)]
*  that their approach was tougher [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2934.0s)]
*  when it came to sanctions. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2936.0s)]
*  Their approach was, we have [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2938.0s)]
*  an adversary here. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2940.0s)]
*  We're not trying to become friends with them right now. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2942.0s)]
*  Because that's not their mindset. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2944.0s)]
*  It's like when [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2946.0s)]
*  someone keeps telling their kid, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2948.0s)]
*  well, look, the bully, just keep putting your hand out [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2950.0s)]
*  and trying to shake his hand and trying to be his friend. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2952.0s)]
*  Maybe he's just misunderstood or he's lacking [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2954.0s)]
*  confidence, and he keeps punching you in the nose. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2956.0s)]
*  At some point, you've got to [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2958.0s)]
*  figure out, okay, I've got to do this. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2960.0s)]
*  You've got to figure out, okay, I've got to do something different here. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2962.0s)]
*  I think the previous administration, they were [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2966.0s)]
*  much tougher on the sanctions. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2968.0s)]
*  And they had [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2970.0s)]
*  an approach, much like with China. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2972.0s)]
*  Yes, they're a competitor, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2976.0s)]
*  but they're an adversary. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2978.0s)]
*  And Xi's got a [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2980.0s)]
*  plan that gets him to the top of the food chain. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2982.0s)]
*  The Iranian regime has a plan [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2984.0s)]
*  that destroys Israel. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2986.0s)]
*  That's their goal. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2988.0s)]
*  That's what it was. I think the Biden administration is more inclined [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2990.0s)]
*  to think that we can all become a community of [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2992.0s)]
*  nations. Unicorns [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2994.0s)]
*  flying out our ass and everybody [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2996.0s)]
*  singing Kumbaya, whatever [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=2998.0s)]
*  the hell that song was. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3000.0s)]
*  So, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3002.0s)]
*  I sound like [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3004.0s)]
*  a cynical asshole. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3006.0s)]
*  No, you sound like someone who actually knows the fuck is going on, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3008.0s)]
*  which is scary. This [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3010.0s)]
*  administration is so goofy. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3012.0s)]
*  They're so weird. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3014.0s)]
*  It's so, I just don't understand [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3016.0s)]
*  any of this. Well, you know what's happening right now [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3018.0s)]
*  while we're talking? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3020.0s)]
*  Biden is sitting down. He might even be [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3022.0s)]
*  right now [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3024.0s)]
*  sitting down with Xi Jinping [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3026.0s)]
*  in San Francisco. Did you see [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3028.0s)]
*  how they cleaned up San Francisco? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3030.0s)]
*  Doesn't it look good? I want to buy a condo [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3032.0s)]
*  there. Isn't that amazing? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3034.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fantastic. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3036.0s)]
*  It's crazy because [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3038.0s)]
*  that city was [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3040.0s)]
*  a shithole. Beautiful, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3042.0s)]
*  beautiful physical setting. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3044.0s)]
*  Great place, but [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3046.0s)]
*  it was a shithole. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3048.0s)]
*  Well, it still is. Still is, yeah. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3050.0s)]
*  Did you hear that, what was it? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3052.0s)]
*  Some news organization [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3054.0s)]
*  from another country got robbed at gunpoint? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3056.0s)]
*  Yeah, camera crew got [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3058.0s)]
*  robbed covering the convention. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3060.0s)]
*  This is APEC conventions there for the week. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3062.0s)]
*  Today is the big day when [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3064.0s)]
*  Xi and Biden sit down and talk. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3066.0s)]
*  And supposedly [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3068.0s)]
*  leading up to this, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3070.0s)]
*  Biden's main point during [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3072.0s)]
*  a press conference was in the climate [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3074.0s)]
*  crisis. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3076.0s)]
*  Like, Xi gives a fuck [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3078.0s)]
*  about the climate. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3080.0s)]
*  So again, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3082.0s)]
*  it all kind of falls together in this [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3084.0s)]
*  world that the current administration is [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3086.0s)]
*  living in. Hey, it'd be lovely if that was the case [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3088.0s)]
*  and that was our biggest issue. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3090.0s)]
*  But I'm hoping that part of this [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3092.0s)]
*  is not [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3094.0s)]
*  that they don't spend a lot of time [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3096.0s)]
*  talking. Although having said that, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3098.0s)]
*  John Kerry was there in San [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3100.0s)]
*  Francisco because he's our climate czar. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3102.0s)]
*  And he proudly [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3104.0s)]
*  announced whenever, yesterday, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3106.0s)]
*  the day before, that part of this [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3108.0s)]
*  meeting will be to [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3110.0s)]
*  agree to a, to [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3112.0s)]
*  resume the climate, whatever it was [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3114.0s)]
*  called, climate working group. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3116.0s)]
*  So the Chinese and Americans will get together [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3118.0s)]
*  now and will be re-energized [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3120.0s)]
*  to talk about, you know, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3122.0s)]
*  how we can both improve the climate. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3124.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, a very, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3126.0s)]
*  very reputable [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3128.0s)]
*  report came out and said that [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3130.0s)]
*  China, the Chinese regime, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3134.0s)]
*  is building six times [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3136.0s)]
*  more coal plants [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3138.0s)]
*  than the rest of the world combined [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3140.0s)]
*  currently. They're basically [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3142.0s)]
*  building two coal plants a week [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3144.0s)]
*  in terms of looking at [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3146.0s)]
*  their construction and the permitting process. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3148.0s)]
*  And, you know, people are saying [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3152.0s)]
*  well, you know, they're trying to find excuses. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3154.0s)]
*  Well, you know, it's because they want to back up, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3156.0s)]
*  you know, look, they're the biggest, you know, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3158.0s)]
*  purveyor of [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3160.0s)]
*  renewable energy. So they just want [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3162.0s)]
*  the coal in case they need a backup. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3164.0s)]
*  And that's bullshit. You know, she looks at [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3166.0s)]
*  coal as a real [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3168.0s)]
*  driver in terms of energy security. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3170.0s)]
*  So anyway, my point being is [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3172.0s)]
*  they're going to sit down, John Kerry [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3174.0s)]
*  spews this crap about, you know, they're going to [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3176.0s)]
*  look at this, we're working together to [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3178.0s)]
*  save the planet. And [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3180.0s)]
*  China is just digging coal [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3182.0s)]
*  as fast as they can. It's, it's, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3184.0s)]
*  I find that part funny because it just [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3186.0s)]
*  shows that we, we're still [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3188.0s)]
*  misunderstanding, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3190.0s)]
*  you know, the CCP and how they [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3192.0s)]
*  operate. It's, it's fantastic. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3194.0s)]
*  But I hope that, I hope they do [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3196.0s)]
*  come to some agreements because again, you want [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3198.0s)]
*  them to, you want the dialogue, you want these two [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3200.0s)]
*  countries talking. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3202.0s)]
*  We don't even have consistent communication right [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3204.0s)]
*  now between the militaries, right? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3206.0s)]
*  I mean, if we get sideways with each other [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3208.0s)]
*  and you need to de-conflict, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3210.0s)]
*  you know, that's, that's a good [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3212.0s)]
*  thing if you have regular consistent [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3214.0s)]
*  conversation between the military command structures. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3216.0s)]
*  We don't have that right now. You would [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3218.0s)]
*  think that the President of the United States and the President [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3220.0s)]
*  of, or the head of China, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3222.0s)]
*  no matter who's in the White [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3224.0s)]
*  House, you would think that we would just [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3226.0s)]
*  be having regularly, you know, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3228.0s)]
*  conversations maybe once a quarter, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3230.0s)]
*  right, between, that [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3232.0s)]
*  would make sense, but we don't do that. I mean, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3234.0s)]
*  it's, it's kind of fucked up. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3236.0s)]
*  So hopefully they come to terms on [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3238.0s)]
*  a couple of things. I'm sure one will be the climate [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3240.0s)]
*  working group. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3242.0s)]
*  They are supposed to come up with an agreement on [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3244.0s)]
*  the use [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3246.0s)]
*  of AI in [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3248.0s)]
*  unmanned weapons systems [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3250.0s)]
*  and in the command [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3252.0s)]
*  and control systems for nuke weapons. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3254.0s)]
*  I don't say nuclear because [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3258.0s)]
*  for some reason that's a tough word and I always get [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3260.0s)]
*  jammed up on nuclear and [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3262.0s)]
*  then people say, you just said nuclear. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3264.0s)]
*  And that's all I get. I get [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3266.0s)]
*  2,000, you know, Twitter [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3268.0s)]
*  messages saying, what the fuck's wrong with you? You can't say nuclear. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3270.0s)]
*  And so I just say nuke now. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3272.0s)]
*  Fuck it, nuclear. Anyway. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3274.0s)]
*  I think a better solution is to stop [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3276.0s)]
*  reading Twitter. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3278.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3280.0s)]
*  Although, although I, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3282.0s)]
*  no, you're right. Actually [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3284.0s)]
*  that is, that is probably, and you've told me [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3286.0s)]
*  that before. Don't, just don't read what [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3288.0s)]
*  people write. It's not good for you. Yeah. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3290.0s)]
*  Although I've been getting a lot of compliments [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3294.0s)]
*  about the President's daily brief. Oh, that's great. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3296.0s)]
*  Yeah. Did I just throw that out there? Yeah. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3298.0s)]
*  Good for you. Yeah. Yeah. It's number one [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3300.0s)]
*  on Spotify news now. Fuck yeah. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3302.0s)]
*  I know. That's awesome. That was my, my primary [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3304.0s)]
*  goal was to beat NPR. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3306.0s)]
*  And we did. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3308.0s)]
*  And now we've done a, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3310.0s)]
*  we're doing an afternoon edition too. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3312.0s)]
*  So you get your PDB [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3314.0s)]
*  in the morning, the President's daily brief [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3316.0s)]
*  and then in the afternoon on your way home [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3318.0s)]
*  or when you're unwinding over [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3320.0s)]
*  a cocktail, you get the afternoon [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3322.0s)]
*  bulletin. And [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3324.0s)]
*  yeah, it's been, it's been a great experience, but [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3326.0s)]
*  I digress. Do you enjoy diving [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3328.0s)]
*  into all this stuff now? Cause you're [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3330.0s)]
*  doing this podcast? I do. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3332.0s)]
*  I mean, I always, I always [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3334.0s)]
*  have, right? So this is just a nice, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3336.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't even, I hate to say it. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3338.0s)]
*  I don't even view it as work [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3342.0s)]
*  or anything, right? It's just because [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3344.0s)]
*  it's interesting and it's the shit that I would be reading [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3346.0s)]
*  and thinking about anyway, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3348.0s)]
*  which means I've got a sad, sad [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3350.0s)]
*  daytime life there. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3352.0s)]
*  Although I've got the world's greatest life, but I think [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3354.0s)]
*  it's, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3356.0s)]
*  yeah, it's [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3358.0s)]
*  a straightforward process. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3360.0s)]
*  The folks that work on it [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3362.0s)]
*  with me, they do a great job. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3364.0s)]
*  We talk in the morning about, you know, what are the [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3366.0s)]
*  topics that we think are going to be the hot ones for the day [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3368.0s)]
*  that we, sorry, that we need to cover [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3370.0s)]
*  the next morning. So we talk about that. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3372.0s)]
*  We put it together. We finalize [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3374.0s)]
*  the morning edition by late in the evening. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3376.0s)]
*  Now we're doing the afternoon bulletin. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3378.0s)]
*  So we're kind of doing the same thing, but in a more [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3380.0s)]
*  shorter view. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3382.0s)]
*  And it's, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3384.0s)]
*  yeah, I just, I enjoy it [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3386.0s)]
*  because I like, for whatever reason, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3388.0s)]
*  you want to know what the hell is going on in the world, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3390.0s)]
*  particularly when it's as fucked up as it is now. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3392.0s)]
*  So you end up kind of [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3394.0s)]
*  diving in, but you don't dive into [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3396.0s)]
*  social media sites, right? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3398.0s)]
*  Don't get your news from there. You get your [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3400.0s)]
*  news from reputable sources [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3402.0s)]
*  if there still are some, but you read a variety [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3404.0s)]
*  of them, so hopefully it balances out. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3406.0s)]
*  And, yeah, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3408.0s)]
*  I spend a ridiculous amount of time, and then [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3410.0s)]
*  my boys, you know, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3412.0s)]
*  Scooter and Sluggo and Mugsy, they have to [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3414.0s)]
*  put up with it, right? They have to listen [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3416.0s)]
*  to me bang on about shit, right? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3418.0s)]
*  So usually if I'm driving one of them [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3420.0s)]
*  to school in the morning, that's when I kind of [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3422.0s)]
*  talk to them about things. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3424.0s)]
*  They're like, oh yeah, I know, exactly. That's what you want [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3426.0s)]
*  when you're a 16 or 12 year old [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3428.0s)]
*  or the middle boy, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3430.0s)]
*  he's still out boarding school at IMG. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3432.0s)]
*  So he doesn't have to listen to me [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3434.0s)]
*  anymore as much. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3436.0s)]
*  But I tell you, that's an operation. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3438.0s)]
*  IMG, fantastic. He's really loved it. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3440.0s)]
*  Not that you asked, but [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3442.0s)]
*  I love talking about him. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3444.0s)]
*  It's an academy. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3446.0s)]
*  It's a boarding school down in Bradenton, Florida. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3448.0s)]
*  And he started there [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3450.0s)]
*  late August, plays [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3452.0s)]
*  basketball, and [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3454.0s)]
*  it started as a tennis [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3456.0s)]
*  program, Nick Boloteri. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3458.0s)]
*  So Augustine and a bunch of folks [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3460.0s)]
*  went there, and they built it up. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3462.0s)]
*  And it's amazing. It's like a D1 campus. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3464.0s)]
*  And they do a great job. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3466.0s)]
*  So he's loving it down there. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3468.0s)]
*  Their weight room's crazy. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3470.0s)]
*  Look at that weight room. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3472.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3474.0s)]
*  That's like a major sports team's weight room. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3476.0s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3478.0s)]
*  It is crazy. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3480.0s)]
*  And their teams, so he's in middle school, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3482.0s)]
*  plays basketball, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3484.0s)]
*  but they're [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3486.0s)]
*  national champions in a variety of sports [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3488.0s)]
*  regularly. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3490.0s)]
*  Their football team looks like Alabama. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3492.0s)]
*  Their high school football team. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3494.0s)]
*  But it's [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3496.0s)]
*  just a good bunch of people. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3498.0s)]
*  And you're giving kids an opportunity. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3500.0s)]
*  A lot of those kids, they just love the sport. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3502.0s)]
*  They're not going to advance to play [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3504.0s)]
*  college ball, because that's [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3506.0s)]
*  a small number. But you give them the [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3508.0s)]
*  opportunity to excel, or to [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3510.0s)]
*  see what excellence looks like. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3512.0s)]
*  And that helps them in a variety of other things. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3514.0s)]
*  And propels [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3516.0s)]
*  them, I think, in life. Because they know, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3518.0s)]
*  I want to get to that point, this is how hard I got to work. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3520.0s)]
*  Now I've got to make the decision, do I do that or not? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3522.0s)]
*  And so they give them that opportunity. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3524.0s)]
*  It's been great. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3526.0s)]
*  And being a part of a structured program makes you [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3528.0s)]
*  realize what's involved in success. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3530.0s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3532.0s)]
*  And if you don't have that, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3534.0s)]
*  that's why you look around [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3536.0s)]
*  sometimes and you think, well, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3538.0s)]
*  if people don't have role models, if they don't [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3540.0s)]
*  have mentors, if they don't have what [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3542.0s)]
*  looks like success, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3544.0s)]
*  well then, maybe it's not a [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3546.0s)]
*  surprise that they're not succeeding. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3548.0s)]
*  And this is a different example. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3550.0s)]
*  I'm not making [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3552.0s)]
*  comparisons there between what [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3554.0s)]
*  happens in inner city and they don't get to [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3556.0s)]
*  see things to that. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3558.0s)]
*  This is a very privileged opportunity [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3562.0s)]
*  that these young folks have. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3564.0s)]
*  And they hopefully [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3566.0s)]
*  feel very fortunate about it. That's the other [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3568.0s)]
*  thing, gratitude. You've got to feel like you [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3570.0s)]
*  appreciate your opportunities. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3572.0s)]
*  But [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3574.0s)]
*  I think I worked on a [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3576.0s)]
*  I worked with a [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3578.0s)]
*  nonprofit for a while in New York [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3580.0s)]
*  City that was focused on education [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3582.0s)]
*  of middle school students. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3584.0s)]
*  And the idea [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3586.0s)]
*  being is that those kids in the city, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3588.0s)]
*  in New York City as an example, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3590.0s)]
*  they make a decision. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3592.0s)]
*  Is education for me? Am I going to stick with it? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3594.0s)]
*  Am I going to high school? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3596.0s)]
*  Make those decisions in middle school. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3598.0s)]
*  And that's [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3600.0s)]
*  a hard cut off for a lot of them. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3602.0s)]
*  If they just get that impression that [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3604.0s)]
*  this is not for me, I'm not going to succeed, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3606.0s)]
*  I'm not going to do it, I don't see any reason for it, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3608.0s)]
*  I don't understand why I'm supposed [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3610.0s)]
*  to go to high school. So [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3612.0s)]
*  the idea was you work with those kids and you [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3614.0s)]
*  give them the opportunity, you show them [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3616.0s)]
*  what success looks like, you show [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3618.0s)]
*  them what opportunity [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3620.0s)]
*  can do for them. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3622.0s)]
*  And you encourage them and [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3624.0s)]
*  they've got to do the work again. They've got to [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3626.0s)]
*  try. But [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3628.0s)]
*  a lot of those kids just don't, they don't have that. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3630.0s)]
*  They've got a mom who's working [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3632.0s)]
*  four jobs. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3634.0s)]
*  Put food on the table, make ends meet. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3636.0s)]
*  They don't have role models that they need. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3638.0s)]
*  So it was a real eye opening experience [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3640.0s)]
*  and a very good one. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3642.0s)]
*  But [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3644.0s)]
*  it was called Citizen Schools. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3646.0s)]
*  And anyway. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3648.0s)]
*  So yeah, so [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3652.0s)]
*  back to your original question, I very much enjoy [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3654.0s)]
*  the President's Daily Brief. It's been [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3656.0s)]
*  a really good experience so far. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3658.0s)]
*  And I think I mentioned [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3660.0s)]
*  that we're number one in news on Spotify. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3662.0s)]
*  Yes, you did mention that. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3664.0s)]
*  I did mention that. Okay. What did you take on? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3666.0s)]
*  Like one of the wildest things that's happened [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3668.0s)]
*  we kind of touched on it briefly, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3670.0s)]
*  is how quickly everybody forgot about Ukraine. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3672.0s)]
*  It just went [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3674.0s)]
*  out of the news. Yeah. It's like the [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3676.0s)]
*  moment Ukraine came along, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3678.0s)]
*  that's when everybody stopped talking about COVID. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3680.0s)]
*  COVID kind of just vanished because [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3682.0s)]
*  now we have a new thing to focus on [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3684.0s)]
*  and virtue signal. That's a good point. Yeah. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3686.0s)]
*  Instantly. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3688.0s)]
*  The pandemic just ended. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3690.0s)]
*  Went away. Went away. We're all good. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3692.0s)]
*  Even with like crazy liberals that are [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3694.0s)]
*  still masking, they kind of eventually took [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3696.0s)]
*  their masks off and said I think we need to just [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3698.0s)]
*  Ukraine is the focus now. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3700.0s)]
*  Have you been on planes lately where you've seen people with [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3702.0s)]
*  masks still? I see them walking down [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3704.0s)]
*  the street. Yeah. In New York City, I saw quite [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3706.0s)]
*  a few people on the street with masks on still. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3708.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3710.0s)]
*  Also in New York City, I was there while the Free [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3712.0s)]
*  Palestine protests were going on. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3714.0s)]
*  Those were wild. And they attacked [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3716.0s)]
*  a UFC bus. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3718.0s)]
*  There's a bus filled with [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3720.0s)]
*  UFC fighters. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3722.0s)]
*  Ruthless Robbie Lawler, the former welterweight [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3724.0s)]
*  champion, Chamal Hill, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3726.0s)]
*  who was the former light heavyweight [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3728.0s)]
*  champion, they're on the bus and [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3730.0s)]
*  they're smashing the windows of the bus and [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3732.0s)]
*  they slash the tires of the bus. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3734.0s)]
*  Why did they [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3736.0s)]
*  target that bus? Wrong time, wrong place. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3738.0s)]
*  They were going through [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3740.0s)]
*  and blocking traffic. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3742.0s)]
*  And the bus tried to make it through before the [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3744.0s)]
*  protesters did. And they just [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3746.0s)]
*  charged the bus and started smashing [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3748.0s)]
*  it and breaking windows. They thought the bus was [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3750.0s)]
*  trying to run them over or something. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3752.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3754.0s)]
*  And you know, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3756.0s)]
*  Robbie Lawler was on the bus [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3758.0s)]
*  and he told everybody to stay calm. He goes [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3760.0s)]
*  we're going to need our energy if we have to fight. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3762.0s)]
*  That is the last fucking [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3764.0s)]
*  dude you want calm and [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3766.0s)]
*  ready to fight. I mean he would have [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3768.0s)]
*  gone out and slaughtered 20 people. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3770.0s)]
*  I was going to say, could you imagine, because you've seen what these [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3772.0s)]
*  protesters look like. Most of them are [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3774.0s)]
*  at best are a buck, right? They're like [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3776.0s)]
*  a bag of milk. Yeah. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3778.0s)]
*  They've been eating a lot of [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3780.0s)]
*  oat milk and [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3782.0s)]
*  veggies. Not that that's a bad thing. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3784.0s)]
*  But they're so confident in numbers. It's so crazy. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3786.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, I was there last week. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3788.0s)]
*  There was a massive protest. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3790.0s)]
*  Not massive, I don't want to overstate it, but there was a big [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3792.0s)]
*  protest outside the New York Public Library. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3794.0s)]
*  And I was [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3796.0s)]
*  walking down, I was heading towards [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3798.0s)]
*  I forget where, Grand Central or something. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3800.0s)]
*  And you could hear the noise start to build. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3802.0s)]
*  You kind of block after block. It gets louder, it gets louder. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3806.0s)]
*  And then there you go and you see it. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3808.0s)]
*  And I was kind of fascinated because I thought, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3810.0s)]
*  okay, well, who is here? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3812.0s)]
*  And there's all these diverse groups, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3814.0s)]
*  right? There's like LGBTQ for free Palestine. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3816.0s)]
*  I'm thinking wild. That's wild. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3819.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3821.0s)]
*  That's crazy. I saw a sign [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3823.0s)]
*  that said Koreans for free Palestine. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3825.0s)]
*  I'm thinking, really? What? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3827.0s)]
*  How did you get roped into this? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3829.0s)]
*  Or was this just like a side hobby of yours? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3831.0s)]
*  You've always loved Palestine? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3833.0s)]
*  And it was [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3835.0s)]
*  an interesting moment. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3837.0s)]
*  But you could also see [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3839.0s)]
*  people, the faces of people walking, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3841.0s)]
*  passing you on the streets. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3843.0s)]
*  And sort of the unease. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3845.0s)]
*  Because it was [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3847.0s)]
*  underlying it, it just seemed hostile. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3849.0s)]
*  And it seemed [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3851.0s)]
*  angry. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3853.0s)]
*  It wasn't a protest out there [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3855.0s)]
*  just like you might normally see [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3857.0s)]
*  for some benign issue. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3859.0s)]
*  This was a little ugly. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3861.0s)]
*  And it shocked people, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3863.0s)]
*  I think. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3865.0s)]
*  Is this organized? And is it organized and funded? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3867.0s)]
*  And if it's organized and funded by who? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3869.0s)]
*  Well, when you look at it, you see [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3871.0s)]
*  lots and lots and lots of graphically [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3873.0s)]
*  well-designed, professionally-produced [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3875.0s)]
*  posters being held up. And then you see, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3877.0s)]
*  occasionally you'll see the one-offs, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3879.0s)]
*  the hand-scrawled Koreans for free Palestine. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3881.0s)]
*  And you see the rows of [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3883.0s)]
*  porta-potties. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3885.0s)]
*  Somebody's putting this together. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3887.0s)]
*  And so somebody's spending money. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3889.0s)]
*  And they're getting permits. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3891.0s)]
*  And they're doing these things. It's not like some random [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3893.0s)]
*  they want you to believe that it's [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3895.0s)]
*  this grassroots thing. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3897.0s)]
*  It's [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3899.0s)]
*  funded and it's organized. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3901.0s)]
*  And [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3903.0s)]
*  where that money is coming from, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3905.0s)]
*  who knows? I'm sure it's coming from a variety [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3907.0s)]
*  of leftist [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3909.0s)]
*  organizations. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3911.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3913.0s)]
*  Maybe some of it's coming from Hamas [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3915.0s)]
*  businesses and organizations. That is [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3917.0s)]
*  exactly what they would do, right? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3919.0s)]
*  Is to promote this. And the [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3921.0s)]
*  Iranians are busy on [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3923.0s)]
*  social media sites doing the same thing. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3925.0s)]
*  Disinformation's everywhere. You can't swing a dead cat [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3927.0s)]
*  without hitting a disinformation campaign. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3929.0s)]
*  Which reminds me that, we'll talk about that later on, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3935.0s)]
*  but the Chinese [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3937.0s)]
*  have been kind of caught with their hand [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3939.0s)]
*  in the cookie jar over a [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3941.0s)]
*  very large scale disinformation campaign. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3943.0s)]
*  Trying to influence [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3945.0s)]
*  policy and decision making [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3947.0s)]
*  and attitudes here in the US. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3949.0s)]
*  But it's [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3951.0s)]
*  what Hamas would do. It's what the Iranians would do [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3953.0s)]
*  with more resource. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3955.0s)]
*  Is to organize [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3957.0s)]
*  these types of things. And ideally, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3959.0s)]
*  again, you want to make them seem spontaneous. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3961.0s)]
*  You want to make them seem... And so, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3963.0s)]
*  and it works. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3965.0s)]
*  You see that on the news. You see, oh my god, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3967.0s)]
*  we got these protests. And you say, well, there's a lot of people [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3969.0s)]
*  against this. And the next thing [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3971.0s)]
*  you know, there's this international pressure. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3973.0s)]
*  And suddenly the White House is talking out of both [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3975.0s)]
*  sides of their mouth. They have unequivocal support [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3977.0s)]
*  for Israel. But I think we might [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3979.0s)]
*  need a pause here. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3981.0s)]
*  We can't do this. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3983.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3985.0s)]
*  That's simply because of the Biden [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3987.0s)]
*  administration looks out there. They make a political [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3989.0s)]
*  calculation. They see all these protests [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3991.0s)]
*  here in the US. I mean, the college [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3993.0s)]
*  campuses. They've got a 2024 [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3995.0s)]
*  election coming up. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3997.0s)]
*  They don't want to lose the Arab American vote. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=3999.0s)]
*  They certainly don't want to lose the youth [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4001.0s)]
*  vote. So what do they got to do? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4003.0s)]
*  They got to pivot a little bit. They got to start talking about [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4005.0s)]
*  ceasefire or long pause. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4007.0s)]
*  Or, you know, by god, don't be firing up [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4009.0s)]
*  a hospital or whatever. Yeah, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4011.0s)]
*  no shit, Sherlock. I think the IDF knows [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4013.0s)]
*  not to, you know, go in [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4015.0s)]
*  full bore inside [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4017.0s)]
*  a hospital. Right? I think they're going to be a little more [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4019.0s)]
*  strategic than that. But the White House does [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4021.0s)]
*  it for. So they're basically driving [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4023.0s)]
*  foreign policy [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4025.0s)]
*  because of US [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4027.0s)]
*  domestic political concerns. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4029.0s)]
*  What's going to happen in the 2024 election? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4031.0s)]
*  So I don't think that's necessarily a good way [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4033.0s)]
*  to run foreign policy. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4035.0s)]
*  What is the China thing? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4037.0s)]
*  You're saying China got caught with their hand in the cookie jar? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4039.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It's another [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4041.0s)]
*  good thing. It'd be nice if Biden would [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4043.0s)]
*  mention this to Xi when they're sitting down, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4045.0s)]
*  which they are. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4047.0s)]
*  But [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4049.0s)]
*  they called it [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4051.0s)]
*  spam-aflash. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4053.0s)]
*  Or I think it had a code name [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4055.0s)]
*  of Dragon Bridge. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4057.0s)]
*  And the idea was [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4059.0s)]
*  the Chinese Communist Party, through their ministry [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4061.0s)]
*  of public security, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4063.0s)]
*  is running a large [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4065.0s)]
*  scale [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4067.0s)]
*  disinformation campaign. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4069.0s)]
*  And part of it is targeted at [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4071.0s)]
*  Chinese dissidents. So part of it is targeted [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4073.0s)]
*  here in the States at [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4075.0s)]
*  Chinese journalists and activists and others [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4077.0s)]
*  who speak out against Xi and the regime. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4079.0s)]
*  And so the idea being is that they [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4081.0s)]
*  basically hunt these people down [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4083.0s)]
*  online. They troll them. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4085.0s)]
*  They overwhelm their message by [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4087.0s)]
*  using thousands and thousands of accounts [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4089.0s)]
*  that they've set up in these farms. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4091.0s)]
*  Most of this is run out of Beijing. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4093.0s)]
*  And the idea being they're just basically [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4097.0s)]
*  either trying to push down the activist [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4099.0s)]
*  voice, right, and [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4101.0s)]
*  create a better, more positive narrative for Xi. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4103.0s)]
*  Or in some cases, they're actually [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4105.0s)]
*  trying to find them, right, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4107.0s)]
*  and influence them [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4109.0s)]
*  directly. And so there was that story [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4111.0s)]
*  about New [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4113.0s)]
*  York City, that [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4115.0s)]
*  these secret police stations, that the [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4117.0s)]
*  ministry of public security, the Chinese [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4119.0s)]
*  Communist Party's ministry of public security, was [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4121.0s)]
*  running here in the States, and still continue to [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4123.0s)]
*  run, frankly. But they had a couple of their MPS [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4125.0s)]
*  agents here in New York, or in [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4127.0s)]
*  New York, and part of [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4129.0s)]
*  what they were doing was [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4131.0s)]
*  dealing directly with activists, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4133.0s)]
*  basically threatening them, harassing [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4135.0s)]
*  them, and [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4137.0s)]
*  trying to, again, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4139.0s)]
*  shut them up. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4141.0s)]
*  They've [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4143.0s)]
*  done other things, too. I mean, they were involved in [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4145.0s)]
*  spreading messages related [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4147.0s)]
*  to the [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4149.0s)]
*  George Floyd protests. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4151.0s)]
*  So they've got evidence, and this is [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4153.0s)]
*  a report that [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4155.0s)]
*  who did this, CNN, I think, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4157.0s)]
*  put this together after studying a [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4159.0s)]
*  vast amount of documentation, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4161.0s)]
*  right, and information [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4163.0s)]
*  that was foiled and brought out from [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4165.0s)]
*  a variety of places, and also from [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4167.0s)]
*  social media sites that pulled together their own [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4169.0s)]
*  research. So George [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4171.0s)]
*  Floyd protests, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4173.0s)]
*  and then the second year of that, they're still [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4175.0s)]
*  promoting it, and the idea is they're pushing out [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4177.0s)]
*  narratives that say, you know, [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4179.0s)]
*  America is a completely racist society, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4181.0s)]
*  you know, and democracy doesn't [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4183.0s)]
*  work, and, you know, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4185.0s)]
*  that's exactly what you would expect them to do, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4187.0s)]
*  but it's on a [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4189.0s)]
*  scale that I don't think [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4191.0s)]
*  we understood completely, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4193.0s)]
*  right, and the US government has just come out [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4195.0s)]
*  basically and felt like they had, and I think [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4197.0s)]
*  Metta was also involved in the [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4199.0s)]
*  research, and they've come out and talked about it [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4201.0s)]
*  and said, yeah, this is a [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4203.0s)]
*  problem. Now, whether Biden talks [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4205.0s)]
*  to them about that or not, I don't know, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4207.0s)]
*  but the other thing they do is that they came out [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4209.0s)]
*  and identified, but we talked about this before, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4211.0s)]
*  is, you know, the Chinese regime [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4213.0s)]
*  using this disinformation campaign, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4215.0s)]
*  this spam of flash or whatever, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4217.0s)]
*  some of the specific [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4219.0s)]
*  examples where they went after a [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4221.0s)]
*  Texas-based [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4223.0s)]
*  Rare Earths [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4225.0s)]
*  processing facility, right, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4227.0s)]
*  so basically [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4229.0s)]
*  working to [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4231.0s)]
*  shut that down, essentially, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4233.0s)]
*  right, to get the voices in the [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4235.0s)]
*  community against this, and how do they [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4237.0s)]
*  do that? Well, they [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4239.0s)]
*  promote, they sponsor, they [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4241.0s)]
*  encourage [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4243.0s)]
*  environmental groups and activist groups, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4245.0s)]
*  and so, you know, it's not as [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4247.0s)]
*  again, it's not as if [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4249.0s)]
*  people want to make a direct connection and say, are you [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4251.0s)]
*  telling me that Greenpeace is taking money from the [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4253.0s)]
*  CCP? And no, it's more sophisticated than [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4255.0s)]
*  that, right, but they are doing that. They are [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4257.0s)]
*  promoting these environmental activist groups [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4259.0s)]
*  to basically push that [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4261.0s)]
*  message that mining's bad, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4263.0s)]
*  right, you don't want to go after Rare Earth [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4265.0s)]
*  minerals because that's bad for the earth, right, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4267.0s)]
*  certainly not processing, and [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4269.0s)]
*  so, meanwhile, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4271.0s)]
*  they have a fucking monopoly on the whole thing, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4273.0s)]
*  right, but they've been doing that for years, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4275.0s)]
*  right, and they know, and so what they've [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4277.0s)]
*  realized relatively [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4279.0s)]
*  early on was [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4281.0s)]
*  even more so than going out [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4283.0s)]
*  and locking up mining rights overseas, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4285.0s)]
*  right, if you're talking about, you know, the [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4287.0s)]
*  Congo, you're talking about [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4289.0s)]
*  Australia, South America, you know, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4291.0s)]
*  for lithium, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4293.0s)]
*  then even more [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4295.0s)]
*  important was impacting [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4297.0s)]
*  your main competitors' regulatory [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4299.0s)]
*  policies, right, and so [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4301.0s)]
*  they understood that if they [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4303.0s)]
*  can encourage, right, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4305.0s)]
*  local and city councils, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4307.0s)]
*  state governments, and the federal government [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4309.0s)]
*  to, and [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4311.0s)]
*  they really focus on local and [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4313.0s)]
*  state because that's an easier [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4315.0s)]
*  lift, right, go on changing federal policy [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4317.0s)]
*  can, they probably got tired of the bureaucracy, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4319.0s)]
*  but they [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4321.0s)]
*  understood that if they can do that [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4323.0s)]
*  to enact [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4325.0s)]
*  anti-mining [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4327.0s)]
*  regulations, you know, you can't explore, you know, it's going to take you [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4329.0s)]
*  ten years to get a permit to explore for [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4331.0s)]
*  lithium, you know, in Nevada [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4333.0s)]
*  or Idaho or wherever, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4335.0s)]
*  that's [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4337.0s)]
*  right in line with their strategy to [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4339.0s)]
*  become the provider [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4341.0s)]
*  of rare [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4343.0s)]
*  earth and critical minerals because [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4345.0s)]
*  they also understood, they're smart enough, they've got [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4347.0s)]
*  a long fizz in here, and they look [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4349.0s)]
*  at the US, they look at Europe, and we're all [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4351.0s)]
*  self-righteously banging on about how we're [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4353.0s)]
*  going to, it's all electric, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4355.0s)]
*  nothing but electric, we're getting off this [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4357.0s)]
*  fossil fuels. So they look at that [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4359.0s)]
*  and go, great, well, we're [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4361.0s)]
*  on top of that, right, we're going to be in charge [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4363.0s)]
*  of that market. So [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4365.0s)]
*  that's what they've been doing, and they go [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4367.0s)]
*  after these local governments and they [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4369.0s)]
*  encourage through the spammer flage or whatever, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4371.0s)]
*  and also again in supporting environmental groups [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4375.0s)]
*  to push this, right, and create this [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4377.0s)]
*  groundswell, and some guy in a city council is looking [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4379.0s)]
*  and going, oh yeah, I'm not approving that [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4381.0s)]
*  phosphate mining [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4383.0s)]
*  exercise, right, I'm not approving [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4385.0s)]
*  that, whatever, and [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4387.0s)]
*  you know, you can't have agriculture [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4389.0s)]
*  really without phosphate for fertilizer, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4391.0s)]
*  so that's a pretty important thing. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4393.0s)]
*  But some city councilman, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4395.0s)]
*  he's not going to sit there and go, well, I [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4397.0s)]
*  think this is probably, you know, maybe [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4399.0s)]
*  sponsored by the CCP, and he [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4401.0s)]
*  just hears some environmentalists come to [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4403.0s)]
*  the city council meetings and, you know, protest [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4405.0s)]
*  or make an argument, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4407.0s)]
*  and he thinks, yeah, I'm voting against [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4409.0s)]
*  it, right, it's good for the earth, now I get to [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4411.0s)]
*  feel good about myself too. So anyway, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4413.0s)]
*  those are the sort of things that [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4415.0s)]
*  take place, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4417.0s)]
*  that, you know, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4419.0s)]
*  again, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4421.0s)]
*  do most people think about [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4423.0s)]
*  that sort of shit? No, I don't think so, [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4425.0s)]
*  right, but it's what makes the [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4427.0s)]
*  world go round, right, everything's interconnected, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4429.0s)]
*  and so shit doesn't happen without a [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4431.0s)]
*  reason, so when you ask, you [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4433.0s)]
*  know, are these protests sponsored, who's [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4435.0s)]
*  paying for them, that's a great [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4437.0s)]
*  fucking question for journalists to [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4439.0s)]
*  dig into, right, if they were curious enough. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4441.0s)]
*  You know, I don't think they are, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4443.0s)]
*  but it would make an interesting story, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4445.0s)]
*  and if someone did [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4447.0s)]
*  that, yeah, maybe they, you know, get an [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4449.0s)]
*  award, I don't know. Well, at [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4451.0s)]
*  least it should be discussed [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4453.0s)]
*  to the point where it's a narrative [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4455.0s)]
*  where the general [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4457.0s)]
*  public is aware of it, and Congress [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4459.0s)]
*  is aware the general public is aware of it, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4461.0s)]
*  so this is something that's on the [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4463.0s)]
*  table, you can't just openly say, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4465.0s)]
*  we can't mind because of this, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4467.0s)]
*  environmental groups have said that, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4469.0s)]
*  there should be some discussion, like, hey, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4471.0s)]
*  why are they saying that, what's [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4473.0s)]
*  funding that, and if you look at the [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4475.0s)]
*  funding, oh look, it's tied to China, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4477.0s)]
*  oh look, they're running cobalt [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4479.0s)]
*  mines in the Congo, oh look, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4481.0s)]
*  they're the ones who are doing all [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4483.0s)]
*  of these rare earth mineral mines, they have [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4485.0s)]
*  a monopoly on this business, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4487.0s)]
*  they don't want us doing it [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4489.0s)]
*  for business reasons, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4491.0s)]
*  and then also, they are the [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4493.0s)]
*  providers of that, the more we buy [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4495.0s)]
*  electric, the more they [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4497.0s)]
*  sell these minerals, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4499.0s)]
*  yeah, I mean, they've got a lock on [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4501.0s)]
*  processing, it's a [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4503.0s)]
*  but you have to admire the fact [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4505.0s)]
*  that they've thought this [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4507.0s)]
*  through, and they kind of [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4509.0s)]
*  went soup to nuts, they started the process [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4511.0s)]
*  to the finish, alright, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4513.0s)]
*  what do we do, how do we control it? I never understood [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4515.0s)]
*  that term, soup to nuts. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4517.0s)]
*  What is that term? [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4519.0s)]
*  Do you get it, Jamie? Have you ever [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4521.0s)]
*  understood it? Can we look up the [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4523.0s)]
*  origin of soup to nuts? When you [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4525.0s)]
*  say it, I know what you're saying, but I'm like [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4527.0s)]
*  where the fuck did that come from? It's derived from the description [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4529.0s)]
*  of a full course dinner. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4531.0s)]
*  Really? So you start with soup when you finish [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4533.0s)]
*  with nuts. Who finishes with nuts? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4535.0s)]

*  Soup to Nuts. Ah, the Three Stooges, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4543.0s)]
*  I love the Three Stooges. All roads lead to the Three [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4545.0s)]
*  Stooges. But only Curly. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4547.0s)]
*  Yeah, Curly's the best. No, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4549.0s)]
*  that'd be Curly. I was not [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4551.0s)]

*  They'll pretend that they like the Three Stooges. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4563.0s)]
*  But no woman out there, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4565.0s)]
*  nobody likes [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4567.0s)]
*  the Three Stooges. She's on the female side. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4569.0s)]
*  But if they're dating you, they'll [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4571.0s)]
*  pretend to like the Three Stooges. I know. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4573.0s)]
*  I think she's not wrong. They don't have to do that. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4575.0s)]
*  I think she's not wrong. I don't want anybody to [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4577.0s)]
*  pretend that they like anything. Yeah, no. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4579.0s)]
*  If a woman was pretending [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4581.0s)]
*  she liked things, I'd start thinking maybe this lady's [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4583.0s)]
*  pretending she likes me. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4585.0s)]
*  This could be a fucking full on scam. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4587.0s)]
*  Where does this end? Yeah, where does this deception [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4589.0s)]
*  end? Oh, God. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4591.0s)]
*  Tell me you think the Three Stooges suck. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4593.0s)]
*  We could still get along. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4595.0s)]
*  No one has to like... [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4597.0s)]
*  But not Curly. Curly doesn't suck. Yeah, he doesn't suck. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4599.0s)]
*  No one has to like what [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4601.0s)]
*  I like. I never understood [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4603.0s)]
*  that. Yeah. Imagine dating someone [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4605.0s)]
*  and they have to like everything you like. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4607.0s)]
*  Oh, God. No. No. My wife was [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4609.0s)]
*  getting up in the morning like, when are we bow hunting? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4611.0s)]
*  Oh, no shit. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4613.0s)]
*  Oh, that's [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4615.0s)]
*  right. He did. That's right. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4617.0s)]
*  That's where I heard it recently. Mark [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4619.0s)]
*  Norman, the fucking man. But we go [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4621.0s)]
*  back to the same question. Who finishes a meal with nuts? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4623.0s)]
*  Yeah. Have you ever done that? Never. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4625.0s)]
*  Anybody want some nuts? Never. No. Nuts [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4627.0s)]
*  are something you eat for a snack. You start [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4629.0s)]
*  maybe. Maybe you start. You have a drink [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4631.0s)]
*  before you sit down at dinner. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4633.0s)]
*  Sure. And maybe there's some nuts. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4635.0s)]
*  No. There's a lot of... [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4637.0s)]
*  Was that a thing they did back in the day? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4639.0s)]
*  Nuts was dessert? [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4641.0s)]
*  I think that was it. Yeah. Maybe you had nuts in a cheese [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4643.0s)]
*  plate. I think you finish with cheese [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4645.0s)]
*  too. That's also odd. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4647.0s)]
*  It is odd because you've got a full meal [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4649.0s)]
*  and then somebody brings you a big wheel of cheese [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4651.0s)]
*  and you're supposed to put that down. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4653.0s)]
*  Isn't that something also that you have [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4655.0s)]
*  like on a charcuterie board? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4657.0s)]
*  That's like the beginning of the meal. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4659.0s)]
*  Well, appetizer. Is it charcuterie [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4661.0s)]
*  or charcuterie? I don't know. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4663.0s)]
*  I never know what to say. This is the sort [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4665.0s)]
*  of thing that I may have to dig into. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4667.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4669.0s)]
*  Just look at this. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4671.0s)]
*  So anyway, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4673.0s)]
*  that's the spam of laws. That's the Dragon [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4675.0s)]
*  Bridge program that the Chinese were [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4677.0s)]
*  running or are running. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4679.0s)]
*  They must still be running. But are we running [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4681.0s)]
*  something like that too? We have to be. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4683.0s)]
*  It would be kind of irresponsible if the government [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4685.0s)]
*  of the United States knew that all [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4687.0s)]
*  these other countries were involved in propaganda [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4689.0s)]
*  against us and we weren't doing the same. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4691.0s)]
*  I don't disagree. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4693.0s)]
*  Probably the best example would be [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4695.0s)]
*  Voice of America, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4697.0s)]
*  right? Back during the Cold War days. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4699.0s)]
*  The whole point of that exercise was [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4701.0s)]
*  to change hearts and minds, convince [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4703.0s)]
*  people behind the wall that [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4705.0s)]
*  democracy was the [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4707.0s)]
*  bee's knees. Can we look that up too? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4709.0s)]
*  The bee's knees? [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4711.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4713.0s)]
*  All the bells and whistles was coming [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4715.0s)]
*  up too, but I don't know where that came from. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4717.0s)]
*  All the bells and whistles. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4719.0s)]
*  That seems like just like, oh, everything's [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4721.0s)]
*  crazy. Yeah. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4723.0s)]
*  Running up the flagpole. See who salutes. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4725.0s)]
*  We got a million of them, but let's not. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4727.0s)]
*  So, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4729.0s)]
*  I completely forgot what [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4731.0s)]
*  the fuck we were talking about. Whether or not we're running [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4733.0s)]
*  some sort of a propaganda campaign as well [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4735.0s)]
*  than we have to be. Yeah. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4737.0s)]
*  Does that ever happen to you though where you just, in a [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4739.0s)]
*  second, you've forgotten what it is that you were just [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4741.0s)]
*  talking about? Oh yeah. Yeah. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4743.0s)]
*  I worry about that sometimes. I worry like, okay, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4745.0s)]
*  I'm advanced age and [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4747.0s)]
*  should I be paying attention to this? [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4749.0s)]
*  You can mitigate that with Neutropics. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4751.0s)]
*  Do you ever take Neutropics? No. What's that? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4753.0s)]
*  Neutropics are new. Do we have any [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4755.0s)]
*  around here? Neutropics. Yeah, here. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4757.0s)]
*  Alpha Brain. This is my favorite. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4759.0s)]
*  This is Alpha Brain Black Label. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4761.0s)]
*  This is the stuff that I take. If [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4763.0s)]
*  ever I'm going to talk to like a scientist. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4765.0s)]
*  Well, I take it for most podcasts. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4767.0s)]
*  I didn't take it today. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4769.0s)]
*  But I take it for most. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4771.0s)]
*  I take it when I'm talking to a smart guy. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4773.0s)]
*  I just did. I'm just being honest. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4775.0s)]
*  I didn't take it today. No, I appreciate that. But most of the times I [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4777.0s)]
*  take it. I wouldn't want you to pretend [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4779.0s)]
*  that I'm smart. No, I wouldn't take it for you. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4781.0s)]
*  Then I got to wonder, do you actually like me or not? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4783.0s)]
*  Listen, I came right out of the gym and walked [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4785.0s)]
*  right in here. That is true. So it's like [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4787.0s)]
*  I'm already energized, jazzed up. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4789.0s)]
*  We already did the sauna. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4791.0s)]
*  So I'm fired up. How hot is [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4793.0s)]
*  that sauna? Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Is it [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4795.0s)]
*  true because my wife always says, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4797.0s)]
*  don't do the sauna. I mean, [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4799.0s)]
*  because I've had some heart issues. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4801.0s)]
*  And so [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4803.0s)]
*  but is that true? Sauna is bad for [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4805.0s)]
*  someone with a heart condition? I don't believe it is. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4807.0s)]
*  I think you could probably overtax [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4809.0s)]
*  yourself in the sauna just like you could overtax [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4811.0s)]
*  yourself with extreme cardiovascular working out. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4813.0s)]
*  But what the sauna does do [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4815.0s)]
*  for sure is elevate your heart rate. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4817.0s)]
*  But what it's essentially like, it's like doing [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4819.0s)]
*  static cardio. What I [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4821.0s)]
*  would say is someone who has a heart condition, [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4823.0s)]
*  definitely speak to a physician, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4825.0s)]
*  definitely talk to your doctor about it. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4827.0s)]
*  What does it say here? Can individuals with a heart [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4829.0s)]
*  condition use a sauna and is it dangerous? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4831.0s)]
*  While the use of a sauna is considered safe for most [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4833.0s)]
*  individuals, exceptions for those with unstable [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4835.0s)]
*  heart disease. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4837.0s)]
*  For individuals with any of the [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4839.0s)]
*  following conditions, it may not be safe. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4841.0s)]
*  Unstable angina [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4843.0s)]
*  pectoris. Do you have that? [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4845.0s)]
*  So let's see what the heart diseases are. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4847.0s)]
*  But I think these are people that are like ready to die. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4851.0s)]
*  Yeah. Recent heart [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4853.0s)]
*  attack within two weeks. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4855.0s)]
*  Uncontrolled hypertension, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4857.0s)]
*  decompensated heart failure, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4859.0s)]
*  and severe aortic stenosis. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4861.0s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think it's bad for you. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4863.0s)]
*  This is what it does. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4865.0s)]
*  First of all, the benefits of it are vast. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4867.0s)]
*  There was a study out of Finland that showed [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4869.0s)]
*  that 20 years, they did this [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4871.0s)]
*  long term study, people who [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4873.0s)]
*  use the sauna four times a week [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4875.0s)]
*  experienced a 40% decrease [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4877.0s)]
*  in all cause mortality. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4879.0s)]
*  40% decrease in stroke, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4881.0s)]
*  heart attacks, cancer, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4885.0s)]
*  everything. And the reason [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4887.0s)]
*  for that is heat shock proteins. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4889.0s)]
*  What happens when you're in the sauna, [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4891.0s)]
*  you can't stay [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4893.0s)]
*  in there. You can only stay in there for a short [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4895.0s)]
*  amount of time. So you do 20 minutes. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4897.0s)]
*  And what happens during that 20 minutes is [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4899.0s)]
*  your body is freaking out because it's 185 [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4901.0s)]
*  degrees in there, and you're sweating [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4903.0s)]
*  and your heart is pounding, and you develop [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4905.0s)]
*  static cardio. So your heart [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4907.0s)]
*  rate, many times when [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4909.0s)]
*  I do it, I go straight from working [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4911.0s)]
*  out, my heart rate's already elevated, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4913.0s)]
*  and I climb right into 185 [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4915.0s)]
*  degrees, my heart rate stays elevated. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4917.0s)]
*  And it gets as high as 150 [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4919.0s)]
*  beats per minute sometimes. Especially [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4921.0s)]
*  if I'm doing like heavy duty cardio [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4923.0s)]
*  and then I jump right into the sauna, it's [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4925.0s)]
*  rough. But it extends [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4927.0s)]
*  your cardiovascular output, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4929.0s)]
*  and it creates heat shock proteins. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4931.0s)]
*  And heat shock proteins reduce [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4933.0s)]
*  inflammation throughout the body. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4935.0s)]
*  There's amazing benefits [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4937.0s)]
*  for the sauna. Does it, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4939.0s)]
*  what's that word, dilute blood vessels? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4941.0s)]
*  Does it constrict? I don't think [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4943.0s)]
*  so. Why would it constrict? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4945.0s)]
*  I don't know, I was just asking. Cardio doesn't [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4947.0s)]
*  constrict, so I don't think it would constrict. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4949.0s)]
*  I'm just asking. You just have to make sure [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4951.0s)]
*  A, you're hydrated, you [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4953.0s)]
*  have to take electrolytes, which I do, I take [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4955.0s)]
*  a lot of electrolytes, and I stay [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4957.0s)]
*  hydrated. And then you get in there, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4959.0s)]
*  and you're essentially, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4961.0s)]
*  you know, you're [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4963.0s)]
*  treating your body in a way that [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4965.0s)]
*  your body, it's not sustainable, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4967.0s)]
*  right? So your body knows, like, oh my god, I'm [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4969.0s)]
*  gonna fucking die if this guy stays in here. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4971.0s)]
*  And so that process of your body [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4973.0s)]
*  compensating for that heat creates these heat shock [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4975.0s)]
*  proteins. And these heat shock [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4977.0s)]
*  proteins are amazing [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4979.0s)]
*  at reducing inflammation in your body. You feel [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4981.0s)]
*  great when you get out of there. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4983.0s)]
*  You just feel loose and relaxed, and [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4985.0s)]
*  there's an overall sense of wellness and [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4987.0s)]
*  well-being. It's just really good for you. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4989.0s)]
*  I always liked the sauna, it was never as [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4991.0s)]
*  aggressive as, you know, the [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4993.0s)]
*  protocol that you go through, but [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4995.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you don't have to do that. You could do [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4997.0s)]
*  160, 160 for 15 [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=4999.0s)]
*  minutes, one, two, it just, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5001.0s)]
*  anytime you can get into the [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5003.0s)]
*  sauna and get those heat shock proteins, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5005.0s)]
*  it's good for your body. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5007.0s)]
*  And if you're worried about your heart, just don't do it so [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5009.0s)]
*  hot. Just do it 160, [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5011.0s)]
*  and do it for 15 minutes, and [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5013.0s)]
*  build up. Build yourself up to it. But it's [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5015.0s)]
*  great for your overall health. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5017.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's, I mean, I've been meaning to [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5019.0s)]
*  mention it to my [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5021.0s)]
*  cardiologist, but I'm too [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5023.0s)]
*  disorganized. What is the issue with [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5025.0s)]
*  your heart? You know, I was, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5027.0s)]
*  I think I ever told you, I was on a [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5029.0s)]
*  plane, boarded a plane with [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5031.0s)]
*  my wife. We were going [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5033.0s)]
*  to Puerto Rico. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5035.0s)]
*  So we went through Dallas, Fort Worth. So we [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5037.0s)]
*  get on the plane to go from DFW to Puerto Rico. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5039.0s)]
*  And we're taxiing. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5041.0s)]
*  We're basically gotten to the runway, and now [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5043.0s)]
*  they're turning onto the runway, they're [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5045.0s)]
*  ready to wind the engines up. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5047.0s)]
*  And I'm just sitting there, and I look at her, and I [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5049.0s)]
*  say, you know, I don't feel that [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5051.0s)]
*  and that's where I went [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5053.0s)]
*  out. And I had what they called a [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5055.0s)]
*  widow maker. Oh, you told me about this. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5057.0s)]
*  Yeah, and so I just went down. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5059.0s)]
*  And I woke up at [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5061.0s)]
*  Baylor Heart Center, which thank [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5063.0s)]
*  God is only a few minutes away from DFW. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5065.0s)]
*  But ever since then, I've been [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5069.0s)]
*  on, you know, whatever. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5071.0s)]
*  Blood pressure medicine, blood thinners, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5073.0s)]
*  you know, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5075.0s)]
*  if I'm out, if we're out doing something [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5077.0s)]
*  outdoors and everything, and I cut myself, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5079.0s)]
*  pretty much it. Just put a bullet in me [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5081.0s)]
*  because I'm bleeding. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5083.0s)]
*  And so, but that's what the [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5085.0s)]
*  blood thinners do for you. What is [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5087.0s)]
*  the condition? What is? [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5089.0s)]
*  You know what? It's [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5091.0s)]
*  it's heart disease. It's [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5095.0s)]
*  I forget. They have a word for it. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5097.0s)]
*  It sounds very depressing when they say it. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5099.0s)]
*  Congenital heart disease or something like that. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5101.0s)]
*  But, you know, so it's a genetic [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5103.0s)]
*  thing. Nothing I can do about it, really. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5105.0s)]
*  Right. So, you know, I could [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5107.0s)]
*  modify my diet, obviously, and [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5109.0s)]
*  kind of adjust it the way that I work out. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5111.0s)]
*  But none of that's going to make much [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5113.0s)]
*  difference. It's in your, if it's in your family, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5115.0s)]
*  it's in your family, in a sense, right? [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5117.0s)]
*  And it's the high rate of passing it on. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5119.0s)]
*  So, you know, all my [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5121.0s)]
*  my parents went from that. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5123.0s)]
*  My brothers all have various issues [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5125.0s)]
*  and are carrying around hardware. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5127.0s)]
*  I've got some stents, you know. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5129.0s)]
*  So, it's nothing [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5131.0s)]
*  you know, I don't sit around [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5133.0s)]
*  I'm not deep enough to sit around and worry [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5135.0s)]
*  about it, necessarily, except for things like [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5137.0s)]
*  this where I think, well, can I do that still? [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5139.0s)]
*  But I'm not, you know, then again, I'm also [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5141.0s)]
*  like I said, I'm not organized enough to say, well, I should talk to my [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5143.0s)]
*  cardiologist. I think, ah, just do it, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5145.0s)]
*  or I just, yeah, I won't, you know. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5147.0s)]
*  But I need to be a little more curious. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5149.0s)]
*  If you're not a, you know, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5151.0s)]
*  I hear this all the time, if you're not an advocate [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5153.0s)]
*  for yourself in healthcare, you're fucked. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5155.0s)]
*  Yeah. Or if you don't have somebody to advocate [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5157.0s)]
*  for you. Right. Because the healthcare system [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5159.0s)]
*  in the US is so [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5161.0s)]
*  complex and [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5163.0s)]
*  not geared towards preventing, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5165.0s)]
*  it's geared towards treating [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5167.0s)]
*  sickness, right? It's geared towards giving you medication. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5169.0s)]
*  Yes, it's geared towards giving you medication. So if you're not [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5171.0s)]
*  curious enough and if you're not [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5173.0s)]
*  aggressive enough and proactive enough and taking [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5175.0s)]
*  care of yourself or having someone who's doing that for you, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5177.0s)]
*  you know, it's [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5179.0s)]
*  a tough ride. But... [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5181.0s)]
*  Back to Neutropics. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5183.0s)]
*  What they're essentially, the building blocks [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5185.0s)]
*  for human neurotransmitters. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5187.0s)]
*  And what has been done [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5189.0s)]
*  through this, like this is how we created [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5191.0s)]
*  on it in the first place. Okay. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5193.0s)]
*  When we created on it, we were trying to fit, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5195.0s)]
*  I got really [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5197.0s)]
*  interested in Neutropics from [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5199.0s)]
*  a product called Neuro One. And I was [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5201.0s)]
*  on this radio station in San Francisco. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5203.0s)]
*  Sarah and No Name. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5205.0s)]
*  And they [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5207.0s)]
*  had one of the, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5209.0s)]
*  No Name, I forget what his real name is, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5211.0s)]
*  but he had this stuff called [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5213.0s)]
*  Neuro One that Bill Romanowski [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5215.0s)]
*  created after his [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5217.0s)]
*  football career. Because he was having [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5219.0s)]
*  a bunch of problems from concussions [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5221.0s)]
*  and memory loss and all sorts of [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5223.0s)]
*  different things. So he started [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5225.0s)]
*  researching [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5227.0s)]
*  different nutrients that enhance [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5229.0s)]
*  memory. There's a bunch of different [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5231.0s)]
*  ones that [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5233.0s)]
*  are considered [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5235.0s)]
*  Neutropics. There's some stuff that I [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5237.0s)]
*  use called Neuro Gum. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5239.0s)]
*  And this is some stuff, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5241.0s)]
*  Neuro Mints. I have no affiliation [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5243.0s)]
*  with these people other than I buy their stuff. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5245.0s)]
*  I do have an affiliation with Onnit. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5247.0s)]
*  So we created this. And when we [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5249.0s)]
*  created it, it was a lot of people like, [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5251.0s)]
*  oh, this is snake oil. So [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5253.0s)]
*  we ran two double-blind placebo-controlled [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5255.0s)]
*  studies at the Boston Center for Memory. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5257.0s)]
*  And it showed increase in verbal memory. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5259.0s)]
*  It showed increase in reaction time. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5261.0s)]
*  Peak alpha flow state. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5263.0s)]
*  It works. And with Onnit, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5265.0s)]
*  we have a 100% money back guarantee too. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5267.0s)]
*  So if you try and it doesn't work, you get your money back. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5269.0s)]
*  What it does do is it [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5271.0s)]
*  enhances, I want to make sure they still have [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5273.0s)]
*  that, I'm saying that. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5275.0s)]
*  But the bottom [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5277.0s)]
*  line is, what it does is it enhances [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5279.0s)]
*  your memory. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5281.0s)]
*  Your mind works better [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5283.0s)]
*  when you take it. And [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5285.0s)]
*  again, it's not just AlphaBrain, which [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5287.0s)]
*  I do take. There's another product [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5289.0s)]
*  that I've taken called TrueBrain [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5291.0s)]
*  that works really well. I really like that [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5293.0s)]
*  Neuro One stuff. You just mix it with water. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5295.0s)]
*  The Neuro Gum is great [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5297.0s)]
*  because I'll chew a couple pieces [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5299.0s)]
*  of Neuro Gum before I do stand-up, before [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5301.0s)]
*  I do different things where I have to really think [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5303.0s)]
*  clearly. It works. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5305.0s)]
*  Okay, yeah. Well, I'm sold. I'll give it a try. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5307.0s)]
*  There's real [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5309.0s)]
*  nutrients that have been clinically [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5311.0s)]
*  shown to enhance memory. And what we have [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5313.0s)]
*  done is created a synergistic [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5315.0s)]
*  compounded [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5317.0s)]
*  blend of these and we sell [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5319.0s)]
*  it in that form. And this is the strongest [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5321.0s)]
*  form of it, was AlphaBrain, black label. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5323.0s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5325.0s)]
*  Yeah, because there are times when I just [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5327.0s)]
*  like... [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5329.0s)]
*  It'll help you. Yeah, 30 [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5331.0s)]
*  seconds and I'm like, what was I talking about? [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5333.0s)]
*  It'll help you. I guarantee it'll help you. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5335.0s)]
*  There's a ton of my [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5337.0s)]
*  friends who swear by it. I've given it to them [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5339.0s)]
*  and they're like, holy shit, this stuff works. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5341.0s)]
*  You know, my friend Anthony, who's the director [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5343.0s)]
*  of the UFC, he takes it every [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5345.0s)]
*  time. You know, when you're producing the UFC [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5347.0s)]
*  there's all these fucking moving parts. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5349.0s)]
*  The camera, get this guy over here, move that. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5351.0s)]
*  You have to be on point. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5353.0s)]
*  And he said it's made a tremendous [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5355.0s)]
*  difference for him. But it'll help your memory. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5357.0s)]
*  It does work. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5359.0s)]
*  And it's... what do you get? [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5361.0s)]
*  Online? Yeah, you can get it online. I'll send it [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5363.0s)]
*  to you. Just give me an address. I'll have a bunch sent [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5365.0s)]
*  to you. Cool. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5367.0s)]
*  I was going to mention [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5369.0s)]
*  Ukraine, because we started talking about that [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5371.0s)]
*  and how quickly we turned off it. But... [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5373.0s)]
*  You see Zelensky's asking for credit [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5375.0s)]
*  now because we won't give him any more money? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5377.0s)]
*  Yeah. Give me credit and I'll pay you back. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5379.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's... [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5381.0s)]
*  A, that's not a good road to go down. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5383.0s)]
*  But look, they're [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5385.0s)]
*  in a bind. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5387.0s)]
*  I was going to mention that [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5389.0s)]
*  UK intelligence, [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5391.0s)]
*  they came out with a report [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5393.0s)]
*  looking at [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5395.0s)]
*  the total number of casualties [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5397.0s)]
*  on the Russian side so far. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5399.0s)]
*  And they are basing it on, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5401.0s)]
*  they've done a fairly exhaustive [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5403.0s)]
*  study, and they're basing it on [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5405.0s)]
*  they think it's about 300,000. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5407.0s)]
*  Right? 300,000 casualties. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5409.0s)]
*  Not all dead. I mean, I think there's 120,000 of those are dead. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5411.0s)]
*  But to put that in context, right, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5415.0s)]
*  it's not even two years yet for [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5417.0s)]
*  Russia in terms of this war. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5419.0s)]
*  And [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5421.0s)]
*  so 120,000 dead, they lost [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5423.0s)]
*  in Afghanistan, which [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5425.0s)]
*  for them was 10 years. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5427.0s)]
*  They lost about 15,000 [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5429.0s)]
*  or so. Again, according to [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5431.0s)]
*  estimates, right? I mean, it's... [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5433.0s)]
*  Because neither the Russians nor the Ukrainians are [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5435.0s)]
*  being transparent for [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5437.0s)]
*  reasons that you can imagine in terms of [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5439.0s)]
*  morale, but they're not being transparent about their numbers. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5441.0s)]
*  On the Ukraine side, it's [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5443.0s)]
*  again, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5445.0s)]
*  decent US estimates. It could be [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5447.0s)]
*  about 70,000 or so casualties. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5449.0s)]
*  So it's a lot more Russians than Ukrainians have done? [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5451.0s)]
*  A lot more. But they have a lot more [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5453.0s)]
*  personnel, right? [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5455.0s)]
*  I mean, you think about it, they're three to one, right? [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5457.0s)]
*  In terms of outnumbering the Ukrainians on the battlefield. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5459.0s)]
*  They've got a... That's pretty extraordinary though. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5461.0s)]
*  It is. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5463.0s)]
*  It speaks to [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5465.0s)]
*  poor command and control. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5467.0s)]
*  It speaks to poor [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5469.0s)]
*  battle management, right? [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5471.0s)]
*  There's a lot of reasons. It also speaks to just a complete [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5473.0s)]
*  lack of concern over the lives of [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5475.0s)]
*  a lot of the soldiers they've thrown out there. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5477.0s)]
*  Those numbers, by the way, they don't even involve [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5479.0s)]
*  the Wagner group or [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5481.0s)]
*  private contractor groups. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5483.0s)]
*  So who knows how many of those folks went. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5485.0s)]
*  But the [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5487.0s)]
*  problem is, is that, yeah, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5489.0s)]
*  you look at that and you go, that's awful. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5491.0s)]
*  But it shows [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5493.0s)]
*  Putin's mindset. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5495.0s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5497.0s)]
*  He's willing to keep throwing people into this [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5499.0s)]
*  grinder and say, yeah, fine. So it does [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5501.0s)]
*  look like, and the winter months [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5503.0s)]
*  are approaching, which slows everything [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5505.0s)]
*  down. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5507.0s)]
*  It does look like this thing is going to go on for a while. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5509.0s)]
*  And I mean, unless they can come up [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5511.0s)]
*  with some settlement. But right now, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5513.0s)]
*  the Russian military is pushing [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5515.0s)]
*  offensively, right? They're trying to actually [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5517.0s)]
*  regain and gain [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5519.0s)]
*  some ground before the winter [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5521.0s)]
*  months really set in. The counteroffensive [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5523.0s)]
*  that the Ukrainians put together has been [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5525.0s)]
*  somewhat disappointing, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5527.0s)]
*  to put it mildly. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5529.0s)]
*  And then during the winter, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5531.0s)]
*  what's going to happen? The Russians [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5533.0s)]
*  are going to, they're going to spend their time attacking [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5535.0s)]
*  Ukraine energy [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5537.0s)]
*  targets to try to freeze them out [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5539.0s)]
*  during the winter, which they tried [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5541.0s)]
*  last year and [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5543.0s)]
*  had some success with. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5545.0s)]
*  They're also going to dig in. They're going to harden [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5547.0s)]
*  their lines where they're at. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5549.0s)]
*  You got the [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5551.0s)]
*  Ukrainians, they're, you know, [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5553.0s)]
*  things slow down. They're probably going to end up [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5555.0s)]
*  focused most of the time on supply [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5557.0s)]
*  chain, right? If they can [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5559.0s)]
*  cut the supply chain, or [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5561.0s)]
*  the supply line, sorry, for the Russian [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5563.0s)]
*  military, that's a big win, right? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5565.0s)]
*  And that's why they've been so keen [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5567.0s)]
*  to get more advanced [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5569.0s)]
*  artillery systems in there, because [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5571.0s)]
*  they want to be able to hit those facilities. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5573.0s)]
*  They want to be able to hit the lines. They want to be able to hit [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5575.0s)]
*  command and control. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5577.0s)]
*  Because I think they realized, you know, they're getting into [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5579.0s)]
*  one of their generals actually said this, and then [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5581.0s)]
*  Zelensky had to come out and clean up and say [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5583.0s)]
*  no, we're not in a stalemate, but one of the generals [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5585.0s)]
*  said, we're kind of approaching [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5587.0s)]
*  a stalemate here. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5589.0s)]
*  But to your point, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5591.0s)]
*  yeah, all those people [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5593.0s)]
*  that are out there waving flags saying we stand with Ukraine, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5595.0s)]
*  nobody gives a fuck right now. It's over. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5597.0s)]
*  It's over. I mean, so, and [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5599.0s)]
*  you know, the Republicans are, [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5601.0s)]
*  I always thought the Republicans wanted to [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5603.0s)]
*  defeat communism and defeat, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5605.0s)]
*  you know, somebody like Putin, but [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5607.0s)]
*  you know, they're the ones breaking ranks right now [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5609.0s)]
*  saying, we don't want to spend, you know, their point is [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5611.0s)]
*  we want to see transparency, you know, we want to know where [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5613.0s)]
*  that money's going, and that's a good thing. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5615.0s)]
*  Some of them are just kind of reading political [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5617.0s)]
*  policy leaves and saying, you know, I think the general [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5619.0s)]
*  public's getting tired of this. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5621.0s)]
*  Some of them are legitimately saying we're spending way too much money [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5623.0s)]
*  on Ukraine, why aren't we spending it here? [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5625.0s)]
*  And what kind of accounting [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5627.0s)]
*  do we have on the money that goes over to Ukraine? [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5629.0s)]
*  Well, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5631.0s)]
*  and here's where it's [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5633.0s)]
*  complicated in the sense that [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5635.0s)]
*  we spend a lot of time [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5637.0s)]
*  berating Ukraine for being very [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5639.0s)]
*  corrupt, and it has been. It's been very [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5641.0s)]
*  corrupt. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5643.0s)]
*  And so that's part of [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5645.0s)]
*  the problem is we knew [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5647.0s)]
*  going into this that they had a real corruption [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5649.0s)]
*  issue, right? [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5651.0s)]
*  And then we give them [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5653.0s)]
*  80 plus billion dollars, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5655.0s)]
*  and we don't necessarily [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5657.0s)]
*  have the best accounting, right? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5659.0s)]
*  Going back to, we're giving 10 billion dollars [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5661.0s)]
*  to Iran, but by God, we're going to know exactly [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5663.0s)]
*  where every penny's spent. No, we're not. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5665.0s)]
*  Didn't they catch one guy in Ukraine that [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5667.0s)]
*  embezzled a billion dollars and they just [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5669.0s)]
*  fired him? That's it? They didn't arrest him? [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5671.0s)]
*  They didn't? They've got some, actually they've got [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5673.0s)]
*  some of their military personnel [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5675.0s)]
*  now who are responsible for procurement. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5677.0s)]
*  They've got them in jail [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5679.0s)]
*  and coming up on charges, [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5681.0s)]
*  and they'll probably be convicted. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5683.0s)]
*  Now, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5687.0s)]
*  to say they've stamped out the problem is ridiculous. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5689.0s)]
*  Zelensky knows that he's got to [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5691.0s)]
*  be seen as being very aggressive towards corruption [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5693.0s)]
*  because that's going to keep the money flowing, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5695.0s)]
*  and he desperately needs that. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5697.0s)]
*  If he doesn't have US assistance and US aid, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5699.0s)]
*  this thing goes from being a [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5701.0s)]
*  potential stalemate to it swings [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5703.0s)]
*  the other way in Russia's favor, [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5705.0s)]
*  and not in a [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5707.0s)]
*  really lengthy period of time. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5709.0s)]
*  So he knows, he's [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5711.0s)]
*  got to be seen as doing everything possible to [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5713.0s)]
*  stamp out corruption and also [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5715.0s)]
*  having the optic of stamping out corruption, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5717.0s)]
*  regardless of how successful he may be, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5719.0s)]
*  but [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5721.0s)]
*  it's a real problem for him. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5723.0s)]
*  Look, the EU is sticking closer [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5725.0s)]
*  to them. I mean, we're getting these [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5727.0s)]
*  cracks in [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5729.0s)]
*  the US, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5731.0s)]
*  the European Union is, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5733.0s)]
*  they're still all in because [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5735.0s)]
*  they're right there, and so [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5737.0s)]
*  they understand that you can't let [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5739.0s)]
*  Putin win this. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5741.0s)]
*  So they're tightening [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5743.0s)]
*  sanctions. Look, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5745.0s)]
*  the biggest problem we've got is [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5747.0s)]
*  we haven't gone after the energy [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5749.0s)]
*  sector for Russia, just like we really haven't for [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5751.0s)]
*  the Iranians. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5753.0s)]
*  The EU implemented what they [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5755.0s)]
*  call an oil price cap. So they said, [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5757.0s)]
*  okay, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5759.0s)]
*  we'll only allow [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5761.0s)]
*  Russian oil to be sold on the market [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5763.0s)]
*  at $60 a barrel. That's the cap. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5765.0s)]
*  Now the Russians figured it out pretty quickly [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5767.0s)]
*  because that's what they're good at, and how to [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5769.0s)]
*  bust that sanction, right? So they created their own [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5771.0s)]
*  tanker fleet, and they started [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5773.0s)]
*  getting around. And [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5775.0s)]
*  they've, initially when [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5777.0s)]
*  that oil cap [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5779.0s)]
*  was put in place by the EU, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5781.0s)]
*  their revenues really dipped. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5783.0s)]
*  And when oil revenues dip in [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5785.0s)]
*  Russia, Putin can't fuck around, right? He can't [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5787.0s)]
*  do what he's doing. He can't support it. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5789.0s)]
*  And [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5791.0s)]
*  we haven't been serious about [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5793.0s)]
*  maintaining that. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5795.0s)]
*  Because in part it's energy. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5797.0s)]
*  Europe needs some of that energy. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5799.0s)]
*  So they've got to keep it flowing. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5801.0s)]
*  But [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5803.0s)]
*  they figured out a way to beat those sanctions, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5805.0s)]
*  and so they've doubled the amount [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5807.0s)]
*  of money that they made in October compared to September. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5809.0s)]
*  So they're generating [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5811.0s)]
*  enough to keep the war effort going, is what [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5813.0s)]
*  I'm saying, in a not particularly eloquent way. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5815.0s)]
*  So, yeah. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5817.0s)]
*  And then there's the Nord Stream pipeline, right? [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5819.0s)]
*  So Seymour Hersh reported [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5821.0s)]
*  that the US [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5823.0s)]
*  destroyed the Nord Stream pipeline, but [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5825.0s)]
*  now it's being talked that [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5827.0s)]
*  Zelensky and the Ukrainians [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5829.0s)]
*  destroyed it. Yeah. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5831.0s)]
*  It looks like, what's his name? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5833.0s)]
*  Zhevinsky? [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5835.0s)]
*  I forget what his name is. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5837.0s)]
*  But it [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5839.0s)]
*  does look like, based on the latest [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5841.0s)]
*  reporting, that it was [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5843.0s)]
*  a special operations [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5845.0s)]
*  effort by Ukrainian [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5847.0s)]
*  military. And [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5849.0s)]
*  the reporting is [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5851.0s)]
*  that it was a small team operation, that [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5853.0s)]
*  Zelensky was kept in the dark. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5855.0s)]
*  In part because [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5857.0s)]
*  they wanted to give him [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5859.0s)]
*  plausible deniability. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5861.0s)]
*  It's not necessarily [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5863.0s)]
*  good luck if they don't [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5865.0s)]
*  go to the leader and say, this is what we're thinking [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5867.0s)]
*  about doing, do you authorize it? Zelensky probably would have [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5869.0s)]
*  said no, so there's an element of that. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5871.0s)]
*  They probably thought, well, we think it's a good idea, so we're going to do it. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5873.0s)]
*  Let's keep him in the dark, and then he can say he didn't know anything [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5875.0s)]
*  about it. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5877.0s)]
*  But it does look like it was a small team operation. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5879.0s)]
*  They sailed a boat, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5881.0s)]
*  maybe two boats out there, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5883.0s)]
*  dove down, blew up [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5885.0s)]
*  the pipeline. And then it's been, but it's been [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5887.0s)]
*  confusing ever since, right? [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5889.0s)]
*  How did Seymour Hersh get it wrong? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5891.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5893.0s)]
*  I don't know what his sources were. So I don't want to say [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5895.0s)]
*  anything. He's a very, you know, he's a [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5897.0s)]
*  focused and energetic, investigative [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5899.0s)]
*  guy. He's certainly got a lot of experience. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5901.0s)]
*  So I don't know what his sources were. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5903.0s)]
*  But [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5905.0s)]
*  there was, you know, [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5907.0s)]
*  Russia was [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5909.0s)]
*  being blamed. People were saying Russia did it, which [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5911.0s)]
*  was not out of the realm of possible. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5913.0s)]
*  People were saying it's the US. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5915.0s)]
*  People were saying it's Britain. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5917.0s)]
*  People were saying it's Ukraine. You know, everybody was blaming [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5919.0s)]
*  everybody else. And it's still not [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5921.0s)]
*  completely clear, but it does look like [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5923.0s)]
*  it was something [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5925.0s)]
*  that the Ukrainians did. And [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5927.0s)]
*  you know, at the end of the day, that [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5929.0s)]
*  would make sense, I think. But [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5931.0s)]
*  it still [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5933.0s)]
*  needs a little more clarity. But I think that's [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5935.0s)]
*  seems to be where it's going in terms of the reporting. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5937.0s)]
*  But [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5939.0s)]
*  it's, yeah, it's [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5941.0s)]
*  remarkable because [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5943.0s)]
*  February will be two years. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5945.0s)]
*  And [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5947.0s)]
*  we were in Afghanistan [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5949.0s)]
*  for what, 20 years? [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5951.0s)]
*  Before [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5953.0s)]
*  people just said, fuck it, we're done. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5955.0s)]
*  We can't do it anymore. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5957.0s)]
*  This has been two, not even two years. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5959.0s)]
*  And you've got some people in the states going, fuck it. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5961.0s)]
*  We're kind of done. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5963.0s)]
*  Do we really need to worry about this? [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5965.0s)]
*  And [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5967.0s)]
*  yeah, it'd be great to [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5969.0s)]
*  figure out a way to be more efficient with our spending [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5971.0s)]
*  of our money and more transparent with it. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5973.0s)]
*  But [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5975.0s)]
*  I don't think people should underestimate Putin's ability [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5977.0s)]
*  to keep putting [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5979.0s)]
*  people in the front line [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5981.0s)]
*  and just riding this out because his calculation, [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5983.0s)]
*  much like it was with [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5985.0s)]
*  Hamas, Hamas knew what was going to happen [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5987.0s)]
*  with their narrative. I think Putin [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5989.0s)]
*  looks at the West and says, you'll get tired of this. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5991.0s)]
*  I'll just outlast you [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5993.0s)]
*  because I don't care. And [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5995.0s)]
*  he's dedicated [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5997.0s)]
*  to [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=5999.0s)]
*  rebuilding in some fashion the old [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6001.0s)]
*  Soviet Union. Aren't they taking prisoners [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6003.0s)]
*  out and giving them [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6005.0s)]
*  like, there's [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6007.0s)]
*  what was the report? That they were [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6009.0s)]
*  taking people that had these long-term [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6011.0s)]
*  prison sentences and they were [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6013.0s)]
*  giving them the option to fight [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6015.0s)]
*  in the war. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6017.0s)]
*  They would release them. Yeah, that's exactly [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6019.0s)]
*  right. And that's where [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6021.0s)]
*  you've got a [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6023.0s)]
*  Progosian who [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6025.0s)]
*  ran the Wagner Group [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6027.0s)]
*  or was the owner essentially [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6029.0s)]
*  of the Wagner Group. And then he died in that completely [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6031.0s)]
*  mysterious plane accident. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6033.0s)]
*  After he tried to stage a coup. Yeah. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6035.0s)]
*  I don't know what happened. How odd. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6037.0s)]
*  I'm going to look into that. Because I'll bet there's [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6039.0s)]
*  a conspiracy there. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6041.0s)]
*  There's a conspiracy there, but I'll bet we could get to the bottom [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6043.0s)]
*  of it. It says it's unverified, but [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6045.0s)]
*  they are reporting it. Ukrainian [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6047.0s)]
*  POWs being sent to fight their [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6049.0s)]
*  own army. Russian news claims [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6051.0s)]
*  oh wow. So they're taking [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6053.0s)]
*  Ukrainian POWs. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6055.0s)]
*  Unverified footage from state media shows [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6057.0s)]
*  captured soldiers swearing allegiance to Russia [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6059.0s)]
*  as a part of the new battalion. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6061.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6063.0s)]
*  Well that makes sense. Well now it depends on where [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6065.0s)]
*  those folks were taking [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6067.0s)]
*  POW. And it depends. Because if they were [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6069.0s)]
*  in eastern Ukraine, remember, [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6071.0s)]
*  then [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6073.0s)]
*  the bomb ass region. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6075.0s)]
*  Yeah. The Russians have been there for [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6077.0s)]
*  going on 10 years. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6079.0s)]
*  And the Russian [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6081.0s)]
*  argument is always well these people are more Russian than [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6083.0s)]
*  they are Ukrainian. They actually should be with the motherland. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6085.0s)]
*  So you [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6087.0s)]
*  may be talking about folks who got picked up and were like [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6089.0s)]
*  fuck it. I just got conscripted into this. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6091.0s)]
*  Not me. I'm Russian. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6093.0s)]
*  I consider myself to be Russian. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6095.0s)]
*  So there may be [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6099.0s)]
*  something more to this. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6101.0s)]
*  But yeah, on the other side, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6103.0s)]
*  the Russians, the [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6105.0s)]
*  Wagner Group built itself up by [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6107.0s)]
*  pulling recruits out of prisons. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6109.0s)]
*  And throwing them in the front lines. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6111.0s)]
*  But I guess the point being is [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6115.0s)]
*  that Putin [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6117.0s)]
*  is doing what in a way the Russian [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6119.0s)]
*  military has always done. They've just [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6121.0s)]
*  outlasted. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6123.0s)]
*  You look at World War II. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6125.0s)]
*  What they put up with there. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6127.0s)]
*  The losses that they had. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6129.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6131.0s)]
*  And I think the German calculation was [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6133.0s)]
*  always well, we'll get to a certain number [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6135.0s)]
*  and they'll give in. And they never did. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6137.0s)]
*  Because they can put up with a lot of suffering. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6139.0s)]
*  So I think that's what [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6141.0s)]
*  Putin's counting on here. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6143.0s)]
*  And again, he looks at the West and goes, yeah, you guys [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6145.0s)]
*  aren't going to last this one out. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6147.0s)]
*  Again, if he's right, [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6149.0s)]
*  and USA dries up [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6151.0s)]
*  for Ukraine, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6153.0s)]
*  that's fine if that's what people want. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6155.0s)]
*  But they better understand what that means. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6157.0s)]
*  And it means Putin's going to win. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6159.0s)]
*  And so, you know, [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6161.0s)]
*  just understand what your actions could lead to. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6163.0s)]
*  When Trump comes along and says, [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6165.0s)]
*  I could wrap all this up in 24 hours, [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6167.0s)]
*  how is that even possible? [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6171.0s)]
*  What is he saying? [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6173.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good one. I know. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6175.0s)]
*  I'm the only guy. What does he say? [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6177.0s)]
*  I'm the only one who can solve this. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6179.0s)]
*  I'm the only one who can sort these things out. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6181.0s)]
*  Trump's being Trump. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6185.0s)]
*  But he's, you know, [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6187.0s)]
*  he doesn't believe that. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6189.0s)]
*  I think he's not an idiot. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6191.0s)]
*  He says these things and he knows [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6193.0s)]
*  he's saying it. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6195.0s)]
*  He's going to get a sound bite. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6197.0s)]
*  And for Trump, you know, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6199.0s)]
*  all media is good media. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6201.0s)]
*  But no, there's no way [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6203.0s)]
*  to solve this one easily. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6205.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6207.0s)]
*  We've got two fucking major conflicts going on [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6209.0s)]
*  in two different parts of the world [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6211.0s)]
*  that are enormously complex. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6213.0s)]
*  And you look and go, okay, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6215.0s)]
*  how are we wrapping this one up? [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6217.0s)]
*  How are we going to end this? [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6219.0s)]
*  It's a very, you know, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6221.0s)]
*  I'm not saying anything that's particularly clever, [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6223.0s)]
*  but it's an enormously [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6225.0s)]
*  difficult time right now. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6227.0s)]
*  And people talk about, well, World War III. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6229.0s)]
*  That was always the beef on Trump, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6231.0s)]
*  was he's going to lead us into World War III. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6233.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6235.0s)]
*  I don't know. Can he do any worse [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6237.0s)]
*  than where we're at right now? [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6239.0s)]
*  Again, I think, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6241.0s)]
*  you know, maybe so. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6243.0s)]
*  But it's just, [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6245.0s)]
*  I don't think we're [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6247.0s)]
*  at the World War III point. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6249.0s)]
*  We would be. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6251.0s)]
*  The potential for [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6253.0s)]
*  a bad thing to happen if Iran had the [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6255.0s)]
*  nuke, right, [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6257.0s)]
*  that increase [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6259.0s)]
*  is exponential. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6261.0s)]
*  Because then in that situation, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6263.0s)]
*  you know, you don't know. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6265.0s)]
*  And maybe it does happen. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6267.0s)]
*  Iran attacks Israel. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6269.0s)]
*  I don't think it's going to happen [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6271.0s)]
*  in part because I don't think Israel is going to allow that to happen. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6273.0s)]
*  Getting good intelligence [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6275.0s)]
*  on the state of the weapons program in Iran [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6277.0s)]
*  is a very heavy lift, but I think [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6279.0s)]
*  Israel, you know, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6281.0s)]
*  has certainly [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6283.0s)]
*  better intelligence than they had on [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6285.0s)]
*  the potential Hamas attack [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6287.0s)]
*  that was building. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6289.0s)]
*  So I think if they get that sense, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6291.0s)]
*  I think they will act, [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6293.0s)]
*  because they're probably thinking, well, same calculation. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6295.0s)]
*  We can't, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6297.0s)]
*  we're certainly not going to be able to [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6299.0s)]
*  find stability once they get that. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6301.0s)]
*  Because that's just going to loom [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6303.0s)]
*  over the region. And then the Saudis will say, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6305.0s)]
*  okay, we want one too. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6307.0s)]
*  Maybe more than one. You usually have more than one [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6309.0s)]
*  in your closet. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6311.0s)]
*  And then all hell breaks loose. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6313.0s)]
*  So, you know, people always worry [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6315.0s)]
*  about, well, why are we talking about the Iranians [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6317.0s)]
*  and getting the nuke? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6319.0s)]
*  Well, look at the fucking regime, right? [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6321.0s)]
*  And look at what they're willing to do, and look at [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6323.0s)]
*  the trouble that they instigate and the problems that they create, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6325.0s)]
*  the instability that they generate. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6327.0s)]
*  And you think, really? [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6329.0s)]
*  You think it's going to get better if they get what they want [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6331.0s)]
*  with a weapons program? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6333.0s)]
*  So I think the Israelis, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6335.0s)]
*  the IDF would [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6337.0s)]
*  make every effort to degrade [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6339.0s)]
*  that capability if they thought that the [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6341.0s)]
*  breakout was too soon. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6343.0s)]
*  And who knows, you know, maybe the U.S. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6345.0s)]
*  military, you know, depending on the administration, [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6347.0s)]
*  maybe they would step in and provide that support. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6349.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6351.0s)]
*  So the previous administration [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6353.0s)]
*  had harsher sanctions. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6355.0s)]
*  And what else [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6357.0s)]
*  did they do that was mitigating [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6359.0s)]
*  a lot of the problems we're seeing right now? [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6361.0s)]
*  Well, they did, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6363.0s)]
*  you remember they killed Soleimani, [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6365.0s)]
*  right, from the [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6367.0s)]
*  IRGC. That sends a message, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6369.0s)]
*  right? Soleimani had a lot of blood on his [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6371.0s)]
*  hands. You know, look, you have to remember, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6373.0s)]
*  the Iranian regime is also [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6375.0s)]
*  responsible for the death and [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6377.0s)]
*  injury of [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6379.0s)]
*  a lot of U.S. service personnel, [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6381.0s)]
*  right? Because they were [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6383.0s)]
*  actively involved [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6385.0s)]
*  in working to get IEDs [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6387.0s)]
*  into Iraq, and they were [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6389.0s)]
*  training and providing [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6391.0s)]
*  support. And [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6393.0s)]
*  so they [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6395.0s)]
*  were killing U.S. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6397.0s)]
*  service people, right? And [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6399.0s)]
*  you know, again, we keep [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6401.0s)]
*  trying to imagine that somehow we can disconnect [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6403.0s)]
*  Iran. Okay, we're not talking about the Iranian regime, [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6405.0s)]
*  we're talking about their proxies and everything. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6407.0s)]
*  But again, it all kind of flows [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6409.0s)]
*  back to them. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6411.0s)]
*  So, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6413.0s)]
*  I don't know, I think, [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6415.0s)]
*  I'm not suggesting a [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6417.0s)]
*  military conflict with them. You know, they'll get [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6419.0s)]
*  me wrong, but I do think there are things we can be doing [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6421.0s)]
*  that can [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6423.0s)]
*  perhaps [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6425.0s)]
*  minimize their [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6427.0s)]
*  desire to pursue this path, [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6429.0s)]
*  or at least make it more difficult for them to do. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6431.0s)]
*  You're not going to get rid of that desire. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6433.0s)]
*  But yeah, so killing Suleimani was [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6435.0s)]
*  a good example of [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6437.0s)]
*  what they understand, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6439.0s)]
*  right? They look at that and go, okay, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6441.0s)]
*  they fired a couple of missiles, and they [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6443.0s)]
*  gave us a heads up before they did it, right? [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6445.0s)]
*  Because they were like, fuck, you know, [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6447.0s)]
*  if they're willing to do this, now we have [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6449.0s)]
*  to respond because we have to show our [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6451.0s)]
*  proxies and we have to show our [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6453.0s)]
*  regional neighbors that [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6455.0s)]
*  we're serious, right? [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6457.0s)]
*  We're not going to get pushed around, but they give us a heads up [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6459.0s)]
*  and say, we're going to fire a couple of missiles, and [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6461.0s)]
*  you know, so [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6463.0s)]
*  that's [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6465.0s)]
*  deterrence, right? [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6467.0s)]
*  And that tamped them down. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6469.0s)]
*  Occasionally you get a hooty missile [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6471.0s)]
*  flying over from Yemen, but [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6473.0s)]
*  so [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6475.0s)]
*  I think that's, again, you have to [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6477.0s)]
*  do something that's [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6479.0s)]
*  deterrence. And blowing up [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6481.0s)]
*  a weapons depot in response to [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6483.0s)]
*  a couple dozen missile drone strikes, [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6485.0s)]
*  and then they keep doing that. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6487.0s)]
*  And then the last one I think was Sunday, [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6489.0s)]
*  this past Sunday, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6491.0s)]
*  we hit a [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6493.0s)]
*  training site [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6495.0s)]
*  and a safe house, I think, used by [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6497.0s)]
*  IRGC and also by [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6499.0s)]
*  some militants that they have in the area. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6501.0s)]
*  And then immediately after that, [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6503.0s)]
*  that was the third response immediately after that, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6505.0s)]
*  we get more missile and drone strikes. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6507.0s)]
*  So, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6509.0s)]
*  you know, again, [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6511.0s)]
*  repeating the same thing over and over [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6513.0s)]
*  again, expecting, what is that saying? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6515.0s)]
*  Expecting a different result. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6517.0s)]
*  It's a definition of insanity. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6519.0s)]
*  So the previous administration, you know, [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6523.0s)]
*  they had a lot of flaws and problems, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6525.0s)]
*  but I think [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6527.0s)]
*  in dealing with Iran, I think they were [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6529.0s)]
*  demonstrably tougher. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6531.0s)]
*  I think also in dealing with China, [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6533.0s)]
*  I think they were demonstrably tougher. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6535.0s)]
*  We'll see what happens out of this [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6537.0s)]
*  meeting today with Biden and Xi, [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6539.0s)]
*  not particularly optimistic. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6541.0s)]
*  What's your take on this whole Trump [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6543.0s)]
*  trial? Because [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6545.0s)]
*  one of the wildest aspects of it [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6547.0s)]
*  is that every time they go after [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6549.0s)]
*  him, he rises in the polls. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6551.0s)]
*  And, you know, he was [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6553.0s)]
*  at the UFC this weekend in Madison Square [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6555.0s)]
*  Garden, and he's showed up [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6557.0s)]
*  at the UFC before. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6559.0s)]
*  And the response [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6561.0s)]
*  back then was [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6563.0s)]
*  a lot of cheers, there were some [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6565.0s)]
*  boos, this was a couple years ago. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6567.0s)]
*  Now, when [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6569.0s)]
*  he walked out of Madison Square Garden, [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6571.0s)]
*  it was fucking [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6573.0s)]
*  bananas. Really? It was [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6575.0s)]
*  the whole place was [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6577.0s)]
*  cheering. He walks out [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6579.0s)]
*  to Kid Rock's American [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6581.0s)]
*  badass. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6583.0s)]
*  With Kid Rock [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6585.0s)]
*  and Tucker Carlson, walking [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6587.0s)]
*  in like the right wing Avengers. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6589.0s)]
*  And the place [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6591.0s)]
*  went nuts. He's on the screen, [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6593.0s)]
*  and I'm telling you, the 99% [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6595.0s)]
*  of the Bill Burr's wife, [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6597.0s)]
*  99% of the people. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6599.0s)]
*  That's a Bud Light moment [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6601.0s)]
*  right there. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6603.0s)]
*  I mean, can you hear it? [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6605.0s)]
*  Give me some volume. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6607.0s)]
*  Why isn't it? [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6609.0s)]
*  Let's see if we can get some volume, because I'm telling you, [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6613.0s)]
*  the fucking [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6615.0s)]
*  cheers of the crowd were [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6617.0s)]
*  nuts. I mean, it was [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6619.0s)]
*  overwhelmingly in [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6621.0s)]
*  support of him, and it lasted a [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6623.0s)]
*  long time. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6625.0s)]
*  I mean, it was a [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6627.0s)]
*  roll. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6629.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6643.0s)]
*  I mean, you had to hear what the crowd sounded like before he walked in, and then when he did. I mean, it was just overwhelming cheers. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6645.0s)]
*  For like, over a minute. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6667.0s)]
*  I mean, just imagine a [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6669.0s)]
*  minute of people screaming [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6671.0s)]
*  at the top of their lungs. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6673.0s)]
*  Yeah! [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6675.0s)]
*  Well, obviously, you look at the trial, and you have to assume. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6677.0s)]
*  You can kind of tell, but... [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6683.0s)]
*  Oh, this is the Ferrero fight. Okay. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6687.0s)]
*  And obviously, this is a cage-fighting crowd. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6695.0s)]
*  Right? This is not the [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6697.0s)]
*  like a fucking [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6699.0s)]
*  unbiased sample [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6701.0s)]
*  of the general public. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6703.0s)]
*  Yeah. The New York elite [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6705.0s)]
*  buying tickets to the cage-fight. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6707.0s)]
*  Certainly not the liberals. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6709.0s)]
*  But yeah, if you look at the trial, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6711.0s)]
*  look, the Democrats look at that, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6715.0s)]
*  and they [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6717.0s)]
*  think the same thing, which is, what the fuck? [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6719.0s)]
*  How do we beat that? [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6721.0s)]
*  And so, [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6723.0s)]
*  maybe you beat it by just [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6725.0s)]
*  you just keep throwing shit at the wall [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6727.0s)]
*  until something sticks. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6729.0s)]
*  Right? And... [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6731.0s)]
*  But to your point, every time they do that, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6733.0s)]
*  his poll numbers go up. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6735.0s)]
*  And Biden's doing his own thing over there, [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6737.0s)]
*  whereas poll numbers are going down because of [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6739.0s)]
*  his own actions and the current [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6741.0s)]
*  administration's behavior. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6743.0s)]
*  And not just that. People realize he's [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6745.0s)]
*  really rapidly deteriorating. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6747.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6749.0s)]
*  I mean, there was a video the other day that was showing, before the 2020 election, [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6751.0s)]
*  Biden was talking. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6753.0s)]
*  And it's a marked difference between [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6755.0s)]
*  his ability to communicate then versus now. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6757.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it takes years off of anybody, right? [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6759.0s)]
*  You look at any of these presidents recently. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6761.0s)]
*  Except Trump. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6763.0s)]
*  Except... [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6765.0s)]
*  He did seem energized by it. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6767.0s)]
*  Like water off a duck's back, wang, wang. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6769.0s)]
*  He just fucking went right through it. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6771.0s)]
*  Despite all the crap, right? [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6773.0s)]
*  Despite three years of the Russian collusion, you know, [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6775.0s)]
*  witch hunt and story and all that that went on. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6777.0s)]
*  And, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6779.0s)]
*  yeah, it is fascinating. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6781.0s)]
*  There's people that still believe in the Russian collusion narrative. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6783.0s)]
*  Which is wild. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6785.0s)]
*  I've had conversations with people. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6787.0s)]
*  What about this whole Russia thing? [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6789.0s)]
*  What Russia thing? Tell me what happened. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6791.0s)]
*  Tell me what the reality of it was. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6793.0s)]
*  How much of it... Do you know how much it was bullshit? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6795.0s)]
*  How much of it was just Hillary Clinton [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6797.0s)]
*  propaganda? [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6799.0s)]
*  And then we have, [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6801.0s)]
*  on the other side of this, [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6803.0s)]
*  so you have that. You have these guys, Jamie Raskin, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6805.0s)]
*  Adam Schiff, all these guys that spend every day [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6807.0s)]
*  in front of the cameras talking about the evidence they've got. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6809.0s)]
*  And this is to save America. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6811.0s)]
*  And we're all angst over trying to destroy our democracy. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6813.0s)]
*  And it's all about compromise. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6815.0s)]
*  You know, being compromised and [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6817.0s)]
*  disinformation. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6819.0s)]
*  And then I go back to that story I mentioned earlier [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6821.0s)]
*  about Iran. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6823.0s)]
*  Right? And the Iran [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6825.0s)]
*  initiative. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6827.0s)]
*  Which, there's a lot [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6831.0s)]
*  there. Right? It's proven [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6833.0s)]
*  that there was an effort by the IRGC [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6835.0s)]
*  to influence [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6837.0s)]
*  government policy. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6839.0s)]
*  And through the use of [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6841.0s)]
*  government staffers who were [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6843.0s)]
*  sympathetic to the Iranian regime. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6845.0s)]
*  And also academics to [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6847.0s)]
*  push that narrative into school. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6849.0s)]
*  You would think, you'd like to think, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6851.0s)]
*  that Jamie Raskin and Adam Schiff [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6853.0s)]
*  and all the others who were so concerned about [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6855.0s)]
*  being compromised and all that, you would think [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6857.0s)]
*  that they would be out there spouting this thing, we have to get to the bottom of this. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6859.0s)]
*  But we still don't really know [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6861.0s)]
*  the story behind the US [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6863.0s)]
*  special envoy to Iran [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6865.0s)]
*  being suspended and having security [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6867.0s)]
*  clearance. They don't pull security [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6869.0s)]
*  clearances for no reason. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6871.0s)]
*  Nobody's asking about that on the Democratic side. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6873.0s)]
*  They're barely asking about it, to be fair, [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6875.0s)]
*  on the Republican side. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6877.0s)]
*  Because they're focused elsewhere. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6879.0s)]
*  But I think they're starting to. I think they're going to call in Mali and I think [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6881.0s)]
*  they're going to call in the Pentagon [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6883.0s)]
*  individual, Tabatabae, to come in [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6885.0s)]
*  and I think they're going to subpoena them. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6887.0s)]
*  And say, okay, what the fuck's going on? [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6889.0s)]
*  How could you not be concerned? [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6891.0s)]
*  With everything else that's happening [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6893.0s)]
*  with Iran, that you now [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6895.0s)]
*  know that they've been running this disinformation campaign [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6897.0s)]
*  through cooperative contacts [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6899.0s)]
*  and the White [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6901.0s)]
*  House has been putting people into places [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6903.0s)]
*  that were amenable to [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6905.0s)]
*  talking to Iranian [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6907.0s)]
*  regime members, telling them what sort of [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6909.0s)]
*  the agenda could be for a meeting, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6911.0s)]
*  getting talking points to talk through, [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6913.0s)]
*  all in the desire to have a normal [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6915.0s)]
*  relationship [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6917.0s)]
*  with a regime that [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6919.0s)]
*  sponsors organizations like Hamas. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6921.0s)]
*  Again, it goes back to [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6923.0s)]
*  other things that they do. It's a [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6925.0s)]
*  confusing thing. But I don't [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6927.0s)]
*  expect any curiosity coming from [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6929.0s)]
*  Schiff and the others on a subject [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6931.0s)]
*  like that. Which means [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6933.0s)]
*  maybe the Russia collusion story was all about politics. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6935.0s)]
*  I believe it probably was. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6937.0s)]
*  I think it might have been. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6939.0s)]
*  But what happens with Trump? No. Is there [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6941.0s)]
*  any weight to these allegations? [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6943.0s)]
*  One of the things that's so bananas is [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6945.0s)]
*  the overvaluing of Mar-a-Lago. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6947.0s)]
*  Because they tried to say it's worth 18 [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6949.0s)]
*  million dollars, which is so [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6951.0s)]
*  fucking crazy. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6953.0s)]
*  It's an enormous piece of land. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6955.0s)]
*  It's some of the richest real estate [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6957.0s)]
*  in all of America. And even [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6959.0s)]
*  if there wasn't a Mar-a-Lago [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6961.0s)]
*  there, like this insane, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6963.0s)]
*  beautiful resort, [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6965.0s)]
*  even if that wasn't there, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6967.0s)]
*  just the real estate's probably worth 50 million [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6969.0s)]
*  dollars. Just the land. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6971.0s)]
*  At least. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6973.0s)]
*  I think all the liberals [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6975.0s)]
*  that may be living in the area down there [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6977.0s)]
*  were probably like, oh god, this is going to completely [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6979.0s)]
*  devalue our property. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6981.0s)]
*  So they were probably pissed off as well. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6983.0s)]
*  But, no, [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6985.0s)]
*  nobody in their right mind actually believes [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6987.0s)]
*  that that's a legitimate assessment [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6989.0s)]
*  of that property. How can [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6991.0s)]
*  you get away with doing that [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6993.0s)]
*  and trying to enforce that [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6995.0s)]
*  in a court of law? [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6997.0s)]
*  I think they'll lose, [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=6999.0s)]
*  they'll probably [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7001.0s)]
*  win the day in terms of this [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7003.0s)]
*  trial. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7005.0s)]
*  They're going to [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7007.0s)]
*  pound this thing until, and then certainly it appears [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7009.0s)]
*  as if the judge is all in. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7011.0s)]
*  He doesn't seem like he's [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7013.0s)]
*  inclined to throw [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7015.0s)]
*  anything out. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7017.0s)]
*  But it's not going to win [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7019.0s)]
*  on appeal. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7021.0s)]
*  But what they're looking for, [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7023.0s)]
*  what they're hoping for is, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7025.0s)]
*  again, they see that, they see the video [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7027.0s)]
*  at the fights, and they think, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7029.0s)]
*  good god, we've got to keep him tied [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7031.0s)]
*  up, we've got to keep him wrapped up [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7033.0s)]
*  in these trials throughout the [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7035.0s)]
*  whole campaign period. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7037.0s)]
*  I think that's their goal, whether [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7039.0s)]
*  they can make anything stick. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7041.0s)]
*  I think it has the opposite effect. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7043.0s)]
*  The problem is it galvanizes his [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7045.0s)]
*  base, and it also makes cynical [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7047.0s)]
*  objective people that are on the [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7049.0s)]
*  outside realize what's going on. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7051.0s)]
*  This is banana republic shit. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7053.0s)]
*  Well, but I think it also, [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7055.0s)]
*  at the same time, they're hoping [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7057.0s)]
*  it reminds [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7059.0s)]
*  suburban moms and the people [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7061.0s)]
*  that he didn't get the second time around [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7063.0s)]
*  because they were tired from the [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7065.0s)]
*  chaos and all the tweeting and everything. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7067.0s)]
*  I think it reminds, [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7069.0s)]
*  they're hoping it reminds them of the [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7071.0s)]
*  chaos and all the tweeting and everything. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7073.0s)]
*  They're hoping to keep those people off [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7075.0s)]
*  the field when it comes time to vote. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7077.0s)]
*  But I think [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7079.0s)]
*  you're right. Of course, it [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7081.0s)]
*  definitely galvanizes his base. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7083.0s)]
*  I think it will, people who sit [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7085.0s)]
*  and think about this and ponder and [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7087.0s)]
*  say, objectively, maybe they don't have a [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7089.0s)]
*  dog in the hunt. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7091.0s)]
*  But then, how many of those [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7093.0s)]
*  people do you peel back over to [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7095.0s)]
*  the Republican side? Who knows? [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7097.0s)]
*  I think a lot. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7099.0s)]
*  I really do. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7101.0s)]
*  I think there's a lot of closet Republicans [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7103.0s)]
*  out there now. There are a lot of people [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7105.0s)]
*  that have switched over. I get tapped on the [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7107.0s)]
*  shoulder all the time. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7109.0s)]
*  In Los Angeles, [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7111.0s)]
*  in particular, if I'm there, people just [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7113.0s)]
*  kind of go, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7115.0s)]
*  like this, but they don't want to talk about it. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7117.0s)]
*  They don't want to say anything. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7119.0s)]
*  Good job. Keep it up. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7121.0s)]
*  So you're right. Maybe that [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7125.0s)]
*  changes. Maybe they come out and vote. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7127.0s)]
*  Because, like you said, at the end of the day, [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7129.0s)]
*  who's going to vote for [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7131.0s)]
*  Joe Biden again? [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7133.0s)]
*  But do you think they're going to run him? [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7135.0s)]
*  Because Vivek, [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7137.0s)]
*  during the Republican [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7139.0s)]
*  debates, he came out and said [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7141.0s)]
*  there's no way they're going [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7143.0s)]
*  to run him. And they need to just step up [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7145.0s)]
*  and tell us who they're going to run, whether it's Gavin [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7147.0s)]
*  Newsom or Michelle Obama. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7149.0s)]
*  Who is it? Who are you running? [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7151.0s)]
*  Because you know you're not running Biden. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7153.0s)]
*  I don't think they will. I think they'll [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7157.0s)]
*  be a hard stop [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7159.0s)]
*  at some point. We're a year away now. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7161.0s)]
*  I know. But their problem [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7163.0s)]
*  is they've got to clear the decks of Kamala Harris. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7165.0s)]
*  They know that [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7167.0s)]
*  if their concern [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7169.0s)]
*  is that Biden can't win, [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7171.0s)]
*  because he's just a good [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7173.0s)]
*  guy, they're going to run him. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7175.0s)]
*  And they're going to say, look, everybody gets older. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7177.0s)]
*  So, not just older, but the corruption that's been exposed. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7179.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's the whole package. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7181.0s)]
*  But if you just look at the age and say, [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7183.0s)]
*  okay, look, if they look at that and go, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7185.0s)]
*  okay, we can't run him. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7187.0s)]
*  Because I don't think they'll factor [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7189.0s)]
*  the Biden family [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7191.0s)]
*  activities into that calculation. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7193.0s)]
*  They'll just go, okay, we can't win because people view [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7195.0s)]
*  him as too old. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7197.0s)]
*  They're certainly not going to [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7199.0s)]
*  then pivot and say, okay, [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7201.0s)]
*  up goes Kamala Harris. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7203.0s)]
*  She's top of the ticket. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7205.0s)]
*  So they've got to figure out a way to delicately [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7207.0s)]
*  or elegantly clear the decks. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7209.0s)]
*  And then I think, [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7211.0s)]
*  I mean, God, because he's so [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7213.0s)]
*  desperate for it, but also because who [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7215.0s)]
*  else is running right now is Gavin Newsom. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7217.0s)]
*  And [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7219.0s)]
*  the DNC, the White House, would have approved [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7221.0s)]
*  his meeting. He met with Xi [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7223.0s)]
*  during his trip [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7225.0s)]
*  to China. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7227.0s)]
*  That sort of thing has to be [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7229.0s)]
*  cleared. He's not going to do that [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7231.0s)]
*  and then surprise the White House, oh, by the way, I was there [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7233.0s)]
*  and I got a chance to stop by and have coffee with Xi. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7235.0s)]
*  So that, there's [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7237.0s)]
*  a planning that goes into [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7239.0s)]
*  that. And so [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7241.0s)]
*  that tells me that's an indication [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7243.0s)]
*  that, yeah, they're looking to set the table. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7245.0s)]
*  Get them some international experience [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7247.0s)]
*  and exposure, right? That's always important. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7249.0s)]
*  Are you presidential? What, do you have foreign policy [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7251.0s)]
*  experience? Well, I sat toe to toe with Xi [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7253.0s)]
*  and [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7255.0s)]
*  bullshit, but it's Gavin Newsom. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7257.0s)]
*  He's fucked up California. Hey, you know, [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7259.0s)]
*  fuck up America. Did you see what he said [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7261.0s)]
*  about this whole cleaning up [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7263.0s)]
*  San Francisco thing? That when [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7265.0s)]
*  visitors come over, you clean your house? [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7267.0s)]
*  Like, what do you just let everybody else shit [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7269.0s)]
*  in your house all over the carpet [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7271.0s)]
*  when visitors aren't coming over? [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7273.0s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? That's the [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7275.0s)]
*  dumbest excuse for it ever. And just the [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7277.0s)]
*  anger that people must have, [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7279.0s)]
*  particularly people that own stores there [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7281.0s)]
*  that had to close down. When you're going, [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7283.0s)]
*  you mean you could have cleaned this up the entire [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7285.0s)]
*  time that quickly? Commercial [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7287.0s)]
*  and you're only doing it because of dictators [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7289.0s)]
*  in town? Commercial estimates are that [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7291.0s)]
*  over 30 percent [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7293.0s)]
*  of [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7295.0s)]
*  space down there in downtown San Francisco [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7297.0s)]
*  is vacant now. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7299.0s)]
*  It's an unsustainable situation, [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7301.0s)]
*  but yeah, I saw him [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7303.0s)]
*  talk about that and I thought, you know, [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7305.0s)]
*  I agree with you. If you're, [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7307.0s)]
*  I know some folks that live in San Francisco, and [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7309.0s)]
*  they are legitimately pissed off, right? [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7311.0s)]
*  Because, and they're very progressive. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7313.0s)]
*  But they, eventually, [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7315.0s)]
*  I guess it's like, you know, I don't know, [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7317.0s)]
*  and it's probably not a good analogy, [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7319.0s)]
*  but if you're, a friend of mine who was an [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7321.0s)]
*  alcoholic, well recovered [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7323.0s)]
*  now, he's a terrific guy, [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7325.0s)]
*  but he said, [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7327.0s)]
*  you know, I didn't even think about [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7329.0s)]
*  recovery until I hit [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7331.0s)]
*  the absolute bottom, right? [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7333.0s)]
*  And he said, I didn't even know where the bottom was, [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7335.0s)]
*  and I found it, and it was fairly self-evident. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7337.0s)]
*  And I think maybe progressives [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7339.0s)]
*  are the same way in some of these cities, [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7341.0s)]
*  until it really hits the shits, [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7343.0s)]
*  then I think they, [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7345.0s)]
*  they're willing to let it go, right? [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7347.0s)]
*  And then, and then it gets to the point [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7349.0s)]
*  where they think, even for them, it's [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7351.0s)]
*  it's not good. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7353.0s)]
*  So. I was looking at an article [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7355.0s)]
*  from earlier this month on [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7357.0s)]
*  Newsweek that may [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7359.0s)]
*  explain why there's a difference [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7361.0s)]
*  in value for Mar-a-Lago. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7363.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's Newsweek. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7365.0s)]
*  I know, it just explains what happened. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7367.0s)]
*  So he changed it in 2002 from a private [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7369.0s)]
*  property to a club, and in order to do that, [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7371.0s)]
*  that's what changed the value. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7373.0s)]
*  So as a private property, as a house that someone [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7375.0s)]
*  would live in, it could be worth over a hundred million, [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7377.0s)]
*  but it's not. It's a club. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7379.0s)]
*  And in order to make it a club, they have to [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7381.0s)]
*  make a bunch of agreements. I found another article [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7383.0s)]
*  from 2017 that explains [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7385.0s)]
*  some of the agreements he agreed to make. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7387.0s)]
*  And that alone, [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7389.0s)]
*  like right when this happened from 1996, [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7391.0s)]
*  it changed the value of six million dollars [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7393.0s)]
*  just from signing this piece of paper. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7395.0s)]
*  Yeah, but still. It's still the property. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7397.0s)]
*  It's still the property. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7399.0s)]
*  And you know you're always going to get [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7401.0s)]
*  nuts. You're going to get somebody [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7403.0s)]
*  somebody to roll in there and say, [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7405.0s)]
*  I don't want Mar-a-Lago, I'm going to [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7407.0s)]
*  raise that fucker, but I want that land. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7409.0s)]
*  And I'll pay you, like you said, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7411.0s)]
*  fifty million. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7413.0s)]
*  Signing it made it a historical property. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7415.0s)]
*  He bought it in 1998. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7417.0s)]
*  He agreed to keep it [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7419.0s)]
*  in the status it was, [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7421.0s)]
*  including carvings, columns, doors, windows, [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7423.0s)]
*  light fixtures, doors, floors, ceilings, [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7425.0s)]
*  and 25 different rooms. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7427.0s)]
*  That's interesting. I imagine that probably [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7429.0s)]
*  would devalue it because you can't do anything [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7431.0s)]
*  with it because it's an historical property. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7433.0s)]
*  However, still, [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7435.0s)]
*  just the property itself, [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7437.0s)]
*  if I could buy it for eighteen million, I'd buy it. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7439.0s)]
*  If I found out it was for sale? [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7441.0s)]
*  You know what? I'll chip in with you. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7443.0s)]
*  And I'll live in the carriage house. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7445.0s)]
*  Are you crazy? I'll start it as a podcast studio. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7447.0s)]
*  You know, we could do the [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7449.0s)]
*  President's Daily Brief from there. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7451.0s)]
*  Have a bunch of podcasts out of Mar-a-Lago. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7453.0s)]
*  It's about sixty-nine million dollars [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7455.0s)]
*  between 2017 and 2019. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7457.0s)]
*  Okay, so in two years, [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7459.0s)]
*  it made sixty-nine million dollars, and they're saying [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7461.0s)]
*  it's worth eighteen. That seems [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7463.0s)]
*  low. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7465.0s)]
*  It's not what [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7467.0s)]
*  Trump's folks are saying it's worth, [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7469.0s)]
*  but it's definitely not what [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7471.0s)]
*  the court or the prosecutors [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7473.0s)]
*  are saying it's worth. What are Trump's saying it's worth over a billion, right? [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7475.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7477.0s)]
*  I mean, hey, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7479.0s)]
*  a billion dollars here or there, Hamas [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7481.0s)]
*  political leadership could buy it. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7483.0s)]
*  They got the cash. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7485.0s)]
*  Or China. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7487.0s)]
*  Right, if China buys Mar-a-Lago, [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7489.0s)]
*  if Biden wins again and China buys [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7491.0s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago because Trump goes to [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7493.0s)]
*  jail, it has to go for sale. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7495.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7497.0s)]
*  Is there a chance he can go to jail? [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7499.0s)]
*  God, never say never with [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7505.0s)]
*  this situation, but I don't know. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7507.0s)]
*  That's way above my pay grade. I just [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7509.0s)]
*  think, I don't think they even care whether [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7511.0s)]
*  he goes to jail. They want the [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7513.0s)]
*  noise to extend as far [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7515.0s)]
*  into the campaign season [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7517.0s)]
*  as possible. That's my take on it. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7519.0s)]
*  There's also, he has [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7521.0s)]
*  said that he has unequivocal [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7523.0s)]
*  proof of election fraud. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7525.0s)]
*  But where [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7527.0s)]
*  is it? I think if he was [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7529.0s)]
*  again, what do I know? [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7531.0s)]
*  But if I was a political strategist, [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7533.0s)]
*  I'd probably tell him, back off of that, [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7535.0s)]
*  focus on the shit that's happening [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7537.0s)]
*  around the world and the economy. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7539.0s)]
*  And [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7541.0s)]
*  how does he [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7543.0s)]
*  get back those people who didn't vote for him? [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7545.0s)]
*  He gets them back by seeming [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7547.0s)]
*  normal. So back [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7549.0s)]
*  off all the other shit and just start [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7551.0s)]
*  because [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7553.0s)]
*  the Biden administration is giving the Republicans [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7555.0s)]
*  all sorts of things to talk about, [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7557.0s)]
*  to campaign on. And [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7559.0s)]
*  the one thing they know they can [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7561.0s)]
*  I think, this is them thinking it, [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7563.0s)]
*  I'm not saying they can win, but [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7565.0s)]
*  the one thing they think they can do is beat Trump. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7567.0s)]
*  Because he just [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7569.0s)]
*  does it to himself. And they can keep pointing [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7571.0s)]
*  to all these problems and [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7573.0s)]
*  they know it energizes the base, just [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7575.0s)]
*  like Trump's base is energized. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7577.0s)]
*  But I think if Trump just swept [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7579.0s)]
*  all that to the side, he's not going to, [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7581.0s)]
*  he's not going to change his stripes, but if he could do that [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7583.0s)]
*  and just talk about all the shit that's happening [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7585.0s)]
*  and how you improve the border [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7587.0s)]
*  and how you improve the economy and do the things that [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7589.0s)]
*  people actually care about, [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7591.0s)]
*  yeah, [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7593.0s)]
*  maybe that's a pathway to get those people back [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7595.0s)]
*  and then the numbers work. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7597.0s)]
*  But then again, if you look at the numbers, [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7599.0s)]
*  it looks like he's on the poll [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7601.0s)]
*  results for [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7603.0s)]
*  the potential match of a Trump [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7605.0s)]
*  and Biden. It looks like he's flipped [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7607.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania, right? [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7609.0s)]
*  And I forget, three other [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7611.0s)]
*  states that didn't vote for him the last [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7613.0s)]
*  time. But now poll numbers are showing [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7615.0s)]
*  that they would turn around and vote for Trump [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7617.0s)]
*  this next go around. So maybe they've got [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7619.0s)]
*  the pathway they need. I don't know. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7621.0s)]
*  Do you think there's any weight at all into his claims [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7623.0s)]
*  of election fraud? [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7625.0s)]
*  Do I think there's some election fraud? Sure. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7627.0s)]
*  And I think we'll get more of it [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7629.0s)]
*  the further away we get from [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7631.0s)]
*  in-person voting. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7633.0s)]
*  Show up at a fucking voting poll [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7635.0s)]
*  or a poll center, show your ID [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7637.0s)]
*  whether it's your fucking [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7639.0s)]
*  driver's license or your immigration card [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7641.0s)]
*  or whatever you got, right? That's not tough. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7643.0s)]
*  Everybody can get a fucking Costco membership [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7645.0s)]
*  and just [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7647.0s)]
*  vote. We used to be able to count all the votes, [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7649.0s)]
*  right? In the course of the evening, you go, okay, [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7651.0s)]
*  they won. But the problem during the [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7653.0s)]
*  pandemic was the mail-in votes. The mail-in votes. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7655.0s)]
*  They got everybody scared. You don't want to go there. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7657.0s)]
*  And the campaigns, or the [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7659.0s)]
*  Democrats want to keep that. They're saying, well, [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7661.0s)]
*  it's really good because it promotes it. And yes, [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7663.0s)]
*  you want people, you want to make it as [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7665.0s)]
*  easy as possible for everybody to get [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7667.0s)]
*  out and vote. But it's get out and vote. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7669.0s)]
*  It's not- In public. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7671.0s)]
*  It's not create some, you [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7673.0s)]
*  know, endless runway of [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7675.0s)]
*  opportunity for you to mail in some ballots [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7677.0s)]
*  or, you know, get out there and [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7679.0s)]
*  not bother to have your signature [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7681.0s)]
*  checked, whatever it is. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7683.0s)]
*  But [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7685.0s)]
*  I think we're going to stick with the [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7687.0s)]
*  protocols [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7689.0s)]
*  that we'll put in place because of the pandemic. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7691.0s)]
*  And do I think there's room for [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7693.0s)]
*  voter fraud there? Sure. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7695.0s)]
*  I'm not saying- It's not the [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7697.0s)]
*  same thing as saying, you know, [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7699.0s)]
*  was the election stolen. It's just saying [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7701.0s)]
*  you've created a system [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7703.0s)]
*  that allows [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7705.0s)]
*  it to be easier to [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7707.0s)]
*  commit fraud if you want to. And do you think [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7709.0s)]
*  that's the intention of the system? [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7711.0s)]
*  It could [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7713.0s)]
*  be. It could be. It could be. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7715.0s)]
*  Never say never. And I think that [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7717.0s)]
*  there are a lot of people that legitimately [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7719.0s)]
*  say, look, you have to make it as [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7721.0s)]
*  easy as possible for people to vote, to participate. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7723.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. So open up [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7725.0s)]
*  more voting centers, right? [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7727.0s)]
*  Use more of the schools. And then there's the most cynical [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7729.0s)]
*  take is that the reason why they're letting [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7731.0s)]
*  all these people in through the border. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7733.0s)]
*  And the reason why they're pushing for no voter [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7735.0s)]
*  IDs. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7737.0s)]
*  Is because they want these people to vote. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7739.0s)]
*  Because they let them in. And they know [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7741.0s)]
*  the people that let them in and they'll [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7743.0s)]
*  be loyal to those people. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7745.0s)]
*  Yeah, although the people that are [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7747.0s)]
*  busing up to New York, they're pissed off now [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7749.0s)]
*  at the administration because [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7751.0s)]
*  their hotels aren't nice enough. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7753.0s)]
*  So who knows? Maybe they'll switch [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7755.0s)]
*  their- flip their vote. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7757.0s)]
*  I'm more concerned when it comes to the folks [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7759.0s)]
*  coming across the border. I'm more concerned that it's [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7761.0s)]
*  a bunch of folks coming across the border and we don't know who they are. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7763.0s)]
*  Right. And that is a real concern. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7765.0s)]
*  And it's a real concern. And particularly [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7767.0s)]
*  in an environment like today, where [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7769.0s)]
*  you've got a lot of [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7771.0s)]
*  chaos in the Middle East and [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7773.0s)]
*  that raises the stakes, that [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7775.0s)]
*  creates more of an alert level for [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7777.0s)]
*  law enforcement and the intel community. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7779.0s)]
*  It's not tough to have a [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7781.0s)]
*  controlled border and a fair [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7783.0s)]
*  immigration system. You just have to [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7785.0s)]
*  have folks in Washington [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7787.0s)]
*  that aren't fucking dysfunctional, right? [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7789.0s)]
*  And are willing to work together and make it happen. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7791.0s)]
*  We could have a secure border and [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7793.0s)]
*  we could have a fair immigration system. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7795.0s)]
*  But [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7797.0s)]
*  for whatever reason, we [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7799.0s)]
*  seem incapable of doing that. Every other country [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7801.0s)]
*  out there protects their borders. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7803.0s)]
*  You know. Yeah. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7805.0s)]
*  That one [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7807.0s)]
*  continues to be a puzzle. But I will say [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7809.0s)]
*  if you've got a million and a half, which is a conservative [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7811.0s)]
*  estimate, a million and a half gotaways [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7813.0s)]
*  over the past couple of years. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7815.0s)]
*  Which is wild. Which is wild. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7817.0s)]
*  Then [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7819.0s)]
*  we have no idea. We've got thousands [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7821.0s)]
*  of known encounters of special [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7823.0s)]
*  interest aliens, right? Thousands of [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7825.0s)]
*  known encounters. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7827.0s)]
*  And special interest aliens simply [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7829.0s)]
*  means they're from a country that [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7831.0s)]
*  promotes, supports, [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7833.0s)]
*  or is [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7835.0s)]
*  otherwise [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7837.0s)]
*  troubled with terrorism. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7839.0s)]
*  And so [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7841.0s)]
*  you think [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7843.0s)]
*  about that. Think about, okay, those are the [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7845.0s)]
*  known encounters. Then you've got a million [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7847.0s)]
*  and a half or so gotaways. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7849.0s)]
*  And we don't know who they are because they're fucking [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7851.0s)]
*  gotaways, right? So how many of those [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7853.0s)]
*  are special interest aliens? How many of those [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7855.0s)]
*  are people who are intending [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7857.0s)]
*  to come here to cause trouble? We don't [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7859.0s)]
*  know. Could be a small number. Could be a big [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7861.0s)]
*  number. But because we're [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7863.0s)]
*  seeming capable of taking this [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7865.0s)]
*  seriously, [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7867.0s)]
*  you know, we've got a real [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7869.0s)]
*  security issue. It's a self-inflicted wound. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7871.0s)]
*  It makes the job of law enforcement [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7873.0s)]
*  and the intel community much more difficult. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7875.0s)]
*  Right? And [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7877.0s)]
*  anyway, but I, you know, [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7879.0s)]
*  again, that's barking up a tree [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7881.0s)]
*  there. They're looking to impeach [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7883.0s)]
*  Mayorkas. I don't think they will. But [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7885.0s)]
*  that wouldn't solve anything because he's just [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7887.0s)]
*  the messenger. He's just delivering the policy [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7889.0s)]
*  that the White House wants, right? Impeaching [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7891.0s)]
*  Mayorkas, okay, again, it makes people feel good. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7893.0s)]
*  Oh, look what I did. But it [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7895.0s)]
*  doesn't solve a problem. The open border policy [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7897.0s)]
*  seems so fucking insane. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7899.0s)]
*  It just doesn't, I don't understand how [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7901.0s)]
*  anyone [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7903.0s)]
*  would ever support [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7905.0s)]
*  that. It's just the [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7907.0s)]
*  possibility that someone could get [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7909.0s)]
*  through that's a terrorist is so high. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7911.0s)]
*  And when you [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7913.0s)]
*  fly in, there's all these checks. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7915.0s)]
*  If you fly in, [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7917.0s)]
*  like, what is it about an airplane [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7919.0s)]
*  that if you fly in on an [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7921.0s)]
*  airplane they have to check you, but if you just walk [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7923.0s)]
*  across, they're like, oh, you're good. Here's 1200 [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7925.0s)]
*  bucks and a cell phone. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7927.0s)]
*  Well, never [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7929.0s)]
*  underestimate the power [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7931.0s)]
*  of [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7933.0s)]
*  folks wanting to feel [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7935.0s)]
*  self-righteous. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7937.0s)]
*  And so the idea that they make, look and go, [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7939.0s)]
*  we welcome everyone. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7941.0s)]
*  It's like I can't swing a dead cat in my neighborhood [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7943.0s)]
*  without walking. That's an interesting saying. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7945.0s)]
*  So we should look up the origin of swinging a dead cat. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7947.0s)]
*  Yeah, why are you swinging dead cats? [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7949.0s)]
*  I know. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7951.0s)]
*  I thought he was going there. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7953.0s)]
*  God, I gotta take [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7957.0s)]
*  some of this because I just fucking [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7959.0s)]
*  blanked out again. What the hell? [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7961.0s)]
*  Well, it's a lot to juggle. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7963.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot to juggle. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7965.0s)]
*  The border, talking about it, [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7967.0s)]
*  people coming across. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7969.0s)]
*  The potential for terrorism. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7971.0s)]
*  The potential for terrorism. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7973.0s)]
*  I mean, if you've got a million and a half getaways, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7975.0s)]
*  just think of just small [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7977.0s)]
*  terrorist cells. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7979.0s)]
*  What kind of damage they could do if they're well-funded. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7981.0s)]
*  That's a good point. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7983.0s)]
*  You don't need, it's not an army. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7985.0s)]
*  Although it's an army that's coming across, [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7987.0s)]
*  but you don't need that. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7989.0s)]
*  You need a handful of people who are motivated, [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7991.0s)]
*  who have a support structure here in the US [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7993.0s)]
*  that we don't have on our radar screen, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7995.0s)]
*  and who are getting funding, [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7997.0s)]
*  whether it's from five different [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=7999.0s)]
*  cutout businesses that ultimately [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8001.0s)]
*  go back to the Iranian regime, [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8003.0s)]
*  or Hamas, or Hezbollah, whatever it is. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8005.0s)]
*  That's what you have to worry about. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8007.0s)]
*  Because that's how [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8009.0s)]
*  these things get kicked off. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8011.0s)]
*  And I think [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8013.0s)]
*  that's how these things get kicked off. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8015.0s)]
*  And one of the easiest things you can do, [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8017.0s)]
*  it's not easy, but one of the things they should be doing [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8019.0s)]
*  is securing the border. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8021.0s)]
*  And again, you can do that [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8023.0s)]
*  and have a fair immigration system. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8025.0s)]
*  I keep combining those two things, [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8027.0s)]
*  because one doesn't defeat the other. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8029.0s)]
*  So, [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8031.0s)]
*  and the White House [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8033.0s)]
*  should always want to do that because it's a national security issue. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8035.0s)]
*  And their primary objective, [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8037.0s)]
*  their number one job, [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8039.0s)]
*  is to keep the citizens of the country safe. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8041.0s)]
*  Again, it goes back to other things. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8043.0s)]
*  It's like, who in the White House sat around [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8045.0s)]
*  the other day and said, you know what we should do? [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8047.0s)]
*  You know what would look good? [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8049.0s)]
*  If we gave the Iranians $10 billion, [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8051.0s)]
*  I'll bet that would get those poll numbers up. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8053.0s)]
*  Who makes these decisions? [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8055.0s)]
*  So, I agree with you. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8057.0s)]
*  It makes no sense. Who are the people that [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8059.0s)]
*  think open borders are a good idea, [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8061.0s)]
*  other than people who think everybody's welcome? [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8063.0s)]
*  I know what I was going to say. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8065.0s)]
*  I couldn't swing a dead cat around the neighborhood [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8067.0s)]
*  without hitting one of those signs that says, [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8069.0s)]
*  you know, welcome here. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8071.0s)]
*  And then it lists all the people who are welcome there. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8073.0s)]
*  And it's in their front yard. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8075.0s)]
*  And I guarantee you, they wouldn't be welcome there. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8077.0s)]
*  Pull that bus up that's been dropping people off [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8079.0s)]
*  in Eric Adams City. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8081.0s)]
*  That's in your neighborhood? [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8083.0s)]
*  Yeah, Boise is a great town. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8085.0s)]
*  But it's also, you know, [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8087.0s)]
*  it's a Democratic city council. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8089.0s)]
*  It's a blue spot in a red state. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8091.0s)]
*  How does that happen? Is there a university there? [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8093.0s)]
*  There is a university there, [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8095.0s)]
*  but it's not, yeah, it's a good question. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8097.0s)]
*  I don't know how it happens. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8099.0s)]
*  But in part, it happens because [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8101.0s)]
*  liberals, progressives, [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8105.0s)]
*  I think are better [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8107.0s)]
*  at the concept of, you know, [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8109.0s)]
*  we want to control things, let's control it [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8111.0s)]
*  at the base, right? Let's control it at the bottom. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8113.0s)]
*  Let's get the city council. Let's get the PTA. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8115.0s)]
*  Let's do those things. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8117.0s)]
*  And, you know, the next thing you know, [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8119.0s)]
*  then conservative folks, Republicans, [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8121.0s)]
*  are like, what the fuck happened? [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8123.0s)]
*  But I can't, I can't, I can't, [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8125.0s)]
*  but, but, but I can't, you know, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8127.0s)]
*  they do their best, and Boise is a great town. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8129.0s)]
*  The state is fantastic, and I'm supposed to [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8131.0s)]
*  shut up about that. I'm not supposed to talk about that. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8133.0s)]
*  I, I, uh, [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8135.0s)]
*  what did I do? I mentioned, I mentioned this. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8137.0s)]
*  I go, there's a great bar in, [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8139.0s)]
*  it's a bar and restaurant in Boise [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8141.0s)]
*  called The Stagecoach. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8143.0s)]
*  And I think it's the greatest place, [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8145.0s)]
*  and it's been there forever, and people are fantastic. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8147.0s)]
*  Bartenders are great. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8149.0s)]
*  You always know what you're going to get. It's a very, very old school. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8151.0s)]
*  The waitresses used to wear these cowgirl [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8153.0s)]
*  outfits. They got rid of that. But, but, [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8155.0s)]
*  with the French skirts, you know, and everything, [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8157.0s)]
*  it was, it was just a great place. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8159.0s)]
*  Um, and, uh, [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8161.0s)]
*  I mentioned it at some point when I was, [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8163.0s)]
*  and people were like, you know, [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8165.0s)]
*  no, stop, stop talking about it. Stop talking [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8167.0s)]
*  about Boise, how great it is. Stop talking about it, because [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8169.0s)]
*  too many people, and we're getting a ton of people [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8171.0s)]
*  moving up there. I bet. Getting it, it's, [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8173.0s)]
*  it's, well, people are fleeing California. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8175.0s)]
*  Yes, exactly. And then they're [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8177.0s)]
*  bringing their fucking goofy-ass politics to Boise. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8179.0s)]
*  Yeah, because they don't, they don't [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8181.0s)]
*  draw a line, right? They say, wow, this place has really gone to shit. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8183.0s)]
*  I gotta move. That's nice. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8185.0s)]
*  That's a nice place, whether it's Boise or Montana [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8187.0s)]
*  or wherever. And, uh, and they [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8189.0s)]
*  don't draw a connection between that and how they voted [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8191.0s)]
*  in the previous location. Right. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8193.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, maybe one day [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8195.0s)]
*  it gets to be like that, but then we'll just move [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8197.0s)]
*  up to the mountains. So. Oh, Christ. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8199.0s)]
*  What? Oh, no, no! [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8201.0s)]
*  Everybody just keeps moving away [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8203.0s)]
*  and hiding, and the problem just keeps getting [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8205.0s)]
*  bigger. Yeah. No, you're right. There is [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8207.0s)]
*  that element. Um, you're right. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8209.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't, you keep moving away. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8211.0s)]
*  But, uh. Well, people are worried about that with Texas. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8213.0s)]
*  Because so many, you know, there's all this [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8215.0s)]
*  turn Texas blue, which, [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8217.0s)]
*  good luck with that. Yeah. You don't think [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8219.0s)]
*  that's going to happen? Nay. Yeah. Nay. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8221.0s)]
*  Especially when it's guys like Beto or [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8223.0s)]
*  Rourke. Oh, God. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8225.0s)]
*  That's your fucking choice, that dork. Well, and, [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8227.0s)]
*  and I will say, [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8229.0s)]
*  it is good in the sense that [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8231.0s)]
*  it doesn't seem like anybody's talking about Beto anymore, [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8233.0s)]
*  or Pete Booty, Booty Judge. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8235.0s)]
*  Um, some of these, [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8237.0s)]
*  some of these cats that were running previously. Yeah. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8239.0s)]
*  And you thought, who are these people? And why would [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8241.0s)]
*  you possibly think this? I mean, they were [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8243.0s)]
*  running fanaticals, fair articles about, [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8245.0s)]
*  about Beto O'Rourke, and, you know, he's, [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8247.0s)]
*  he's the man. Such a fucking [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8249.0s)]
*  tool. Right. 330 million [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8251.0s)]
*  people, and that's your guy? [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8253.0s)]
*  Um, so, yeah, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8255.0s)]
*  maybe, maybe they don't have success with Texas, [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8257.0s)]
*  but I do think it's, it is a problem that, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8259.0s)]
*  I mean, you've seen it here in Austin, right, over the [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8261.0s)]
*  years, and, uh, [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8263.0s)]
*  so I think we're going to get that same issue [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8265.0s)]
*  with Boise eventually, but, [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8267.0s)]
*  yeah, people just move and they think, ah, I'll just keep [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8269.0s)]
*  voting the way I voted, and then they're act shocked when, [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8271.0s)]
*  when things start to go to shit again, and then [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8273.0s)]
*  they move. It's like a swarm of locusts. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8275.0s)]
*  I just compared the progressives to a swarm of locusts. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8277.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's probably not good. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8279.0s)]
*  Well. I want to hear about that. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8281.0s)]
*  It's, uh, [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8283.0s)]
*  they're certainly infected with a mind virus. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8285.0s)]
*  It doesn't allow them to look at reality. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8287.0s)]
*  And, and just, they're so loyal to their party. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8291.0s)]
*  And when you're connected to [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8293.0s)]
*  an ideology, you subscribe to everything in that ideology. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8295.0s)]
*  And you think you're on the good side. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8297.0s)]
*  And there's, there's social pressure [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8299.0s)]
*  from the people that are around you and your neighborhood, [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8301.0s)]
*  and they all want to think that they're doing the right thing [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8303.0s)]
*  so that, you know, you're on their side, [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8305.0s)]
*  and we're all in this together, and Trump's Hitler. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8307.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8309.0s)]
*  No, I think that's, that's [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8311.0s)]
*  where it's, uh, and that's [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8313.0s)]
*  the problem we've got. How do you correct that? [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8315.0s)]
*  How do you write the ship? How do you get, uh, [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8317.0s)]
*  and we talked about that before, I don't think there's a, [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8319.0s)]
*  uh, I don't think there's a way to do it, [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8321.0s)]
*  because, you know, people have retreated to the trenches, right? [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8323.0s)]
*  And it's like, it's like the Ukraine-Russia conflict, right? [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8325.0s)]
*  I mean, they're, they're on both sides. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8327.0s)]
*  Nobody's moving, right? [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8329.0s)]
*  The lines, it's like World War I. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8331.0s)]
*  Nobody's, nobody's moving the line. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8333.0s)]
*  Um, and so here we got the same problem. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8335.0s)]
*  Everybody's sitting in their trenches on the right and the left. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8337.0s)]
*  And throwing fucking hand grenades at each other. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8339.0s)]
*  And you think, how do we, [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8341.0s)]
*  how do we get back to something that's normal? [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8343.0s)]
*  And you got this primary system [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8345.0s)]
*  that encourages, right, [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8347.0s)]
*  this divisiveness, the primary system [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8349.0s)]
*  that encourages the, the [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8351.0s)]
*  hardened edges to get out and vote during the primaries. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8353.0s)]
*  So then, what do you do? [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8355.0s)]
*  You end up with a, you know, a candidate who appeals to them. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8357.0s)]
*  And they're gonna try to soften it up a little bit [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8359.0s)]
*  for the general election. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8361.0s)]
*  Um, but, you know, [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8363.0s)]
*  it does, it's a, a selective process [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8365.0s)]
*  that I don't think does our country any good. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8367.0s)]
*  So, [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8369.0s)]
*  for what that's worth, wow. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8371.0s)]
*  I disappeared down that road, didn't I? [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8373.0s)]
*  Well, Mike, you, you never disappoint, but you always freak me out. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8375.0s)]
*  You know, [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8377.0s)]
*  I have to bring you in when I don't know what the fuck is going on. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8379.0s)]
*  Because you have a rare ability [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8381.0s)]
*  to sort of distribute this information [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8383.0s)]
*  and make it accessible to people. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8385.0s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, um, [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8387.0s)]
*  there, there's a, uh, [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8389.0s)]
*  no, fuck it, no. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8391.0s)]
*  I was about to say there's a positive side here. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8393.0s)]
*  There's a, you know, to look on the bright side. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8395.0s)]
*  I'm gonna have to work on that. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8397.0s)]
*  I'm not sure what that is right now. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8399.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the real concerning aspect of all this. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8401.0s)]
*  I don't know what the positive side is. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8403.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8405.0s)]
*  I don't know what the positive side is. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8407.0s)]
*  And I keep going to, I don't know how this ends well. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8409.0s)]
*  That's what scares the shit out of me. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8411.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8413.0s)]
*  With both American politics and global conflict, it's like, [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8415.0s)]
*  all of it seems like it's moving towards [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8417.0s)]
*  a very bad direction that keeps accelerating. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8419.0s)]
*  Well, I think, [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8421.0s)]
*  yeah, the problem is if we can, [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8423.0s)]
*  you know, [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8425.0s)]
*  there's gotta be a very short timeline [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8427.0s)]
*  on the IDF, on the Israelis, [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8429.0s)]
*  degrading Hamas. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8431.0s)]
*  Right? I mean, look, they have [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8433.0s)]
*  by some accounts, [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8435.0s)]
*  Hamas was made up of about 30,000 fighters. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8437.0s)]
*  30,000. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8439.0s)]
*  Numbers aren't clear [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8441.0s)]
*  in terms of how many militants have been killed. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8443.0s)]
*  The health ministry, [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8445.0s)]
*  newspapers always cite the Gaza Health Ministry. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8447.0s)]
*  It's run by Hamas. Right? [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8449.0s)]
*  So when the Gaza Health Ministry says [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8451.0s)]
*  there are 11,000, [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8453.0s)]
*  you know, fatalities, and 40% of them are children, [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8455.0s)]
*  that's coming from Hamas. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8457.0s)]
*  Right? So you have to understand that. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8459.0s)]
*  You have to step back and go, okay, [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8461.0s)]
*  there's a lot of civilian casualties, but what is the number? [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8463.0s)]
*  Right? I'm not gonna, again, [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8465.0s)]
*  I'm not taking the word of Hamas for anything. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8467.0s)]
*  But you also have to, [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8469.0s)]
*  you have to be, you know, [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8471.0s)]
*  empathetic, and you have to look and go, this can't keep going on, [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8473.0s)]
*  but they've got a right [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8475.0s)]
*  to exist and defend themselves. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8477.0s)]
*  And yes, they need a solution. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8479.0s)]
*  Is it gonna be a two-state solution? [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8481.0s)]
*  Like they talked about that all the way back in [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8483.0s)]
*  the late 30s. Right? That was when it was first [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8487.0s)]
*  come up. Two-state solution. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8489.0s)]
*  It was, you know, before World War II. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8491.0s)]
*  And they were saying, [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8493.0s)]
*  you know, this is what we need to do. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8495.0s)]
*  It came out of, previous to that. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8497.0s)]
*  I mean, look, Palestine, the history of Palestine [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8499.0s)]
*  is fascinating. Right? [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8501.0s)]
*  Controlled by, what, [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8503.0s)]
*  the Ottoman Empire for 400 years. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8505.0s)]
*  And then the Ottoman Empire lost it [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8507.0s)]
*  because they sided with the Nazis [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8509.0s)]
*  during World War II. And so [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8511.0s)]
*  that broke up the region, and they kind of [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8513.0s)]
*  split it all up. And [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8515.0s)]
*  Britain was given the mandate to control it. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8517.0s)]
*  And then they realized what a mess [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8519.0s)]
*  that was becoming. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8521.0s)]
*  World War I, they create a, [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8523.0s)]
*  what was it called, the Balfour Declaration. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8525.0s)]
*  Right? I mean, this thing is a, [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8527.0s)]
*  and then eventually they got to [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8529.0s)]
*  the late 30s, and the Appeal Commission [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8531.0s)]
*  decided, let's do a two-state solution. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8533.0s)]
*  The Arab world unanimously [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8535.0s)]
*  said no. Right? [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8537.0s)]
*  The [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8539.0s)]
*  Jewish population, [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8541.0s)]
*  some said, [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8543.0s)]
*  okay, we could consider that. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8545.0s)]
*  Another said no. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8547.0s)]
*  There's no good answer [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8549.0s)]
*  to this, and that's why [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8551.0s)]
*  I guess I was about to, I always try to end on [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8553.0s)]
*  something, my wife says I need to end on [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8555.0s)]
*  something positive. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8557.0s)]
*  I couldn't come up with one. Tell her to come up with one. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8559.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Let's give her a call [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8561.0s)]
*  right now. Let's get her on. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8563.0s)]
*  What do you got going? Give us the bright side of this. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8565.0s)]
*  God. Anyway, listen, [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8567.0s)]
*  I appreciate it, man. I always love the conversation. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8569.0s)]
*  I do as well. I appreciate you coming on. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8571.0s)]
*  And one more time, [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8573.0s)]
*  President's Daily Brief. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8575.0s)]
*  It's available [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8577.0s)]
*  number one on Spotify, I heard. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8579.0s)]
*  You know what, I'm glad you mentioned that. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8581.0s)]
*  It is number one on Spotify News. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8583.0s)]
*  That is actually pretty fucking awesome. Congratulations on that. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8585.0s)]
*  That's fantastic. It's available wherever you get your podcasts. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8587.0s)]
*  It's so great that you beat NPR. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8589.0s)]
*  I know, right? I just hope that continues, man. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8591.0s)]
*  Thanks, Joe. I appreciate you, man. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8593.0s)]
*  Appreciate you, too. Bye, everybody. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8595.0s)]
*  Bye. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwRVmSOEga8&t=8605.0s)]
