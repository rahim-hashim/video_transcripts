*  It's crazy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  Little reservoirs? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=66.68s)]
*  Yeah, the one I have is, I think it's called an Eevee, and you can just, it's like, to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=67.68s)]
*  go, you know, all this stuff, like, for women is like- [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=71.64s)]
*  Do they have like a trough under there that catches it? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=74.56s)]
*  They're like little, they're like, they're really cool. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=77.56s)]
*  And you can just be on the go so you're not, you know, chained to like the pump like you [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  used to be. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=84.84s)]
*  Can you hit a pause button? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=85.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  And then you unscrew it and like put it in like a freezer bag? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=89.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=90.92s)]
*  Yeah, they're advanced now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=91.92s)]
*  I mean, oh God, I've eaten so much humble pie, I think, since I became a mom. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=92.92s)]
*  Because you have that, like, everyone's like, you'll understand when you're a parent, you'll [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  understand when you have kids. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=102.44s)]
*  And you're like, ah, shut up. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  Because when you don't, you can't know until you know. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=105.64s)]
*  You can't know. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  You can't know. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  You can't know. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  That's why it's, it's just, it's, I think it's radicalized me too more. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  In many respects, like the stuff around kids in our culture right now, I'm, I'm like a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=117.6s)]
*  one single issue person now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=122.84s)]
*  I'm like, these kids can't know what they're doing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=124.92s)]
*  You can't influence them that way. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=127.6s)]
*  No. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=129.24s)]
*  And it's like, it's not informed consent because you can't know until you know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=130.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=133.6s)]
*  Especially about having a kid. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=134.6s)]
*  You can't know what it's like to breastfeed until you breastfeed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=135.6s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=139.96s)]
*  You can only guess. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=140.96s)]
*  You can guess. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=141.96s)]
*  And I'm sure someday they'll be able to simulate it and have like, but it's so, I mean, the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  whole pregnancy was, I had a lot of anxiety. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=148.28s)]
*  I think it was, I just was so worried about this little human. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=152.44s)]
*  And I think as a woman, you carry that mostly yourself until the baby comes out. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=158.36s)]
*  And then if you have a partner, you're sharing some of that like, oh, I hope they don't die [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=163.12s)]
*  with your partner. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=167.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=168.44s)]
*  And it was just like, I would get, I used to, I've been on this podcast and said I hate [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=169.72s)]
*  Instagram. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=174.76s)]
*  Like, I don't even know how many times I became like Instagram addict in pregnancy because [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=175.76s)]
*  at late at night, the like wholesome third trimester content, I was like, this is, this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=180.96s)]
*  is what I'm here for. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=187.12s)]
*  It's so relatable. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=188.48s)]

*  Third trimester content. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=191.48s)]
*  Like there's so much pregnancy content on Instagram because it's just an alter to all [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=192.48s)]
*  things basic. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  And it is. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=199.28s)]
*  And when you're pregnant, you're like, yes, that's exactly how I feel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=200.28s)]
*  I can't, I can't see my vagina. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=203.6s)]
*  The algorithm finds you because you look for it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=206.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=209.16s)]

*  whole system of how it works. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=256.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=258.24s)]

*  So because of our open society, they, they send, you know, basically employees of the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=266.46s)]
*  Chinese government to come over here to get educated. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=273.76s)]

*  Well, not to mention that it's breaking the brains of all of our youth and turning them [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=298.92s)]
*  into pudding. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=303.84000000000003s)]

*  I don't even know. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=352.44000000000005s)]
*  I don't even know what's on there. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=354.36s)]
*  I was having a conversation about this with a friend of mine the other day and he was [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  saying like that he has friends that have girlfriends and wives that are on OnlyFans. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=358.72s)]
*  And because they're making extraordinary amounts of money, like it's really hard to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=366.52000000000004s)]
*  not do it anymore. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=371.64s)]
*  If you're getting, you know, some, you know, we talked about this before, like the average [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=373.56s)]
*  person's not making much. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=377.26s)]
*  But some of these gals that develop these big Instagram pages where they have like a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=379.12s)]
*  million Instagram followers, they're making tens of thousands of dollars every month on [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=383.76s)]
*  OnlyFans. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=389.84s)]
*  And so then they get in a relationship and you know, it's a serious relationship, but [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=390.96s)]
*  you know, you're fingering yourself on this fucking platform for strangers. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=394.88s)]
*  It's like, where does that end? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=400.52s)]
*  And what, okay, if you have a child, do you back off them? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=401.76s)]
*  Well, honey, we need money, you know? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=404.6s)]
*  I mean, it's no big deal. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=406.4s)]
*  You know, my fans are cool. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=407.92s)]
*  They realize that I'm taken and I'm a mom and like, it's a, I am all for freedom, right? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=409.2s)]
*  I'm all for you being able to do whatever you want to do, but everything comes with [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=415.76s)]
*  a price. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=419.88s)]
*  Of course. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=420.88s)]
*  And that thing comes with a weird price because it's, you're selling intimacy. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=421.88s)]
*  The photo is a woman alone in a bedroom or a video is a woman alone in a bedroom with [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=426.88s)]
*  like ankle socks and fucking, you know, a jersey on with a little baby underwear that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=432.64s)]
*  she's pulling to the side. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=439.32s)]
*  Like what, what is that? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=440.56s)]
*  Like who's there? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=443.4s)]
*  Like who's taking this photo? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=444.4s)]
*  I mean, is this for, is this, are you pretending that this is for you? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=446.12s)]
*  Like this, it's a weird little relationship that you have for these people that pay to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=450.32s)]
*  subscribe. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  I would be a full of shit hypocrite if I didn't address the fact that I've, okay. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=455.72s)]
*  So I started posting nudes online for free and then people started demanding them and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=463.04s)]
*  I was just posting them because I thought it was funny mostly because it made comedians [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=469.36s)]
*  mad on Twitter that I was using nudity to get followers. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=472.44000000000005s)]
*  And I just thought it was hilarious because I'm like, I was like a trickster. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=475.8s)]
*  I'm like, whatever. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=479.68s)]
*  Who, who would get mad at that? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=480.68s)]
*  People were just getting mad that like not important people. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=482.44000000000005s)]
*  Because people were like, oh, this, this girl is like, it's unlike who cares. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=485.12s)]
*  But it was funny to me and it was amusing. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=489.76s)]
*  And then people started demanding them and then Patreon came around and then you can [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=492.72s)]
*  have different levels and Patreon. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=496.6s)]
*  And one of my levels was not like vagina pictures, but pictures of my boobs in my butt. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=498.76s)]
*  And I was like, who wants to pay for 40 year old titties? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=505.04s)]
*  No one. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=510.96s)]
*  Someone. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=511.96s)]
*  You can get them for free. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=512.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=513.96s)]
*  And they were all paid. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=514.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=515.96s)]
*  And I thought it was, it was in, like you said, it gave me insight into this relationship [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=516.96s)]
*  because I was, everybody's very respectful, first of all, and they were paying for my [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=521.0400000000001s)]
*  writing and all this other stuff. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=526.6s)]
*  And it got weird. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=528.08s)]
*  Definitely where I was like, what? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=529.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to get addicted to the money doing this because I'm doing it for fun. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=531.24s)]
*  Like it was something that I started doing. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=539.72s)]
*  I never wanted to feel like I had to do it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=541.2s)]
*  And I ended up just, I just shifted away from doing it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=544.6s)]
*  I just like naturally evolved out of it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=548.52s)]
*  But I was making pretty good money. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=551.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=553.9599999999999s)]
*  I still don't understand it, but it gave me a lot of insight. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=554.9599999999999s)]
*  And I just like, I would be, I know that if I did not address this, people would be like, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=558.76s)]
*  that girl used to have pictures of her butt on the internet. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=563.6s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you addressed it then. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=566.04s)]
*  It's just a strange little outlet. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=568.4399999999999s)]
*  Look, I'm all for people capitalizing and using, you know, finding different ways to [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  make money. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=575.72s)]
*  That's not the issue that I have. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=576.72s)]
*  I don't even have an issue with it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=578.0s)]
*  I'm all for you doing it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=579.72s)]
*  But I'm just saying like for a person that's in a relationship or a person that one day [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=581.24s)]
*  is going to be a mom or a person, you're like, that's the thing. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=585.12s)]
*  How am I going to explain this? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=587.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's out there. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=589.16s)]
*  Well, I think you explained it by being yourself. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=590.76s)]
*  Like you're a good person. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=593.16s)]
*  You'll be honest with your kid. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=595.28s)]
*  It's not the worst thing in the world. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=597.62s)]
*  It's not even a bad thing. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=598.8000000000001s)]
*  I did it only because mostly because people started demanding them and getting entitled. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=599.92s)]
*  And I was like, now you bastards are going to have to pay. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=604.36s)]
*  And it was never something like I'm going to do this if I don't want to. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=608.04s)]
*  And then naturally I grew up, I got into a relationship and like even my husband will [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=613.36s)]
*  get it online. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=619.56s)]
*  People will be like, you know, your wife boobs are online. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=620.56s)]
*  He's like, they are. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=622.88s)]
*  Of course he knows. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=626.0799999999999s)]
*  And he knew that this was and he never like pressured me not to, but I didn't want to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=627.08s)]
*  anymore because like I said to my friend once, I was like, why are people paying for this? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=631.9200000000001s)]
*  And he's like, there are a lot of lonely people in the world, Bridget. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=636.44s)]
*  There are. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=639.4000000000001s)]
*  There are also a lot of people that get obsessed with other people. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=640.4000000000001s)]
*  They read your writing. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=642.4000000000001s)]
*  They like the way you think. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=643.8000000000001s)]
*  They get kind of obsessed with your mind. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=644.8000000000001s)]
*  They pretend they're in a relationship with you. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=647.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=648.96s)]
*  So I had a lot of insight into it though. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=649.96s)]
*  And it really, I mean, we were laughing hysterically about this the other day because an email [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=654.0s)]
*  came through and this guy was like, can Bridget please take some nice high resolution pictures [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=659.52s)]
*  of her butt hole? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=667.6s)]
*  High resolution. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=670.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=671.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=672.08s)]
*  Apparently that's a big request on the OnlyFans. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=673.08s)]
*  Is it? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=674.96s)]
*  They want butt hole photos. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=675.96s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=676.96s)]
*  See I never. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=677.96s)]
*  Part of the reason that I started putting nudes online is, and I've written about this [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=678.96s)]
*  for Playboy and I think it's like one of the few articles that's still up on Playboy [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=683.0s)]
*  of my hundred that were there. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=687.48s)]
*  And it was why I get naked online or why I post nudes online. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=690.06s)]
*  And part of it was I was like real early sending nudies. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=693.98s)]
*  I would take a picture with a digital camera, upload it to my computer and then send them [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=699.52s)]
*  via email to guys. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=704.92s)]
*  I was probably like 23 when the technology became because I thought it was fun and flirty. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=707.48s)]
*  And then I realized like, oh shit, this is out there. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  And I didn't want anybody to have like the power over me that they could hold that over [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=718.24s)]
*  my head ever. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=723.5600000000001s)]
*  Even though I was a nobody, I don't know what I was thinking. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=724.5600000000001s)]
*  But I didn't want anyone to be able to hold it over me. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=727.8000000000001s)]
*  And so I just started, I mean since like 2006 when I started my website, I was posting greeting [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=730.72s)]
*  cards that I made with nude pictures of mine on there. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=739.02s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with being nude. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=742.48s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with posting pictures of nude. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=744.08s)]
*  You said Playboy took, did they take some of your articles down? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=747.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=751.2s)]
*  And I had, I mean I had written, you know, you posted one of my early pieces actually, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=752.2s)]
*  the women date assholes because you're a pussy. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=757.32s)]
*  Still one of my favorite things I've ever written. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=762.72s)]
*  And that's still up there. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=765.48s)]
*  The one about getting nude is up there. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=768.6400000000001s)]
*  But then most, I did like some of the work I did for them, I was very proud of. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=771.96s)]
*  And I turned into more of a journalist working for them. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=776.2800000000001s)]
*  My first editor, Joe Donatelli, I used to be like, I'm not a journalist, I'm an opinion [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=779.0600000000001s)]
*  writer. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=783.6400000000001s)]
*  All good opinion writers are journalists. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=784.76s)]
*  And I was, like I went to a Free the Nipple thing. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=787.6s)]
*  This was kind of when things started evolving. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=790.68s)]
*  And I was like all about Free the Nipple, so I thought. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=794.4399999999999s)]
*  And I went, I was supposed to go cover this rally. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=797.76s)]
*  And I get there and this very young girl is like barely legal, like maybe turned 18 the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=800.52s)]
*  day before the rally. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=807.3199999999999s)]
*  And she's kind of running this Free the Nipple thing. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=809.34s)]
*  With a lot of her young friends on the beach in Santa Monica. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=812.64s)]
*  And suddenly I went in being like, yeah, I'm going to be all for this. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=815.96s)]
*  And then there was this pervert on the beach and he was there with like a digital camera, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=819.88s)]
*  which was my first red flag. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=824.8s)]
*  And because this was, you know, it was just creepy. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=827.68s)]
*  And he was taking pictures of them and all of a sudden I was like, put your clothes on, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=830.68s)]
*  ladies. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=835.0s)]
*  There are perverts everywhere. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=836.0s)]
*  There's a pedophile over there. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=840.0s)]
*  And it changed my, suddenly I was like, I'm not sure how I feel about this. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=843.0s)]
*  Do you think it's just like girls that just want attention but they don't know what that means? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=847.0s)]
*  These girls didn't, this girl, at least the one who was in charge, was so, she was so [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=852.0s)]
*  interesting and just like, she was like a radical feminist. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=857.0s)]
*  Just a young radical feminist who was like, men can have their nipples out, why can't women? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=860.0s)]
*  And they can be free on the beach, why can't we? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=866.0s)]
*  And so she was just, I think, pushing for more equality in her mind. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=870.0s)]
*  And I understood that. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=877.0s)]
*  You know, I don't think it was for her, like, about getting, she didn't strike me as that kind of person, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=879.0s)]
*  at least when I met her. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=884.0s)]
*  And it was just, it was a very strange scene. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=886.0s)]
*  And I left it. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=892.0s)]
*  And I went back to my editor and I was like, I have no idea how I feel about this anymore. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=893.0s)]
*  And he's like, good, that means you're a journalist. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=897.0s)]
*  That's what journalists should do, go in with maybe some feeling of how they think and gather information [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=899.0s)]
*  that might change their mind. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=905.0s)]
*  That is really journalism. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=907.0s)]
*  And that is actually an important opinion piece because you went in with this one idea and then seeing the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=909.0s)]
*  reality of the situation made you alter your perceptions. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=915.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, even having now being breastfeeding and being a mom and being somebody who's just been, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=918.0s)]
*  like my body was a vanity project, I was like, oh, this has utility. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=927.0s)]
*  Utility. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=934.0s)]
*  Like these things, they have a purpose. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=936.0s)]
*  It is kind of wild that that's the reason why we're attracted to them. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=938.0s)]
*  That we're attracted to them because of the fact that they have utility. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=942.0s)]
*  Women that have more traditionally sexually attractive bodies are more likely to breed. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=946.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=955.0s)]
*  They're more, you know, what's the word I'm looking for? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=956.0s)]
*  Fuckable? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=960.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=962.0s)]
*  Viable? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=964.0s)]
*  Viable? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=965.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=966.0s)]
*  Whatever word we use. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=967.0s)]
*  It's going to be a problem. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=969.0s)]
*  But it might, you know, like the narrower hips or the narrow waist, the large hips, that's all so you could give babies better. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=970.0s)]
*  You give birth better. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=977.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=978.0s)]
*  It's weird how all that stuff works. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=979.0s)]
*  I don't have breeding hips. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=980.0s)]
*  My child came out as writer and thinker and hilarious. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=982.0s)]
*  Mary Harrington calls it. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=988.0s)]
*  She came out of the sun roof. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=990.0s)]
*  That's, imagine being a person without breeding hips that was born 100 years ago. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=994.0s)]
*  You would have died. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=999.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1000.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1001.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1002.0s)]
*  That's that's another thing. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1003.0s)]
*  Childbirth is still very dangerous. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1004.0s)]
*  I was not one of those like I'm going to have a pool and go have my baby in the moonlight all by myself with a doula. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1005.0s)]
*  And like that I admire women who do that because they are they have some ability to just block out fear or something. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1013.0s)]
*  It's just like I don't I don't know. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1024.0s)]
*  There are women who are just so good at the home births and the home birth is weird because if something goes sideways. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1026.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1031.0s)]
*  I mean it's terrifying me. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1032.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1034.0s)]
*  You want to be around people that have a lot of kids come out of vaginas on a weekly basis and they're really good at it. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1035.0s)]
*  And I know so many women who have had home births and they were completely fine and they had their their baby. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1042.0s)]
*  And but I just I was in I was I think I was really affected when I was in Dublin. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1048.0s)]
*  I was in this it was like a big grave cemetery and there were all these like it was like a dead kid area basically babies that died in birth and childbirth from. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1055.0s)]
*  And there were just thousands of them. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1066.0s)]
*  There's a whole portion of the cemetery devoted to this and a lot of the moms to died and a lot of the names were Bridget. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1069.0s)]
*  My friend was like is this making you uncomfortable. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1076.0s)]
*  I'm like no I'm just another dead Bridget. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1079.0s)]
*  It's like weirdly just like another soon to be dead Bridget. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1082.0s)]
*  It's that part of the world that name pretty popular. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1085.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1087.0s)]
*  But it was it really struck me how far we've come in terms of making childbirth safe. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1088.0s)]
*  And I think it's like a lot of things. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1094.0s)]
*  The reason you think you don't need a measles vaccine is because we don't have the measles anymore and kids aren't dying of the measles. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1097.0s)]
*  And the reason home births are probably rising in popularity is because people don't die in childbirth as often as they did. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1105.0s)]
*  Well it's the same reason why people like like reclaimed wood paneling on the walls. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1114.0s)]
*  They want to they want to like go back to the old days in their head. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1118.0s)]
*  Do you want to go back to the old days. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1122.0s)]
*  It looks good. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1124.0s)]
*  It does like but there's a thing about it. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1125.0s)]
*  It's like you're trying to pretend you live in a barn. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1127.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1131.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1132.0s)]
*  It's like I want organic everything and I want you know it's like there's this thing I want hand pressed butter. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1133.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1139.0s)]
*  I want hand churned this and it's we we have like this. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1140.0s)]
*  But I don't want to press it. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1144.0s)]
*  I don't want to have to like actually churn it. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1146.0s)]
*  It's like idealistic view of the past. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1149.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1152.0s)]
*  And of you know natural air quotes. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1153.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1156.0s)]
*  And there is something to be said for it. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1157.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1159.0s)]
*  But it was very time consuming. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1160.0s)]
*  People are getting like their their churned butter like postmated to them now. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1162.0s)]
*  Even like a natural birth in a bathtub. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1167.0s)]
*  I'm like listen let's be real. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1169.0s)]
*  When people first had babies they shit them out in a cave floor. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1171.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1174.0s)]
*  Like the technology of a bathtub. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1175.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1179.0s)]
*  Lend to safer births like you know you can take that one step further and go to the fucking hospital. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1180.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1185.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1186.0s)]
*  I went to the hospital. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1187.0s)]
*  Go to the hospital. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1188.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1189.0s)]
*  Kids. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1190.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1191.0s)]
*  Some people you're going to get a lot of pushback on that because there's a whole. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1192.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1196.0s)]
*  Home movement. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1197.0s)]
*  Home birth movement. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1198.0s)]
*  And it's. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1199.0s)]
*  But when you actually like I went down the rabbit hole of the numbers and when you look [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1200.0s)]
*  at the actual statistics I'm like did these people not look at statistics. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1204.0s)]
*  I think it's like 50 percent of them end up going to a hospital. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1208.0s)]
*  The ones because so it's so much can so much can go wrong. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1213.0s)]
*  You first you first feel the vagina tear pain and you're like is there a way you can stop [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1217.0s)]
*  this from happening. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1224.0s)]
*  The Ring of Fire. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1225.0s)]
*  That's what they call it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1226.0s)]
*  The Ring of Fire when the baby's crowning. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1227.0s)]
*  Yeah no it's crazy and I you know there's so much pressure too I think like you're less [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1230.0s)]
*  of a woman if you it's weird. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1237.0s)]
*  If you get the painkillers. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1240.0s)]
*  No if you get the painkillers or if you get a caesarean. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1242.0s)]
*  No because really. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1246.0s)]
*  Yeah there's there's there's like a lot of competition I think in the in the. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1247.0s)]
*  It's a weird you know like my birth was more natural than your birth out there and I think [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1252.0s)]
*  there's a lot of pressure on women to try and have as natural as a birth as they possibly [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1260.0s)]
*  can. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1265.0s)]
*  And many women go into with their birthing plan. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1266.0s)]
*  My OBGYN laughed at me because I was like my birthing plan is me and the baby live together. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1269.0s)]
*  And the baby lived through the birth. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1275.0s)]
*  He's like honestly that's the best birthing plan to have. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1277.0s)]
*  But so many people go in with a birthing plan as a thing now and they go in and they're [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1281.0s)]
*  like I don't want any drugs in like four hours and they're like get me the drugs. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1286.0s)]
*  Get me the fucking drugs. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1291.0s)]
*  I don't think you could possibly imagine what that pain is like I guess until you experience [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1292.0s)]
*  it. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1297.0s)]
*  I have a lot of friends who have gone bareback with no painkiller. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1298.0s)]
*  And just good women. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1303.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1305.0s)]
*  And they actually most of them are from the Midwest like they're they're my friends from [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1306.0s)]
*  Minnesota. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1310.0s)]
*  They're hardy. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1311.0s)]
*  They're just bad ass in that way. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1312.0s)]
*  I just know myself. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1314.0s)]
*  I know my mom had five C sections. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1315.0s)]
*  So what is that like after the fifth one. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1318.0s)]
*  I don't even know what's that road look like. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1320.0s)]
*  They'll let you. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1322.0s)]
*  Yeah I don't know if they'll even let you do that anymore. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1323.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1327.0s)]
*  Well how would they stop you from doing that. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1328.0s)]
*  Because you can't have vaginal birth after you have a C section. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1330.0s)]
*  Well you can. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1334.0s)]
*  It's called a V back. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1335.0s)]
*  It's a vaginal birth after cesarean. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1336.0s)]
*  And so you nowadays you can. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1338.0s)]
*  And women are often do. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1342.0s)]
*  When did that change? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1344.0s)]
*  Pretty recently I think. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1346.0s)]
*  And it was like a lot of the thinking around it changed that you don't have to. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1347.0s)]
*  It's one cesarean doesn't necessarily mean you have to have a cesarean. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1351.0s)]
*  I think a lot of it depends on like how long ago you had your cesarean. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1354.0s)]
*  But it's all healed up. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1359.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1360.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1361.0s)]
*  How does your abdominal area feel? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1362.0s)]
*  Does it feel like it got cut open? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1365.0s)]
*  Well because they move the muscles. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1368.0s)]
*  So there's definitely some weakness. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1370.0s)]
*  I've been just trying to. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1372.0s)]
*  I started doing kind of like core rehab right away just because I knew it would go into my back carrying around the baby. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1374.0s)]
*  And a lot of people I know have just back issues after cesareans. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1383.0s)]
*  And it definitely feels like especially like the lower abs. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1387.0s)]
*  They just I have a harder time engaging them. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1391.0s)]
*  And it feels weaker. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1394.0s)]
*  Obviously it was six months ago. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1395.0s)]
*  So if and I have a scar she was big. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1397.0s)]
*  She was a she was she was like almost nine pounds. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1401.0s)]
*  She came out like nine pounds. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1405.0s)]
*  That's a that's a solid dumbbell. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1408.0s)]
*  She's yeah. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1411.0s)]
*  She's a how much did you have like if you. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1412.0s)]
*  If you look at your like the baby's nine pounds and then how much other stuff is in there. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1416.0s)]
*  What's the weight of all the you know the placenta. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1423.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1426.0s)]
*  Everything apparently my placenta was like abnormally big too. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1427.0s)]
*  He was like good job. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1430.0s)]
*  That placenta was huge. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1431.0s)]
*  And I mean you're healthy. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1433.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1435.0s)]
*  I maybe I mean I'm 40. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1436.0s)]
*  I had a baby of 43 years old and I want to be clear buzzer. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1438.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1442.0s)]
*  I'm convinced it was like the last egg. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1443.0s)]
*  I want to be very clear that it was a miracle because I think people will hear my story and they'll be like oh I can wait. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1447.0s)]
*  No don't wait don't wait. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1454.0s)]
*  Even if you get your eggs frozen even if it's still so much harder the older you get not to mention if you look at the numbers for chromosomal abnormalities it all goes exponentially up the older you get. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1457.0s)]
*  And men need to know that it goes up for their sperm as well. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1470.0s)]
*  It's not simply the woman's age. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1473.0s)]
*  I got a conversation with a friend of mine who was 49. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1475.0s)]
*  He was thinking about having a kid. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1478.0s)]
*  He's like oh you know it's really more important that the girls younger. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1479.0s)]
*  I know it's not. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1481.0s)]
*  You need to read like like like there's issues when men are older and they start having children. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1482.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1489.0s)]

*  They wanted someone to go to the bathroom. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1970.0s)]

*  Glued themselves to Porsche Museum but needed to go potty. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1972.0s)]
*  Staff simply left turning off heat and lights rather than calling the police. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1974.0s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1979.0s)]
*  Good for you Porsche. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1980.0s)]
*  It's so fucking dumb. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1981.0s)]
*  It's like we're starting the conversation. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1984.0s)]
*  Like the conversation is already happening. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1988.0s)]
*  We shouldn't even be giving them attention honestly. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1990.0s)]
*  No it's a symbol of this TikTok generation. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1992.0s)]
*  It's a symptom of all this nonsense that you're seeing constantly online. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1995.0s)]
*  These people they're trying to get attention with the least amount of work possible. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=1999.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2003.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2006.0s)]
*  Do something productive if you can. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2007.0s)]
*  Do something productive if you care about the climate. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2009.0s)]
*  I'm always screaming about this. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2012.0s)]
*  Get a bunch. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2014.0s)]
*  Organize an international clean up the beach day. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2016.0s)]
*  Take pictures of all the garbage that you collect. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2018.0s)]
*  All over the world post TikToks about it. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2022.0s)]
*  I can be an activist. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2025.0s)]
*  But do something. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2027.0s)]
*  It would be really moving to see how much garbage is on the beach. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2029.0s)]
*  The girls who threw the soup at the Van Gogh they went on Patrick Bette David's podcast. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2034.0s)]
*  He's a brilliant guy. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2038.0s)]
*  He asked them, may I ask what your pronouns are? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2041.0s)]
*  She said her pronouns are she, he, they. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2045.0s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2049.0s)]
*  You don't have to. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2051.0s)]
*  That's perfect. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2052.0s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2053.0s)]
*  That's nonsense. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2054.0s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2055.0s)]
*  You're she, he, and you're they. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2056.0s)]
*  So you're plural. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2058.0s)]
*  You're masculine. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2059.0s)]
*  And you're feminine. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2060.0s)]
*  You're basically a god. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2061.0s)]
*  I don't get it though. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2063.0s)]
*  You don't have to get it. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2067.0s)]
*  They're 20 year old kids. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2068.0s)]
*  They just want attention and they're so happy they're getting attention because they think [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2069.0s)]
*  they're fixing the world by gluing themselves to the wall. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2072.0s)]
*  I would agree except it's all been institutionalized. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2075.0s)]
*  Like people have to put this in their corporate you know emails that they're sending to you. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2079.0s)]
*  They have to like there's policy being written in Europe about energy because of Greta. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2086.0s)]
*  It's not like oh look at these crazy kids and their crazy ideas and it's somehow being [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2094.0s)]
*  captured by their capturing institutions. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2102.0s)]
*  Well it's the thing du jour right? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2105.0s)]
*  It's the thing that people are told they have to concentrate on now. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2109.0s)]
*  But there's still policies and stuff that are. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2115.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2119.0s)]
*  So it's still having real life ramifications. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2120.0s)]
*  It's not like we're like oh those crazy kids. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2123.0s)]
*  It is having real life but it also is over corrections and then there's balances right? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2125.0s)]
*  Like there's a guy that I want to talk to that is covering cobalt mining. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2131.0s)]
*  And cobalt mining is horrific. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2136.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2139.0s)]
*  It is horrific and it is in all of our electronics. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2140.0s)]
*  It's like one of the things that I've been saying about all these people that are tweeting [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2143.0s)]
*  about injustices on the world they're doing it on a phone that was made by slaves. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2145.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2149.0s)]
*  So go down as far as you can go to find like what's the source of the stuff that is in [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2150.0s)]
*  the phone that makes it work. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2156.0s)]
*  It's sourced by slavery. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2158.0s)]
*  All these electric vehicle batteries too. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2160.0s)]
*  I mean what are we going to do with all the technological waste? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2162.0s)]
*  We just like take computers and what do you do with your own computer? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2167.0s)]
*  Well what do you do with all, there's a lot. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2171.0s)]
*  There's a lot to do. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2173.0s)]
*  I would imagine that this is an opportunity for someone to innovate and come up with a [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2174.0s)]
*  way to recycle that stuff and use it in a way. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2179.0s)]
*  But then I was reading about recycling the other day. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2182.0s)]
*  I went down a rabbit hole the other day because I was reading about birds that are swallowing [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2184.0s)]
*  like bottle caps and stuff like that. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2190.0s)]
*  It's a giant issue. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2192.0s)]
*  So then I went down a rabbit hole of seagulls and what cunt seagulls are. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2193.0s)]
*  And seagulls swallowing rabbits and swallowing other birds. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2197.0s)]
*  Seagulls are monsters. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2201.0s)]
*  No they are. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2202.0s)]
*  They're fucking monsters. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2203.0s)]
*  A seagull on the beach out east swept down and took my cousin's sandwich out of her hand [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2204.0s)]
*  while she was eating it. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2210.0s)]
*  This is a true story. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2211.0s)]
*  That's little. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2213.0s)]
*  They'll eat your kid. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2214.0s)]
*  If your kid was small enough they'd swallow your kid. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2215.0s)]
*  They're little opportunist monsters. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2217.0s)]
*  The worst is pelicans. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2220.0s)]
*  Pelicans swallow seagulls. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2221.0s)]
*  They swoop down. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2223.0s)]
*  They take a whole seagull. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2224.0s)]
*  They look like dinosaurs. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2226.0s)]
*  They are dinosaurs. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2227.0s)]
*  They are. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2228.0s)]
*  Whenever you're on the beach and you see them flying by they look like pterodactyls. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2229.0s)]
*  Like little ones. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2233.0s)]
*  Yeah they're spooky animals. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2234.0s)]
*  But they're also awesome. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2235.0s)]
*  So then I went down this rabbit hole of recycling. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2237.0s)]
*  And do you know that it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 5% of plastic gets recycled. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2240.0s)]
*  Even though you say recycled. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2246.0s)]
*  Like you put it in a recycle bin. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2248.0s)]
*  How much actually gets recycled? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2249.0s)]
*  Very very little of it. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2251.0s)]
*  One of the first articles I ever read in the New York Times magazine back when it was good. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2252.0s)]
*  I was in high school and there was a whole article about how recycling is basically bullshit. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2258.0s)]
*  Yeah it's basically bullshit. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2262.0s)]
*  I mean it could work but it doesn't work. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2263.0s)]
*  It could work. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2266.0s)]
*  If you could get all the plastic and there was some sort of a financially feasible way to gather it all up and process it and reuse it. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2267.0s)]
*  It can be done. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2275.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2276.0s)]
*  I mean there's that project that they're doing with the Pacific Garbage Patch where they're scooping up all that stuff and they're converting it into plastic that they use for items. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2277.0s)]
*  Like you can buy like eyeglasses that were made. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2287.0s)]
*  The plastic frames and everything were made with the recycled plastic. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2291.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2295.0s)]
*  Which is cool that they're doing that and then they're actually there's like a way to make it financially viable. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2296.0s)]
*  But overall most of the plastic single use plastic like bottles water bottles and stuff like that. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2302.0s)]
*  It's not being recycled. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2309.0s)]
*  Yeah we stopped using water bottles here. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2310.0s)]
*  We just we have the water filter now and then we have these steel cups. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2312.0s)]
*  I'm contributing man. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2316.0s)]
*  I'm glad. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2317.0s)]
*  Meanwhile I drove an electric car. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2318.0s)]
*  I mean. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2320.0s)]
*  You know that's not providing you know it's not putting out bad emissions but it's also it's like where's the batteries coming from. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2321.0s)]
*  I always think of Thomas Sowell and his like famous quote. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2328.0s)]
*  There are there aren't solutions there are tradeoffs. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2332.0s)]
*  And if you start evaluating everything from that perspective you can I feel like get to more helpful solutions when you know that you're evaluating the tradeoffs. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2335.0s)]
*  Yeah. No Thomas Sowell is brilliant. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2346.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2348.0s)]
*  He really is brilliant. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2349.0s)]
*  But I just apply that you know to life often where it's like OK we're trying to make a decision. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2350.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2355.0s)]
*  And there's going to be some tradeoffs. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2356.0s)]
*  But people don't like tradeoffs right. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2358.0s)]
*  They like binary things. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2360.0s)]
*  This is good. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2361.0s)]
*  This is bad. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2362.0s)]
*  You know it's like abortion is the perfect example of that. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2363.0s)]
*  It is one of those what I call it's a messy human issue. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2366.0s)]
*  Like I am 100 percent in favor of a woman's right to choose. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2370.0s)]
*  However when you get to like late term it gets real weird. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2374.0s)]
*  It gets very like Bill Burr has a fucking amazing bit about it. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2379.0s)]
*  It's brilliant. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2383.0s)]
*  It's an amazing bit. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2384.0s)]
*  He's Bill is brilliant. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2385.0s)]
*  That's the best bit on abortion. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2387.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2389.0s)]
*  It's such a good bit and it's it's highlighting exactly what it is. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2390.0s)]
*  It's like it's a complex issue. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2394.0s)]
*  And like Sowell says it's there's tradeoffs. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2396.0s)]
*  It's not as simple as like you should be able to do this and you should know one should tell you to do that. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2399.0s)]
*  Yes you're right. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2403.0s)]
*  But what about this thing. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2404.0s)]
*  Roe v Wade changed the day I had this woman in a stepman on my podcast and she's brilliant and very she's a lawyer. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2406.0s)]
*  So she has a legal mind and she and I had a really interesting discussion about it and just she said you know if this is morally complex this issue and if you're not kind of confused and torn about it you're not really thinking deeply about it. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2415.0s)]
*  And I do think with the late term abortions it's usually horrific instances when they have it's usually like it's a very small percentage and it's usually something horrible and tragic like the mom doesn't usually I need somebody because whenever people say no people are doing this in the ninth month I'm like OK I need an example of somebody doing this before before I'm just like oh my God people are making this decision. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2433.0s)]
*  But I always thought I always thought I had Chris Williams on my podcast and he asked me if my views on abortion had changed since I had a kid. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2462.0s)]
*  But I think my views had been changing kind of prior not changing necessarily but I always thought it was three months growing up. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2470.0s)]
*  I don't know why I thought this. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2478.0s)]
*  I thought it was three months and then I learned pretty late. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2479.0s)]
*  It's embarrassing that it was like five months and a lot of places and some places you know no limits. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2483.0s)]
*  And I'm definitely squishy about that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2490.0s)]
*  I had a friend in New York and he was kind of fucked up. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2493.0s)]
*  He was he was just a mess like a lot of mental health issues and he was all over the place. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2496.0s)]
*  He could never get his life together is really depressed and is like always like falling apart and trying to get himself back together again and just always a mess. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2503.0s)]
*  And his girlfriend got pregnant and she was pretty far along and he convinced her to get an abortion. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2510.0s)]
*  And he convinced her to get an abortion. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2518.0s)]
*  It was when you can get a late term abortion. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2519.0s)]
*  I mean she was pregnant. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2521.0s)]
*  I mean she was showing. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2523.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2524.0s)]
*  You know I don't know how many months but it was quite a few months and she was horrified by it. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2525.0s)]
*  She didn't want to do it and he kind of forced her into doing it or talked her into doing it. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2528.0s)]
*  And then later they wound up having kids which is even crazier. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2532.0s)]
*  Well yeah it's it's it's wild because it's I mean this was in the 90s early 90s. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2537.0s)]
*  I don't know what the laws were then or what you were allowed to do or not allowed to do but it was he was he was just so fucked up at the time. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2545.0s)]
*  I mean I think he's better now but he's just he had a really bad childhood like physically abused and he was just a mess and he just didn't want to deal with the responsibility and didn't think he could deal with it. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2553.0s)]
*  And you know that's but then again like should you. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2566.0s)]
*  So you're your pro choice. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2572.0s)]
*  I'm 100 percent pro choice. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2574.0s)]
*  But I'm also aware that there's people like that. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2576.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2579.0s)]
*  Where it's I mean that is the rarity right. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2580.0s)]
*  I'm not saying it's the norm. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2582.0s)]
*  I'm not saying there's a bunch of people that are hoping. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2583.0s)]
*  Yeah they're like. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2586.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2587.0s)]
*  Don't want to do this. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2588.0s)]
*  No. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2589.0s)]
*  I'm 100 percent pro choice. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2590.0s)]
*  First of all I am a man and I do not think that it is my right to tell anyone what they can and can't do with their body. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2591.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2599.0s)]
*  But I don't think that that I don't think that it's clear at what point in time it becomes morally morally reprehensible. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2600.0s)]
*  But there becomes a time where it is. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2608.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2610.0s)]
*  I mean and I feel like it's different for everyone. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2611.0s)]
*  You know there's because pro I understand the pro life argument. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2615.0s)]
*  I like completely. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2619.0s)]
*  I do too. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2620.0s)]
*  If you believe it starts at conception and they like in that bit you're kind of interrupting a process that would take place naturally. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2621.0s)]
*  I understand. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2628.0s)]
*  I feel like I've become I guess like and I think honestly most Americans are pretty squishy on it. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2629.0s)]
*  Like in the first three months they're like OK because so much goes wrong anyway. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2637.0s)]
*  It's why people don't even talk about being pregnant a lot of the time for the first trimester. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2642.0s)]
*  But then after that the support for it drastically goes down. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2647.0s)]
*  So as viability goes up on all of the polls those like support for the abortion kind of goes down because it's I think now the late the they have baby they're keeping babies alive. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2652.0s)]
*  They're like 21 weeks I think is the youngest. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2664.0s)]
*  I'm not 100 percent. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2667.0s)]
*  I know that there that's like five months. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2668.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2671.0s)]
*  I mean it was weird that abortion ban in Texas the six week heart ban came down when I was six weeks pregnant. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2672.0s)]
*  And I was six weeks pregnant and heard my daughter's heartbeat. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2681.0s)]
*  What was your thought. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2686.0s)]
*  It was fucked up. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2687.0s)]
*  It was definitely like a weird mind fuck where I was like yeah. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2688.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2692.0s)]
*  Because yeah it's fucked up. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2693.0s)]
*  You know what else is fucked up. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2697.0s)]
*  You know we've talked about this before but there was a when abortion abortion was first made legal in this country or readily available. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2698.0s)]
*  There's a direct correlation 18 years later with a decrease in violent crime. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2707.0s)]
*  And Malcolm Vile was talking about this. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2712.0s)]
*  Freakonomics I think did something about this too. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2714.0s)]
*  Those guys. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2717.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2718.0s)]
*  Where it's like like should you force people to have a child. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2719.0s)]
*  And then you know what are you doing when you're doing that. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2723.0s)]
*  Like is that detrimental to society is it detrimental to those people's lives. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2725.0s)]
*  And then and then here's the big one for me like what when people say that you should never get an abortion. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2730.0s)]
*  What about those instances where the woman's life is in danger. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2735.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2738.0s)]
*  No I hate that. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2739.0s)]
*  That is like incest and rape. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2740.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2742.0s)]
*  Like you're going to force somebody to do this. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2743.0s)]
*  That seems cruel too. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2745.0s)]
*  And this is what this is what Ines and I were talking about was like there's two you know you're balancing the liberty of the mother versus the life of this. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2746.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2757.0s)]
*  Unborn child. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2758.0s)]
*  It's messy. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2759.0s)]
*  It's messy. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2760.0s)]
*  It's really messy. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2761.0s)]
*  And it's definitely she believes like kicking it down to the states is a victory for federalism. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2762.0s)]
*  She's like this should always be you know if there's a state where it has many women are pro life if there's a state where people are voting for this and that's what the people want in their state versus another state then that should be the that is the will of the people in that state [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2769.0s)]
*  which she thinks is a win for democracy. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2786.0s)]
*  But it is a fascinating thing that we're doing here this experiment in self democracy. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2788.0s)]
*  Well you were self government where you do have options where there's different states that do have different laws that apply to almost everything that applies to drugs that applies to you know so many different things you can do and not do like for the longest time Montana didn't have a speed limit. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2792.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2809.0s)]
*  Who gives a fuck. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2811.0s)]
*  Montana. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2812.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2813.0s)]
*  But they had to I think federally they had to change it at one point in time to get funding. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2814.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2818.0s)]
*  But I remember that a friend of mine used to register his cars in Montana like there's because it's like a thing if you buy land in Montana you could just like register cars out there and you know they're basically you could do wild shit out there. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2819.0s)]
*  You saw a lot of people move with their feet in the pandemic. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2832.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2835.0s)]
*  I mean we like me. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2836.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2837.0s)]
*  You had the option. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2838.0s)]
*  You were like I don't like what's happening with the policies and mandates not even voted on here and I'm going somewhere else. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2839.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2847.0s)]
*  And lots of people did that. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2848.0s)]
*  Well I'm not a big believer that things always get better. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2849.0s)]
*  I'm a I'm a optimist but I'm also a realist and I'm you know I grew up kind of without a lot of stability. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2853.0s)]
*  I think we're very similar. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2861.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2863.0s)]
*  So I see danger coming and I'm like I got to get the fuck out of here. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2864.0s)]
*  You guys can stay if you want. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2868.0s)]
*  I hear wolves. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2869.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2870.0s)]
*  And and some people like wolves are my friend. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2871.0s)]
*  Like listen. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2875.0s)]
*  Excuse me they identify as. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2876.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2878.0s)]
*  I just you know I think it's great that we have these options as opposed to a place like Australia where you were fucked. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2879.0s)]
*  Like you you had to obey the land the law of the land and now we're finding out that law of the land was based on bullshit. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2886.0s)]
*  Canada. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2893.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2894.0s)]
*  Canada was the worst. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2895.0s)]
*  And did you see that woman from Alberta that is she's a politician and she's talking about the deal that they made with the World Economic Forum. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2896.0s)]
*  She's like what the fuck are we doing with the world economic. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2904.0s)]
*  Why are we doing that. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2907.0s)]
*  I want to get out of that. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2908.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2909.0s)]
*  All that bad stuff seems so crazy to me. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2910.0s)]
*  A lot of it. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2912.0s)]
*  But it's it is such a blessing in this country that you're able to yes to see that. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2913.0s)]
*  I think that we were I was just talking with a driver on the way over here about how like some things are so instinctually ingrained in us. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2918.0s)]
*  And during the pandemic and unrest people were like I need land. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2928.0s)]
*  Yeah land land land and I need to grow my own food. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2933.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2936.0s)]
*  And bread. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2937.0s)]
*  Everybody was making bread. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2938.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2939.0s)]
*  This is some like ancient shit that gets triggered. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2940.0s)]
*  You're like I need land and bread and food and dig my well deeper so that I have water. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2942.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2948.0s)]
*  Duncan sent me a photograph during the pandemic of the meat aisle at the supermarket that he goes to in like Silver Lake. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2949.0s)]
*  And there was nothing in it. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2955.0s)]
*  There was nothing except like vegan meat. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2957.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2959.0s)]
*  There's stacks of vegan meat. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2960.0s)]
*  But my husband was working at Trader Joe's through the whole pandemic almost. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2961.0s)]
*  And he would send me pictures. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2965.0s)]
*  And he was like this is a really good experiment and what we shouldn't be stocking at Trader Joe's anymore. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2967.0s)]
*  Because it was just like the things that were left over like chocolate hummus. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2972.0s)]
*  I didn't even know they had it. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2978.0s)]
*  I don't think they do anymore. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2979.0s)]
*  Well you know people they buy that stuff because they think it's healthy and they're being hoodwinked. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2981.0s)]
*  That shit is the seed oils is what's in that stuff. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2986.0s)]
*  Seed oils are some of the worst fucking things your body can consume. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2989.0s)]
*  And why seed oils in those vegan patties and. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2992.0s)]
*  There's so many products that have seed oils in them. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2996.0s)]
*  And there's another rabbit hole I've been going down lately about seed oils. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=2999.0s)]
*  Paul Saladino sent me something that that there's some sort of a. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3002.0s)]
*  I'll send it to you Jamie so we could parse through this. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3007.0s)]
*  There's some sort of a correlation between seed oils and macular degeneration. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3009.0s)]
*  Look it causes inflammation and inflammation is fucking terrible for you no matter what. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3014.0s)]
*  And they're they're not designed. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3019.0s)]
*  They're they're not designed they were initially made. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3022.0s)]
*  And this is something that we max. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3026.0s)]
*  How do you say his last name Luca. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3030.0s)]
*  How do you say it. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3032.0s)]
*  Like even sunflower seed oil sunflower seeds terrible for you. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3034.0s)]
*  But don't they use this like in other cultures all over the world. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3037.0s)]
*  Yes it's terrible for you. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3041.0s)]
*  All that stuff was initially invented as industrial oil to like lubricate machines. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3042.0s)]
*  Like a grape seed oil fucking terrible for you. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3049.0s)]
*  All that stuff is terrible for you. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3052.0s)]
*  Here dietary fatty acids macular degeneration here I'll send this to you Jamie. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3054.0s)]
*  They is your thing on your eardrum. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3061.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3064.0s)]
*  They're they're not designed for human consumption. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3065.0s)]
*  Like for you to be able to get oil out of grape seeds. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3069.0s)]
*  There's there's this horrible process. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3073.0s)]
*  Like it was really was like OK we have these leftover seeds. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3075.0s)]
*  What should we do with them. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3079.0s)]
*  And like oh well we can take them to this crazy process and extract oil from them. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3080.0s)]
*  But you have to run through this ridiculous chemical process to take the smell out of them. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3086.0s)]
*  And then here it is. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3092.0s)]
*  I know nothing about that. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3094.0s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3095.0s)]
*  All that stuff's not good for you. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3096.0s)]
*  Like what's good for you is olive oil olive oil and avocado oil. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3097.0s)]
*  Great for you. Good stuff. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3101.0s)]
*  Dietary fatty acids in the 10 year incidence of age related macular degeneration. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3102.0s)]
*  So the objective objective was to assess the relationship between baseline dietary fatty acids and 10 year incident age related macular degeneration. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3107.0s)]
*  And after adjusting for age sex and smoking one serving of fish per week was associated with reduced risk of incident early AMD. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3116.0s)]
*  Primarily among patients with less than medium median linoleic acid consumption finding similar intake of long chain three polyunsaturated fatty acids. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3126.0s)]
*  One to two servings of nuts per week was associated with a reduced risk of incident and AMD. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3137.0s)]
*  Do do do constant projective associations between the intake of nuts and the reduced risk of pigmentary abnormalities we're seeing among non smokers. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3143.0s)]
*  Participants with less than the median ratio of serum total to high density lipoprotein cholesterol and those with beta carotene integrated than the median level. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3153.0s)]
*  So nuts are good. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3164.0s)]
*  Yeah. Nuts are good for you. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3165.0s)]
*  I mean there's there's there's healthy fats and nuts and like the things that you know the things that people think of as healthy like a lot of times are not necessarily healthy. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3166.0s)]
*  And one of those is seed oils. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3177.0s)]
*  The study provides evidence of protection against early AMD from regular eating fish greater consumption of I don't know what that was three polyunsaturated fatty acids and low intake of foods rich in linoleic acid. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3179.0s)]
*  Regular consumption of nuts may also reduce AMD risk joint effects from multiple factors suggested. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3192.0s)]
*  Google the negative effects of seed oils when you go down the rabbit hole. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3200.0s)]
*  First of all they're all highly processed in order to get oil out of a fucking grape seed. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3207.0s)]
*  Like there's this massive process involved with that. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3213.0s)]
*  These aren't natural foods right like olive oil. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3215.0s)]
*  You press it. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3217.0s)]
*  It's like a natural oil and it's also like very good for your body. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3218.0s)]
*  It's like a superfood. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3223.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3224.0s)]
*  And then there's avocado oil. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3225.0s)]
*  There's certain fats that come from from vegetables that are really good for you. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3226.0s)]
*  But those aren't the highly processed ones that were initially designed as industrial machine lubricants which is what's crazy. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3230.0s)]
*  How industrial seed oils are making us sick. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3240.0s)]
*  You said you're having someone on to come talk about this. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3243.0s)]
*  I had someone on recently. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3248.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3250.0s)]
*  How do you say Max's last name. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3251.0s)]
*  The way you said it would be how I would say it. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3253.0s)]
*  Lugover. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3255.0s)]
*  Lugover. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3256.0s)]
*  Lugover. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3257.0s)]
*  I don't want to fuck it up but Max is brilliant. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3258.0s)]
*  And we had him on and he essentially broke it down. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3259.0s)]
*  He's a big proponent of olive oil especially like you know like extra virgin olive oil. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3262.0s)]
*  Experts have presented several dietary culprits as possible explanations for rapidly rising rates of chronic disease in industrialized nations including sugar and saturated fat. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3270.0s)]
*  However one commonly consumed food found in the diets of millions has received surprising little attention. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3281.0s)]
*  Industrial seed oils. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3287.0s)]
*  Wow they're in everything. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3288.0s)]
*  In fucking everything. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3289.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3291.0s)]
*  Contrary to what we've been told industrial seed oils such as soybean canola and corn oils are not heart healthy or otherwise beneficial for our bodies and brains. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3292.0s)]
*  In fact plenty of research indicates these oils are making us sick. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3301.0s)]
*  What are industrial seed oils. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3306.0s)]
*  Unlike traditional fats such as olive oil, coconut oil, butter, ghee and lard industrial seed oils are a very recent addition to the human diet. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3307.0s)]
*  In fact industrial seed oils the highly processed oils extracted from soybeans, corn, rapeseed the source of canola oil, cotton seed and safflower seeds were only introduced into the American diet in the early 1900s. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3315.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3327.0s)]
*  How then did these oils come to occupy such an influential position not only in the standard American diet but in westernized diets around the world. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3328.0s)]
*  I don't eat. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3337.0s)]
*  I don't. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3338.0s)]
*  I eat so clean. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3339.0s)]
*  I'm. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3340.0s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3341.0s)]
*  That's probably why your placenta was so big. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3342.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3344.0s)]
*  I just. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3345.0s)]
*  I didn't necessarily when I was pregnant I gave into a lot of like I just like any combination of cheese and bread. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3346.0s)]
*  I am grilled cheese, mac and cheese, pasta, pizza. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3352.0s)]
*  I just love it. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3357.0s)]
*  But then when she was born she had colic and they there's not really a lot of evidence but they there's a lot of kind of. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3358.0s)]
*  Put that back. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3368.0s)]
*  There's like an old wives tale that if you what you eat can affect their colic because colic is a nightmare. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3369.0s)]
*  And so I just cut out everything except for like proteins and veggies essentially and. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3376.0s)]
*  Well I think this is better overall for your body. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3383.0s)]
*  Well yeah I mean. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3386.0s)]
*  Here is vegetable oils and trans fats which include soybean canola and cottonseed oils as well as hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils undergo extensive heat and chemical processing. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3387.0s)]
*  By the end of that process they are oxidized damaged and cause inflammation to all the tissues in our bodies including our eyes. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3398.0s)]
*  This is about the cases of causes of macular degeneration. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3404.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3408.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3409.0s)]
*  To add insult to injury these types of fats also make their way into most manmade and high sugar foods such as cakes pastries fried foods salad dressings dips margarines and coffee creamers cooking oils and more. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3410.0s)]
*  That makes these food a double whammy of inflammation for our eyes. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3421.0s)]
*  The exclamation point. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3424.0s)]
*  I you know I I like salad. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3425.0s)]
*  I like to eat salads and even when I was like eating carnivore that was the thing that I missed. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3429.0s)]
*  I miss a nice salad like a lot of leafy greens and cucumbers. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3433.0s)]
*  I love salads. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3437.0s)]
*  I like it. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3438.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3439.0s)]
*  If it's not I mean this this argument that it's that salads are bad for you. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3440.0s)]
*  I tend to lean towards the idea that there's a hormetic effect and that whatever you know whatever your body is like that's what Dr. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3443.0s)]
*  Ron DePatrick says that there's like it provides like a stressor to your body that provides a hormetic effect. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3452.0s)]
*  It's actually beneficial. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3458.0s)]
*  What's the argument that they're bad for you. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3459.0s)]
*  I've never heard that there's arguments that the real hardcore carnivore people say. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3461.0s)]
*  And I think much of that probably has to do with some people have a high sensitivity to these plant defense chemicals that some plants do produce. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3466.0s)]
*  Like we know that plants produce chemicals that that that they what they do. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3477.0s)]
*  They're trying to avoid predation. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3483.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3485.0s)]
*  Right. So like certain plants like if you play a recording of caterpillars eating leaves next to plants they will change their chemical profile. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3486.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3495.0s)]
*  And it makes it less delicious. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3496.0s)]
*  So it makes they will literally release chemicals that make their their leaves taste like shit. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3498.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3504.0s)]
*  To the point where they've done these studies where they found that giraffes that are eating certain trees I think it's the acacia tree and they're eating it upwind. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3505.0s)]
*  And so as it as this smell and the sound goes downwind there's some sort of communication that we don't totally understand amongst plants. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3516.0s)]
*  But the trees downwind become inedible. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3524.0s)]
*  Everything is a miracle. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3528.0s)]
*  It's fucking wild. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3529.0s)]
*  It's like that's nature preventing. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3530.0s)]
*  Look the way that Paul Saladino describes it and you know I don't totally buy into all that he's saying but I think a lot of what he's saying makes sense is that animals which are almost all edible their defenses. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3533.0s)]
*  They run away. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3544.0s)]
*  Plants they can't run away. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3545.0s)]
*  So what they do is they release these plants plant defense chemicals. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3547.0s)]
*  Some people are highly sensitive to these. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3551.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3553.0s)]
*  And when you take those into your body some people when they eat certain plants they they have reactions. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3554.0s)]
*  But I think that's like what kind of reaction their body you know they have like an autoimmune reaction. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3561.0s)]
*  Oh OK. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3567.0s)]
*  Like some people that are on like high vegetable high oxalate diets high you know like leafy greens and stuff like that. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3568.0s)]
*  Some people have reactions to them. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3574.0s)]
*  I think that that's probably less common than than the like the hardcore carnivore people believe. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3576.0s)]
*  How long did you do the carnivore diet. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3586.0s)]
*  Oh I generally only do it for a month in January. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3588.0s)]
*  January is World Carnivore Month. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3591.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3593.0s)]
*  So just for a goof a couple of times I've eaten nothing but meat like one. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3594.0s)]
*  Did you get the meat sweats. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3598.0s)]
*  Is that a real thing. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3599.0s)]
*  No I get the meat explosive diarrhea though. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3600.0s)]
*  Dude I had diarrhea that you could write home about. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3603.0s)]
*  Like you write books about diarrhea. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3606.0s)]
*  Like it wasn't just diarrhea it was like oil was coming out like crude like black gold Texas Texas. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3609.0s)]
*  I mean I understand that there's lots of benefits to it and people swear by it but it seems like I don't know. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3617.0s)]
*  I'm not I feel like it takes me a long time to digest like a piece of steak. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3625.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3631.0s)]
*  For me it didn't that didn't bother me. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3632.0s)]
*  I lost a lot of weight but I but I didn't lose weight because I was the diarrhea only lasted a couple of weeks. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3634.0s)]
*  But I mean for a couple of weeks it was touch and go. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3642.0s)]
*  Like it was like I would have a feeling in my stomach like oh Jesus I get to a toilet quick. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3644.0s)]
*  How did you podcast. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3649.0s)]
*  I have strong butt muscles. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3651.0s)]
*  I just keep tight. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3654.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3657.0s)]
*  I did it. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3658.0s)]
*  But but here's the thing. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3659.0s)]
*  It's like when you cut out all the carbs and you cut out particularly bread and pasta which is really for me the culprit. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3660.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3668.0s)]
*  I avoided all the crash and I never felt sleepy. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3669.0s)]
*  Like my energy level was completely sustained all throughout the day. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3672.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3675.0s)]
*  Then when I did it after that I added in fruit. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3676.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3679.0s)]
*  And when I added in fruit I avoided all of the diarrhea all the craziness. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3680.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3684.0s)]
*  So I guess the fiber from the fruit. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3685.0s)]
*  It's just all I was eating was like rib eyes and elk meat. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3687.0s)]
*  The sound elk meat sounds good. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3690.0s)]
*  It's great. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3692.0s)]
*  Rib eyes. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3693.0s)]
*  I needed fat like you can't just eat elk meat. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3694.0s)]
*  You can I'm sure. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3697.0s)]
*  But there's you need fat. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3699.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3701.0s)]
*  And elk is very lean. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3702.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3703.0s)]
*  You know you're basically eating a super athlete. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3704.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3705.0s)]
*  You're eating a super athlete that's running away from mountain lions. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3706.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3708.0s)]
*  They're fucking jacked. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3709.0s)]
*  And so when you when you butcher an elk like when you're in the field and you butcher an elk you see very little fat. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3710.0s)]
*  Very very little. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3716.0s)]
*  Mostly what you're seeing is muscle tissue and I mean and it's it's a dense rich dark red muscle tissue of and it's so rich in protein and vitamins and so fucking healthy for you. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3717.0s)]
*  But you need fat. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3729.0s)]
*  So I would use I would use tallow beef tallow that was grass fed beef tallows. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3730.0s)]
*  I would cook it in that so I'd get some fats from that. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3737.0s)]
*  But I found that I like I started eating a lot of bacon with it and that helped too. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3740.0s)]
*  So when I'm eating this sounds really bad for your heart. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3744.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3747.0s)]
*  That's that's that's a myth. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3748.0s)]
*  Is that a myth. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3750.0s)]
*  Yeah that's a myth. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3751.0s)]
*  That's definitely a myth. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3752.0s)]
*  I mean I think for some people genetically they're predisposed to certain heart conditions and certain cholesterol issues. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3753.0s)]
*  It doesn't like build up. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3759.0s)]
*  No no no no no no. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3761.0s)]
*  No see this is that thing. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3762.0s)]
*  It's like you have this like sort of like what is it is that bad for all the studies that point to meat being bad for your heart or what's called epidemiology studies and those studies where it's where they make people fill out like a questionnaire like how many times a week do you eat meat. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3764.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3781.0s)]
*  Like five days a week. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3782.0s)]
*  And this and they looked at those people and they said oh there's higher instances of heart disease in those people. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3783.0s)]
*  But what they don't cover is how many of those fucking people are eating cheeseburgers. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3788.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3793.0s)]
*  And how many of those people have industrial seed oils in the cheeseburger and the bun and the fries which are cooked in industrial seed oil. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3794.0s)]
*  And how many of them are eating Coca Cola drinking Coca Cola all day long. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3801.0s)]
*  Which is filled with fucking seed oils. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3805.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3809.0s)]
*  And corn corn syrup like all that shit is what's really bad for you. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3810.0s)]
*  Well you know about the studies that were done in I think it was the 1950s or 1960s where the sugar industry paid scientists to lie about the source of heart disease and connected to saturated fats. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3814.0s)]
*  And it was it was really just bribery. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3829.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3832.0s)]
*  And they didn't pay him much. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3833.0s)]
*  They paid him like fifty thousand dollars. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3834.0s)]
*  And in paying them that fifty thousand dollars. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3836.0s)]
*  See if you can find that because the New York Times wrote about this. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3838.0s)]
*  So people have this idea that that meat is bad for you. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3841.0s)]
*  Well I mean it is what people have been eating since the fucking beginning of time. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3845.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3849.0s)]
*  I remember reading that like the whole idea that fat was bad for you is because of the sugar lobbies and then they just replaced all of the fat with sugar. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3850.0s)]
*  And then now we have an obesity epidemic. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3859.0s)]
*  And I do think there's part of the problem with like we have a problem. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3862.0s)]
*  I mean even flying lately I'm like oh my god every single flight I've been on they need like seven wheelchairs. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3867.0s)]
*  You know it's it's just seems more than ever before. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3875.0s)]
*  People are are struggling with obesity and I think it's obviously been proven. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3879.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of it too is just like confusion about what they should eat. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3885.0s)]
*  Yeah. I feel like there's so much confusion around food. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3891.0s)]
*  That's not really confusion. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3894.0s)]
*  There is confusion but it's also like that stuff's delicious and it tricks your body and you need the Cheetos. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3895.0s)]
*  Go back to the top please. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3901.0s)]
*  So this is 50 years ago sugar industry quietly paid scientists to point the blame at fat. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3903.0s)]
*  Did anybody get punished for this? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3907.0s)]
*  I think they're all dead. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3909.0s)]
*  Luckily. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3911.0s)]
*  But this is also part of the problem. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3912.0s)]
*  We have the ability for this crap to happen. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3915.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3918.0s)]
*  Well it happens less and less now because the Internet because this stuff can get out. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3919.0s)]
*  But yeah the next year after several scientific articles were published suggesting a link between sucrose and coronary heart disease. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3922.0s)]
*  The SRF approved the literature review project and it wound up paying approximately fifty thousand dollars in today's dollars for the research. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3928.0s)]
*  One of the researchers was chairman of Harvard's public health nutrition department an ad hoc member of SRF board. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3936.0s)]
*  So they they literally paid these scientists to conduct this bullshit study because there was all sorts of articles scientific articles suggesting a link between sugar and coronary heart disease. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3944.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3955.0s)]
*  They recommended that the industry fund its own studies which is then we can publish data and refute our detractors. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3956.0s)]
*  Someone got fifty thousand dollars to destroy America. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3963.0s)]

*  I mean how many people took margarine because they thought that margin was good for you. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3970.0s)]
*  There's so that's what I mean though about the confusion. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3974.0s)]
*  I think that people are eating I don't know what's in these impossible burgers and all this like beyond meat stuff. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3976.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3991.0s)]
*  Well I can fucking believe it tastes like shit. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3992.0s)]

*  Butters delicious. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=3999.0s)]
*  I can't believe it's not butter. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4000.0s)]
*  I can believe it. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4001.0s)]
*  Someone who's never tried butter. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4002.0s)]

*  The fuck is wrong with you. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4005.0s)]
*  Find like find out that the impossible burger thing where they were they found that there was a correlation between rat rat liver damage. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4007.0s)]
*  Fucking rats. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4016.0s)]
*  Rats eat rats. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4018.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4022.0s)]
*  They eat an impossible burger. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4023.0s)]
*  They're going to the fucking hospital ward. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4024.0s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4026.0s)]
*  No. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4027.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4028.0s)]
*  Rat feeding study suggests the impossible burger may not be safe to eat. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4029.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4032.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4033.0s)]
*  Because it's not. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4034.0s)]
*  Look first of all. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4035.0s)]
*  But what is in it. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4036.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4037.0s)]
*  Well we'll tell you what's in it. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4038.0s)]
*  Here it goes. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4039.0s)]
*  Impossible burgers a plant based burger the key ingredient which protein called soy leg hemoglobin SLH for short derived from genetically modified yeast. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4042.0s)]
*  It's already being sold in restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4054.0s)]
*  In 2019 the manufacturing company Impossible Foods applied for permission to market the burger in the EU and the UK. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4057.0s)]
*  Did the EU let it in. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4064.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4066.0s)]
*  They're usually pretty strict about this stuff. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4067.0s)]
*  But this is all genetically modified bullshit. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4069.0s)]
*  The results of the rat feeding study commissioned by Impossible Foods and carried out with SLH suggested the burger may not be safe to eat. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4071.0s)]
*  SLH is a substitute that gives the burger its meaty taste. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4079.0s)]
*  It makes it appear to bleed like meat when cut. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4083.0s)]
*  The U.S. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4086.0s)]
*  Food Department and Drug Administration initially refused to sign off the safety of SLH when it first approached by the company. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4087.0s)]
*  The rat feeding study results suggest that the agency's concerns were justified. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4094.0s)]
*  Rats fed the GM yeast derived SLH developed unexplained changes in weight gain changes in the blood that can indicate the onset of inflammation or kidney disease. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4098.0s)]
*  And possible signs of anemia. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4110.0s)]
*  What the? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4112.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4113.0s)]
*  Listen if you don't like meat and you don't want to eat meat there's plenty of plant based protein sources. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4114.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4120.0s)]
*  Like pea protein is very good for you. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4121.0s)]
*  Hemp protein is very good for you. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4122.0s)]
*  You don't have to eat fake meat. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4124.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4126.0s)]
*  If you miss meat have a burger. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4127.0s)]
*  Have a burger from a cow that was a cunt. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4129.0s)]
*  It's like only cunty cows. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4132.0s)]
*  Cows that like kick farmers and fucking stomp on their babies. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4134.0s)]
*  Surely there must be cows that deserve being eaten. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4137.0s)]
*  There's some that's like eating bugs and the impossible meat and all of this stuff. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4140.0s)]
*  It just feels very strange. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4146.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4148.0s)]
*  The push for it. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4149.0s)]
*  It's like this unified push for it that feels the bug doesn't bother me. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4150.0s)]
*  Well bugs are good protein. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4155.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4157.0s)]
*  Maybe because I hosted Fear Factor. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4158.0s)]
*  But I've eaten bugs. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4159.0s)]
*  I've eaten bugs. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4160.0s)]
*  I've eaten a lot of bugs. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4161.0s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4162.0s)]
*  But cricket protein is actually good for you. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4163.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4165.0s)]
*  And it's an easy source of protein. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4166.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4168.0s)]
*  You know what's fucked up about that? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4169.0s)]
*  I've eaten cricket protein but if I find a cricket in my house I always save it. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4170.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4173.0s)]
*  There's certain bugs that if you're in my house. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4174.0s)]
*  I save crickets. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4176.0s)]
*  You're dead. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4177.0s)]
*  There's certain bugs where you don't live if you're a roach. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4178.0s)]
*  If you're a roach I'm going to fuck you up. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4180.0s)]
*  Do they have a lot of protein? [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4182.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4183.0s)]
*  I've eaten them. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4184.0s)]
*  I ate a roach. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4185.0s)]
*  I went to this thing in New Zealand and it was like this, I forget even what it was called. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4186.0s)]
*  And it's one of those things where you eat all kinds, I ate a grub. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4193.0s)]
*  They took it out of the wood and I ate it. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4196.0s)]
*  It's kind of flavorless, right? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4199.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's just that moving around in your mouth. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4201.0s)]
*  And they had all kinds of weird things to eat and it was just a New Zealand thing. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4204.0s)]
*  And one of the things was horse semen. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4209.0s)]
*  And I drank horse semen. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4212.0s)]
*  They were giving shots of it. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4214.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4216.0s)]
*  Little shots of it. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4217.0s)]
*  I think they lied to you. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4218.0s)]
*  I don't think that has anything to do with bugs, Bridget. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4219.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4221.0s)]
*  I was still drinking back then and I was pretty drunk. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4222.0s)]
*  I went to a resort in Mexico and they had these little, crickets are grasshoppers. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4226.0s)]
*  I forget now. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4234.0s)]
*  I think it was crickets. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4236.0s)]
*  But they had stir-fried crickets in a salty sort of based, like a teriyaki type of thing. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4237.0s)]
*  And they were delicious. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4245.0s)]
*  And they were in a bowl. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4246.0s)]
*  And my kids were really young at the time. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4248.0s)]
*  They were like, ew! [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4250.0s)]
*  And I'm like, they're not bad. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4251.0s)]
*  And I was eating them. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4252.0s)]
*  I ate them all. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4253.0s)]
*  They were pretty good. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4254.0s)]
*  And when I was in Japan, in Kyoto, we went to this fancy dinner and they had these little, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4255.0s)]
*  they were like minnows that were kind of, they were like french fries. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4261.0s)]
*  They were delicious. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4265.0s)]
*  But they were full little minnows with little eyes. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4266.0s)]
*  Well, minnows are good. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4269.0s)]
*  That's smelt. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4270.0s)]
*  Have you ever had smelt? [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4271.0s)]
*  In the East Coast, when I lived in Boston, my friends would go smelting. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4273.0s)]
*  And smelt are these tiny little fish. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4277.0s)]
*  You just eat them whole. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4279.0s)]
*  And they, I forget how they catch them, but you can't catch them with a hook. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4281.0s)]
*  They're just too small. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4284.0s)]
*  But they would get like tons of them and cook them. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4285.0s)]
*  And they were delicious. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4288.0s)]
*  And they're these little tiny things. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4289.0s)]
*  You just eat them whole. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4291.0s)]
*  But crickets and bugs, like we have a thing in our head about bugs. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4292.0s)]
*  But that's what a fucking lobster is. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4297.0s)]

*  Right? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4304.0s)]
*  They're essentially bugs. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4305.0s)]
*  Like divers, they call them bugs. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4306.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4309.0s)]
*  Like we're diving for bugs. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4310.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4311.0s)]
*  It's not really the bug thing that weirds me out. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4312.0s)]
*  It's the like unified push for everyone to eat bugs that weirds me out. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4318.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4324.0s)]
*  I'm like, you're not going to make me eat freaking bugs and live in a pod. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4325.0s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4328.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4330.0s)]
*  It's that you will have nothing and you'll be happy. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4331.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4333.0s)]
*  But like a great reset or whatever. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4334.0s)]
*  I'm like, why do I feel like I'm going to be on the shit end of this reset? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4336.0s)]
*  Well, you 100% will. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4340.0s)]
*  They'll be on a yacht eating caviar and foie gras. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4341.0s)]
*  And you'll be eating bugs in a hobble somewhere. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4344.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4346.0s)]
*  Some little freaking pod. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4347.0s)]
*  Cockroach milk is protein rich, crystallized substance produced by a specific type of cockroach [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4349.0s)]
*  called diploptera punctata. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4354.0s)]
*  The species is unique because it gives birth to live offspring. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4361.0s)]
*  Members make milk in the form of protein crystals to serve as food for the developing young. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4364.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4370.0s)]
*  I'm not opposed to eating bugs because there's a thing amongst like hunters and conservationists [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4371.0s)]
*  where they harvest cicadas. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4378.0s)]
*  And when they have like those big cicada hatches, people harvest them and they bake them. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4380.0s)]
*  And like my friend Ryan Callahan posted on he has a podcast. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4385.0s)]
*  What is this podcast called? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4390.0s)]
*  Cal's fucking find this podcast. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4393.0s)]
*  But he Cal's Week in Review and it's a great podcast. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4396.0s)]
*  It's all about like different things that have to do with nature and conservation and stuff like that. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4400.0s)]
*  But cicadas are delicious. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4405.0s)]
*  They have more than 100 grams per pound according to inverse. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4407.0s)]
*  Of course, you might find it more palatable to eat a big steak. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4411.0s)]
*  But eating it. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4414.0s)]
*  But but they know how to cook them. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4415.0s)]
*  And when they cook them, they act like Ryan said they're really good. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4417.0s)]
*  Everybody just have to know how to prepare them and harvest them. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4420.0s)]
*  But isn't there a bug apocalypse? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4424.0s)]
*  Or have you read about this? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4426.0s)]
*  This is a rabbit hole. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4428.0s)]
*  I've been going down the bug apocalypse. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4429.0s)]
*  Google the bug apocalypse. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4431.0s)]
*  Please, Jamie. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4433.0s)]
*  Oh, there's so many apocalypses. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4435.0s)]
*  There's so many apocalypses. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4437.0s)]
*  Insect apocalypse. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4440.0s)]
*  A growing body of scientific evidence shows that bugs worldwide are decreasing in abundance and diversity. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4441.0s)]
*  No, this is a rabbit hole. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4446.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4448.0s)]
*  Scientists estimate that 40 percent of known species are declining and hypothesize that losses could trigger large scale ecological collapse. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4449.0s)]
*  This is a huge problem. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4457.0s)]
*  But this is why I'm like, why are we pushing bugs? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4458.0s)]
*  I thought there was a bug apocalypse. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4460.0s)]
*  It's just not getting as much attention as the other apocalypse. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4462.0s)]
*  Well, when they're pushing bugs, they're pushing harvesting bugs and raising them for consumption. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4466.0s)]
*  But they could do that pretty easily. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4473.0s)]
*  That's the reason why they want to do that is because resource wise, it's a fairly easier thing. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4475.0s)]
*  You don't need as much land to make. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4483.0s)]
*  I know. I know. I've interviewed a lot of the bug people. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4487.0s)]
*  Have you? [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4489.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4490.0s)]
*  Who have you interviewed that's interesting? [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4491.0s)]
*  There's this one. I have to remember a name. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4492.0s)]
*  I did this thing where I interviewed, I swear, it was like 20 people every five minutes. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4494.0s)]
*  I interviewed a different person. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4499.0s)]
*  And one of the women was someone who's building the technology to have these bug pods in your house so you can eat the bugs. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4501.0s)]
*  And I have to, I can look it up. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4509.0s)]
*  What did you do every 20 minutes? [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4512.0s)]
*  It was a... [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4514.0s)]
*  Speed interviews? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4516.0s)]
*  No, it felt like that. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4517.0s)]
*  It felt like that. It was, I did, I have like, mom brain is real. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4518.0s)]
*  It's a real thing. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4524.0s)]
*  You need some alpha brain. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4525.0s)]
*  Can I take it? I'm breastfeeding. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4527.0s)]
*  I don't want to be responsible for a kid becoming a super genius. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4529.0s)]
*  But alpha brain is a nootropic that my company Onnit makes. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4533.0s)]
*  And I'm not saying this because it's my company, because it's nootropics and it's the reason why we started Onnit. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4537.0s)]
*  When Aubrey and I started Onnit 10, 11 years ago, whatever it was, the reason why we started it was because I got fascinated with nootropics. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4544.0s)]
*  And I got into, there's a thing called Neuro One that Bill Romanowski, the football player, developed because he was having problems with CTE and memory loss. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4551.0s)]
*  And so there's certain nootropics, which are nutrients that are the building blocks for human neurotransmitters. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4560.0s)]
*  And you can take those and they can enhance memory. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4567.0s)]
*  And it's very controversial. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4570.0s)]
*  A lot of people call bullshit and snake oil. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4571.0s)]
*  But we funded two double blind placebo controlled studies with the Boston Center for Memory that showed increase in verbal memory, increase in your reaction times and your your it's essentially it helps your ability to form sentences. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4573.0s)]
*  Come up with like when I do the UFC, which is like the time where it's the most memory intensive for me, because I have to recall techniques and moves. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4587.0s)]
*  And when it happened, when I always take AlphaBrain, I take it for every time I have to talk to a scientist. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4597.0s)]
*  I take this shit. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4602.0s)]
*  I was wondering how you talk to these guys. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4603.0s)]
*  I but I was reading about mom brain and they're starting to really study it and you lose gray matter. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4605.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4612.0s)]
*  The resources that the baby needs to do your belt making a fucking human. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4613.0s)]
*  But they also think it's because they their theory is that it's so you can have more attention for the baby. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4617.0s)]
*  So your attention just goes not as many other places and more resources are given so you can connect to the baby. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4624.0s)]
*  That makes sense. Yeah. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4633.0s)]
*  But I mean, I have been I usually am pretty I struggle to like find basic words. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4634.0s)]
*  I couldn't remember the word assessment on the way over here. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4639.0s)]
*  I do that all the time, though, especially when I wake up when if you catch me and the reason why I do a podcast, I will ask Jason, the CEO, what studies have done on that. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4642.0s)]
*  But not just this stuff, but there's also stuff called neuro gum that I don't have any association with other than I purchase it in neuro gum. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4652.0s)]
*  We have boxes of it over there. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4659.0s)]
*  I chew that shit all the time. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4660.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that has it also has nootropics in it and a little bit of caffeine. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4661.0s)]
*  You gave me some of that actually once when I was here and I used it all the time. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4665.0s)]
*  I love that stuff. It's amazing. It really did help me feel like on it and sharp. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4670.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's real. Yeah. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4674.0s)]
*  It's neuro. What is in this? [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4676.0s)]
*  Nootropics. It's it's real science. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4678.0s)]
*  It's not horse shit or snake oil or placebos. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4680.0s)]
*  It's real. Yeah. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4683.0s)]
*  And again, there's there's many different versions of it. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4684.0s)]
*  There's this is my favorite alpha brain black label. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4687.0s)]
*  This stuff is the shit. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4690.0s)]
*  It's the best of anyone that I've ever tried. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4692.0s)]
*  But I do really like neuro one neuro one. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4694.0s)]
*  I like to because it's a powder. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4697.0s)]
*  You scoop it. I put it in like a jug of shake it in water. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4699.0s)]
*  It tastes good. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4703.0s)]
*  I love the gum. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4705.0s)]
*  And there's a bunch of other ones that are available to the different companies sell and they have different effects. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4706.0s)]
*  But all of them are designed to enhance memory. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4712.0s)]
*  I need it right now. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4715.0s)]
*  I keep the mind sharp. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4716.0s)]
*  There's like it makes sense. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4718.0s)]
*  Right. Like there's neurotransmitters. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4720.0s)]
*  There's building blocks for those neurotransmitters. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4722.0s)]
*  We know that 5HTP helps you produce serotonin. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4724.0s)]
*  And there's all these different things that can enhance the function of the brain. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4727.0s)]
*  And for me, that's all I have. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4732.0s)]
*  I'm a dumb dude, but I have a good memory. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4734.0s)]
*  But one of the reasons why I have a good memory is because I use a good memory. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4736.0s)]
*  Pretty good. It's good. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4740.0s)]
*  Most of the time, especially considering how much we just know. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4741.0s)]
*  Yeah. This month is not any better. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4745.0s)]
*  Like my brain is not any better. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4747.0s)]
*  But I think I don't think the weed fucks with my short term memory for sure. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4749.0s)]
*  When I quit smoking weed at first, my brain was fried and I was like, oh, I don't think weed affects you at all. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4754.0s)]
*  And then I was waiting tables, which requires a lot of memory. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4760.0s)]
*  And suddenly I was remembering everyone's name. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4764.0s)]
*  Like it was like my brain came back online, but it took like three months. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4767.0s)]
*  It wasn't like after 30 days. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4771.0s)]
*  I think weed takes a while to like get out of your system. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4773.0s)]
*  You know what definitely happens when you stop smoking weed is you dream. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4777.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. My dreams are amazing. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4781.0s)]
*  My dreams. The moment I stopped smoking weed this month, like within a couple of days, I started having wild dreams. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4783.0s)]
*  And they're all like very violent. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4790.0s)]
*  They're all like wolves chasing you and shit, falling off cliffs. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4792.0s)]
*  And it's like war. I have war dreams. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4797.0s)]
*  Everybody's talking about Civil War, though. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4800.0s)]
*  That's just like in the zeitgeist. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4802.0s)]
*  And I'm always like America's too fat for a Civil War. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4804.0s)]
*  I don't have Civil War dreams. I have war dreams. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4807.0s)]
*  Like big war dreams? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4809.0s)]
*  Yeah, like hiding in apartment buildings and seeing soldiers enter into the building and trying to figure out how to get out. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4810.0s)]
*  I've had a recurring dream for years. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4816.0s)]
*  I've talked about this, but maybe not here. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4818.0s)]
*  But I've had it for years and I'm in New York City. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4821.0s)]
*  And then there's like this gas that starts coming up through the manholes. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4825.0s)]
*  And I'm like, they're gassing us. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4829.0s)]
*  And then everybody gets like paralyzed and we're all just staring at each other and we're conscious, but we can't move. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4831.0s)]
*  And it's the Chinese. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4836.0s)]
*  And the Chinese are occupying the United States. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4838.0s)]
*  And they're like somehow I end up getting free of my paralyzation. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4842.0s)]
*  And then I'm running through the woods in Connecticut, which I used to live in Connecticut. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4847.0s)]
*  So it's very familiar, the woods there all the way to Rhode Island. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4852.0s)]
*  And then I get to my grandmother's house and we stage a defense against the Chinese soldiers who are coming and we're hiding. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4857.0s)]
*  And then I wake up when they knock on the door of the attic. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4864.0s)]
*  Like I've had this dream like four times, four or five in recently. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4867.0s)]
*  But I've been having it for years. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4873.0s)]
*  And it's always the same. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4875.0s)]
*  Like I'm in my grandma's house and then they're like, we're trying to hide. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4878.0s)]
*  How much are you worried about an actual situation like that happening? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4882.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4885.0s)]
*  Everything's so weird. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4886.0s)]
*  Elon took over Twitter today. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4888.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4890.0s)]
*  Like we live in a simulation. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4891.0s)]
*  No, that's the best. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4892.0s)]
*  That crazy bastard did it. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4893.0s)]
*  How about when he walked into Twitter's headquarters with a sink and said, let that sink in. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4895.0s)]
*  A dad joke. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4899.0s)]
*  Yes, that's him. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4901.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4903.0s)]
*  He's funny. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4904.0s)]
*  We have like this ongoing bet on Dumpster Fire that he's my nemesis. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4905.0s)]
*  And it started because of my husband, who we were doing one of these dumb books. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4908.0s)]
*  Someone got us. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4913.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, you can like connect as a couple. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4914.0s)]
*  And we were jokingly kind of ironically in our Gen X way doing it. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4916.0s)]
*  And it was like, what's something you would like always want to do or something like that? [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4921.0s)]
*  He was like, have dinner with Elon Musk. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4926.0s)]
*  And I was like, it was supposed to be something about me. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4928.0s)]
*  And I was like, fuck you. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4931.0s)]
*  You're going to have dinner with Elon, not have dinner with me. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4932.0s)]
*  And so it became his ongoing joke because of him being my nemesis. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4935.0s)]
*  But it's really. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4939.0s)]
*  Why is he what made him the nemesis? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4940.0s)]
*  A, because it's hilarious because I'm a nobody and he's a genius buying Twitter [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4942.0s)]
*  and sending rockets to space and trying to get to Mars. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4947.0s)]
*  And I'm screaming in a garage on Dumpster Fire. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4951.0s)]
*  So there's that hilarious aspect. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4954.0s)]
*  But it's mostly just because he's my. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4956.0s)]
*  It became this ongoing joke because my husband started joking about his like, you know, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4959.0s)]
*  enamored, being enamored with Elon Musk. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4964.0s)]
*  And so I was just jealous. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4967.0s)]
*  So it became like it's just become this ongoing. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4969.0s)]
*  And then somebody sent us an Elon cutout for the set. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4972.0s)]
*  And whenever we do an Elon is my nemesis, I'm like, my nemesis is up to it. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4975.0s)]
*  What's he up to now? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4981.0s)]
*  And we like bring the cutout on for the for the bit. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4982.0s)]
*  Well, we're hoping we can get our girl Megan re-established. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4985.0s)]
*  Free Megan. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4989.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4990.0s)]
*  Free Megan Murphy. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4991.0s)]
*  Free Megan. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4992.0s)]
*  There's so many. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4993.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4994.0s)]
*  People were like so many people that need to be reestablished. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4995.0s)]
*  I mean, James Lindsay got booted, I think. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4997.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=4999.0s)]
*  And somebody was like, this is like when the Joker let all the all the all the prisoners out. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5000.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not. It's not because it's not the Joker. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5007.0s)]
*  Well, if you see them as like political prisoners, it might be. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5009.0s)]
*  Those are crazy, paranoid people that have been also they've been enjoying the fact that it's an ideological thought bubble. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5014.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5021.0s)]
*  The leader has only enforced left left wing ideologies and they've suppressed any conservative ideologies, even amongst reasonable kind people that don't share the same ideology. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5022.0s)]
*  That's fucking bad for our society. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5034.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5036.0s)]
*  It's bad. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5037.0s)]
*  I'm not a huge proponent of like the parallel economies either. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5038.0s)]
*  You know, I just I don't know that it's good. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5042.0s)]
*  You know, you. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5045.0s)]
*  What do you mean by parallel economies? [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5046.0s)]
*  This is like the term that everybody's using, particularly on the right, because and it's it's valid as these places like PayPal and financial institutions are saying you can't, you know, if you say this or step out of line, we're going to fine you. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5047.0s)]
*  There's this idea that you're going to have to create a parallel economy in order to function, essentially. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5063.0s)]
*  So don't give don't give your money to I mean, I think the Daily Wire did it with the Razors. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5070.0s)]
*  They had like Harry's. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5075.0s)]
*  Yeah, they did. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5076.0s)]
*  And Jeremy did some Razors. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5077.0s)]
*  So it's like, oh, don't give your money to people who hate you. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5079.0s)]
*  Give your money to people who share your ideology. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5082.0s)]
*  But then you have these, you know, the silos are forming where it's like, then everyone's over here and everyone who agrees is over here and no one's forced to actually articulate their ideas or disagree with one another. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5086.0s)]
*  It's just everyone like smelling their own farts. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5100.0s)]
*  It is though. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5104.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's not healthy. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5110.0s)]
*  No, that's what Elon wants to bring back to Twitter is reasonable exchange of ideas. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5112.0s)]
*  That's like he really thinks it's important. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5119.0s)]
*  It is important. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5121.0s)]
*  I think it's important, too. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5123.0s)]
*  But it's just rare that someone is that wealthy. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5124.0s)]
*  That they can do that. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5126.0s)]
*  That can do that. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5127.0s)]
*  And also he was very left leaning for most of his life until really recently, the pandemic in particular and the way people have sort of enforced these ideologies, regardless of whether or not the science supports it. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5128.0s)]
*  And he thinks it's bad. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5140.0s)]
*  And I think it's true. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5142.0s)]
*  I think I think we have a real problem with discourse, particularly like discourse on Twitter. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5143.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5148.0s)]
*  Like if you post something and then someone posts something that opposes what you say, like, ah, and then you got to like formulate it. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5149.0s)]
*  Like some people don't want that. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5154.0s)]
*  So what they would like to do is silence the people that have opposing viewpoints. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5156.0s)]
*  And then you get all this positive feedback from all the people that agree with you. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5160.0s)]
*  Yes, I want to amplify that because that feels good. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5164.0s)]
*  I did the right. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5167.0s)]
*  I said the right thing. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5168.0s)]
*  I said the right. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5169.0s)]
*  And then when someone comes in with facts or opinion, fuck you, you Nazi fascist. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5170.0s)]
*  And it's like that's what people are doing now, because it's a shit way to communicate. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5173.0s)]
*  Communicating like that. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5177.0s)]
*  It's good. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5179.0s)]
*  It's a good way to get out information and ideas really quickly. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5180.0s)]
*  But it's a bad way to exchange ideas and to dialogue about stuff because it's the way people are supposed to really communicate is like how we're doing. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5182.0s)]
*  Two people looking at each other talking. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5191.0s)]
*  That's how we're designed. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5193.0s)]
*  We're not really designed to read text. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5194.0s)]
*  No. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5197.0s)]
*  How many times have people gotten in fights because there was a misunderstanding on text? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5198.0s)]
*  And yet people can't. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5202.0s)]
*  And then there's so much projection that happens online. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5204.0s)]
*  It's so much of like whatever your insecurities might be, whatever. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5206.0s)]
*  You're not getting that information like you get in real time when you're talking to somebody. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5210.0s)]
*  You're not seeing somebody might be getting sensitive or maybe they're you know, you just see it in stand up where you get that feedback in real time. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5215.0s)]
*  You're like, oh, we're in a dodgy part of town right now. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5223.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5227.0s)]
*  But you don't get that online. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5228.0s)]
*  And then you're just there's so much like projection of people's trauma and people's insecurities and wounds. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5229.0s)]
*  And it just ends up hurting. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5238.0s)]
*  You know, people are people are really hurting. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5241.0s)]
*  People are losing their minds. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5243.0s)]
*  I think people I'm worried about everyone's mental health. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5245.0s)]
*  Well, Twitter is basically a mental health institution where the inmates are giving life advice. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5248.0s)]
*  You say this all the time. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5254.0s)]
*  And I love it. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5256.0s)]
*  You said I read someone quote you. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5258.0s)]
*  It was like Twitter is a mental health institute institution where all the mental patients are like throwing shit at each other. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5261.0s)]
*  That's what they did. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5268.0s)]
*  They're throwing shit at each other. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5270.0s)]
*  They're trying to like, yeah, they're trying to stick it on you. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5271.0s)]
*  You always say don't read the comments. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5274.0s)]
*  And one comment after my last time here came through and I was laughing at it. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5276.0s)]
*  It was like these two. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5280.0s)]
*  It's like watching someone play ping pong against themselves. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5282.0s)]
*  I know it was meant as an insult, but I'm like, yeah, yeah, it's kind of true. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5288.0s)]
*  We agree a lot. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5291.0s)]
*  Why is that bad? [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5293.0s)]
*  It's not bad to agree with people either. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5295.0s)]
*  I try very hard to look at other people's perspectives. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5297.0s)]
*  I really do. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5299.0s)]
*  And I also realize that I have a very weird situation where my my voice gets amplified way above where it's just you're not in a garage like I am and dumpster fire. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5301.0s)]
*  What even you? [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5311.0s)]
*  I mean, you've got a lot of fucking people listen. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5312.0s)]
*  A lot of people watch. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5314.0s)]
*  That's that's way more than most people. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5315.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5317.0s)]
*  When you have an idea and that idea resonates with people, it gets spread. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5318.0s)]
*  And then, you know, the thing like I had this discussion the other day with someone where we're talking about with ideas that people disagree with the one of the problems is like if you put something out and you say something, people are listening. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5321.0s)]
*  They disagree, but they don't have a voice like if they're people listening to us right now. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5337.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5341.0s)]
*  That's not why. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5342.0s)]
*  The reason why is marginalized people. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5343.0s)]
*  You see the other day where Biden said that fucking airplane seats are racist. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5346.0s)]
*  Did you see what he said? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5351.0s)]
*  No, he's so crazy. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5353.0s)]
*  He's doing this thing where you just say something and say, especially people of color. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5355.0s)]
*  People of color. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5361.0s)]
*  You can say that like an effect. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5362.0s)]
*  People low income people and people of color. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5364.0s)]
*  Like he likes to do that because it's like this liberal talking point that you can attach. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5366.0s)]
*  And if you disagree with that, well, they're racist. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5371.0s)]
*  You're racist or you're not sensitive to people of color. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5373.0s)]
*  So he was talking about airline seats and leg room. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5376.0s)]
*  This is how fucking dumb we've gotten. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5381.0s)]
*  Find that. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5383.0s)]
*  Find this because basically barely getting the sentence out anyway. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5384.0s)]
*  Biden claims hidden airline feeds fees disproportionately affect people of color. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5387.0s)]
*  First of all, he's trying to say that airline seats. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5392.0s)]
*  Listen, folks, these are junk fees. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5397.0s)]
*  They're unfair and they hit marginalized Americans the hardest, especially low income folks and people of color. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5400.0s)]
*  First of all, and people of color. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5407.0s)]
*  What about rich people that go to the fucking first class? [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5410.0s)]
*  Go to the fucking first class in the airport. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5413.0s)]
*  A lot of people of color. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5415.0s)]
*  People of color kicking ass. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5417.0s)]
*  This is a guy who hasn't been in first class in a long time. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5418.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's been flying around in Air Force One for as long as he can remember. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5421.0s)]
*  His memory is good for three weeks. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5424.0s)]
*  Does it scroll down again a little further? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5427.0s)]
*  Other tweets about other stuff he said. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5429.0s)]
*  Poor kids such as poor kids are just as talented as smart and white kids. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5431.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5435.0s)]
*  An actual Joe Biden quote. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5437.0s)]
*  It's actually it's weird because we're you know, the midterms are right. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5439.0s)]
*  This is I've been tuning out, but I couldn't even the debate the other night. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5443.0s)]
*  Everybody was talking about the Federman Oz debate and I couldn't even watch it. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5448.0s)]
*  I was like, everyone's like, you've got to tune in. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5452.0s)]
*  I'm like, this is hard to find. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5454.0s)]
*  Really? Yes. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5456.0s)]
*  I'm like, this feels removed. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5457.0s)]
*  There was a make sure this is correct because there is a Duncan was telling me that there's a Reddit conspiracy. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5459.0s)]
*  He was talking about how places have taken down the debate. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5466.0s)]
*  You can't actually watch it with your own eyes. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5469.0s)]
*  And this is a thing that's happening. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5471.0s)]
*  And one of the things that people are criticizing is apparently Gmail. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5474.0s)]
*  This is an issue that Republicans when they're sending out like emails to get people to vote and for mailing lists, their mails have gone into spam filters. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5478.0s)]
*  Oh, weird. Yeah. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5490.0s)]
*  Here, I'll find I'll find this. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5492.0s)]
*  So we we deal with that. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5493.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. I hate to be like a conspiracy theorist, but with dumpster fire on on YouTube is a good example. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5495.0s)]
*  We were like doing look, our views weren't huge. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5502.0s)]
*  We were getting like 30 to 40 thousand regularly. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5505.0s)]
*  And then we started talking about certain issues like Leah Thomas. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5507.0s)]
*  Yeah. And suddenly our stuff just dropped off. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5512.0s)]
*  And you're I know that we're not like maybe people don't like us and we lost some audience. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5516.0s)]
*  But 40 percent of our audience? [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5522.0s)]
*  No, you're 100 percent. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5524.0s)]
*  They they punish you with the algorithm. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5526.0s)]

*  This is you know, the Gmail or G Drive, Google Drive. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5545.0s)]
*  If you try to put up the Kanye episode of Drink Champs, you know that they had a podcast and this was the original podcast that got Kanye in trouble. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5550.0s)]
*  If someone uploaded that to Google Drive and they deleted it. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5560.0s)]

*  Yeah, but no, it's it's in a lot of places like people have tried it. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5586.0s)]
*  Your file may violate Google Drive's terms of service. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5590.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. Because in that conversation, he said what things that they consider to be anti-Semitic. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5593.0s)]
*  So did you see that article that was going around and it was a big long thread on Twitter and a guy had to post he had to send his pediatrician a photo of his son's genitalia because he had a rash. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5598.0s)]

*  It's this is a wild story. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5651.0s)]
*  They have an automated tool to detect the use of images of children, but the system can get it wrong and the consequences are serious. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5654.0s)]
*  What if you shave your junk and you have a little penis and you send it to your girlfriend? [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5660.0s)]

*  Of course, I don't want child pornography out there. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5675.0s)]
*  So so I understand that they're trying to take measures because this is a problem that is now been assisted by technology. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5677.0s)]
*  But find out about the phone thing because Google that they shut down his phone because I was actually very interested in this new pixel. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5687.0s)]

*  There's pros and cons to data collecting. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5730.0s)]
*  The pros are that when they data collect they can find things that you're actually interested in send those things your way. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5733.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5740.0s)]

*  And they still won't give him all of his images back. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5750.0s)]
*  Not only did he lose emails contact information for friends and former colleagues and documentation of his son's first years of life but his Google Fi account shut down meaning he had to get a new phone number with another carrier without access to his old phone number and email address. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5752.0s)]
*  He couldn't get the security codes he needed to sign into other Internet accounts locking him out of much of his digital life. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5768.0s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5775.0s)]
*  And I think in the story and I'm not going to remember the order of operations but they he found out that he had been flagged for this because it automatically got sent to the police and the police luckily determined that it was not what Google flagged it as. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5776.0s)]
*  Scroll back up to the top please. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5794.0s)]
*  To the very top of the I wanted to read that when they were describing what he does go back up to the very top the very top very top of the article. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5796.0s)]
*  So when the photo of him where it says who he is and what he does is stay at home dad. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5807.0s)]
*  Stop stop stop stay at home dad in San Francisco. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5814.0s)]
*  He grabbed his Android smartphone took photos to document the problem. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5817.0s)]
*  This is his wife grabbed her husband's phone and texted a few high quality close ups of her son's growing area to her iPhone so that she could upload to that. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5823.0s)]
*  So he has a Google phone. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5830.0s)]
*  The wife has an iPhone. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5832.0s)]
*  How are they even together. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5834.0s)]
*  Scroll down. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5835.0s)]
*  Does it say what he does is this gentleman does. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5839.0s)]
*  He was an audio engineer of some kind. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5841.0s)]
*  Yeah that's. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5843.0s)]
*  There's. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5844.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5845.0s)]
*  Mark had worked as a software engineer at a large technology company's automatic tool automated tool for taking down video content flagged by users as problematic. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5846.0s)]
*  He knew such systems often have a human in the loop to ensure that the computers don't make a mistake and he assumed his case would be cleared up as soon as it reached that person. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5855.0s)]
*  So yeah two days after taking the pictures it said he he. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5864.0s)]
*  He got a blooping notification noise his account had been disabled because of harmful content that was a severe violation of Google's policies and might be illegal. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5869.0s)]
*  That is crazy that they fucking shut down his phone. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5879.0s)]
*  But I think I might be mistaken. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5882.0s)]
*  I don't want to. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5884.0s)]
*  I've read this story so many times but again my brain and I believe he found out about it because of that blue. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5885.0s)]
*  But then the police got involved and he was cleared but he still can't even get his stuff back. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5890.0s)]
*  And it's like all the pictures of his. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5896.0s)]
*  I just had a kid I'd be devastated if I lost all the. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5897.0s)]
*  Maybe they can give it back to him. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5900.0s)]
*  The more eggs you have in one basket the more likely is the basket is to break. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5901.0s)]
*  A few days after Mark filed the appeal Google responded that it would not reinstate the account with no further explanation. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5905.0s)]
*  Because they know it but Google Mark didn't know it but Google's review team had also flagged a video he made and the San Francisco Police Department had already started to investigate him. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5914.0s)]
*  So he actually is hoping that he can get his stuff back from the police because they have a drive. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5925.0s)]
*  This is the other fucked up thing. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5930.0s)]
*  They got a drive of everything that he had. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5932.0s)]
*  Every text message every photo every single thing his whole digital life was given to the police. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5936.0s)]
*  Yeah it's fucking crazy. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5944.0s)]
*  He was the middle of buying a house and signing countless digital documents when his Gmail account was disabled. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5946.0s)]
*  He asked his mortgage broker to switch his email address which made the broker suspicious until his real estate agent vouched for him. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5952.0s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5959.0s)]
*  Yeah this is a wild article. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5963.0s)]
*  Turn me off to getting a fucking Google phone Brian Simpson. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5965.0s)]
*  I mean I'm sure Apple can do it too. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5969.0s)]
*  But they don't. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5971.0s)]
*  They don't do that. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5972.0s)]
*  I've never heard that. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5973.0s)]
*  Not yet. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5974.0s)]
*  I mean yeah no. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5975.0s)]
*  I think Apple's a little better with that stuff. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5976.0s)]
*  Yeah it was that that story was wild. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5979.0s)]
*  And again it's I mean I think they would be like well you have to break a few eggs or whatever that expression is in order to catch some predators. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5981.0s)]
*  But there's there needs to be a way for people to get all their stuff back if they've been cleared. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5989.0s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5995.0s)]
*  And it's it's chilling and terrifying how much power they actually have. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=5997.0s)]
*  His Internet searches his location history his messages and any document photo and video he'd stored with the company. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6002.0s)]
*  What does this say. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6009.0s)]
*  It's all given to the police department. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6010.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6012.0s)]
*  And contain a letter informing him that been investigated as well as copies of the search warrants served on Google and his Internet service provider. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6013.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6020.0s)]
*  His Internet search history everything. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6021.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6024.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6025.0s)]
*  I determined that the incident did not meet the elements of a crime and no crime occurred. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6026.0s)]
*  Mr. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6033.0s)]
*  Hillard wrote in his report the police had access to the information Google had on Mark and decided did not constitute child abuse or expectation. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6034.0s)]
*  Of course it didn't. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6041.0s)]
*  You have to talk to Google Mr. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6042.0s)]
*  Hillard said according to Mark. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6044.0s)]
*  Mark appealed his case to Google again providing the police report but to no avail. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6045.0s)]
*  After getting a notice two months ago that his account was being permanently deleted. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6049.0s)]
*  Mark spoke with a lawyer about suing Google and how much it would cost. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6053.0s)]
*  I cited it was probably not worth the seven thousand dollars. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6058.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6061.0s)]
*  Yeah it's crazy. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6062.0s)]
*  Kate Klonick a law professor at St. John's University who's written about online content moderation said it can be challenging to account for things that are invisible in a photo like the behavior of the people sharing the image or the intentions of the person taking it. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6063.0s)]
*  And while false positives where people are erroneously flagged are inevitable given the billions of images being scanned while most people would probably consider that trade off worthwhile giving the benefit of identifying abused children. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6078.0s)]
*  Ms. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6091.0s)]
*  Klonick said that companies need a robust process for clearing and reinstating innocent people who are mistakenly flagged. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6092.0s)]
*  Has this successfully saved abused children. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6098.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6103.0s)]
*  I believe it has. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6104.0s)]
*  I mean I would hope so. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6105.0s)]
*  I hope so too because if it's like getting people in trouble. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6108.0s)]
*  What are the other options other than like Google Photos if you have say an Android phone. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6110.0s)]
*  What are the options other than. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6115.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6118.0s)]
*  If Google Photos is like checking for child porn on all your photos. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6119.0s)]
*  Is Apple doing that too. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6122.0s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6125.0s)]
*  But find out if Apple does something similar. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6126.0s)]
*  I'm sure they have to. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6128.0s)]
*  They have to probably right. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6129.0s)]
*  That's the thing these companies all have so much. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6131.0s)]
*  They I don't did they know they were going to have this much power and just or is it something that they just didn't account for. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6134.0s)]
*  Apple will scan US iPhones for images of child sexual abuse. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6141.0s)]
*  This is from August of 2021. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6145.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6147.0s)]
*  But then what I wonder is how can they just send every all of your information. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6148.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6152.0s)]
*  That is not a violation of your rights. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6153.0s)]
*  It should be. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6155.0s)]
*  And he probably does have a case. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6156.0s)]
*  I hope people are reaching out to him because you know if it's not worth seven thousand dollars to him maybe someone will take it on pro bono because that's a fucked up situation. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6158.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6167.0s)]
*  For that guy. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6168.0s)]
*  And look at looks and especially people that are hearing this. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6169.0s)]
*  This is going to steer people away from using an Android phone. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6171.0s)]
*  Apple holds off on plans to scan for child. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6174.0s)]
*  Yeah I remember Apple had been going back and forth on it. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6177.0s)]
*  I didn't know where they land. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6182.0s)]
*  This is in December of 2021. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6183.0s)]
*  Apple has implemented two new child safety features. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6186.0s)]
*  However the most controversial one is missing. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6188.0s)]
*  So that's the one where they scan off. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6191.0s)]
*  Well they probably reasonably assume that some people do take photos of their kids when they're naked. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6193.0s)]
*  So one of the videos that when they said there was another video that was flagged he said it was a video he probably took of his wife like breastfeeding his son. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6198.0s)]
*  You know and she was probably topless and like topless photos though. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6208.0s)]
*  That is fucking bananas. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6213.0s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6214.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6215.0s)]
*  It's just breastfeeding. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6216.0s)]
*  He's like that's all I can think of is it was probably just an intimate moment where my wife was lying in bed with my son and I wanted to capture it. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6217.0s)]
*  I mean I that's that's like how the fuck. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6224.0s)]
*  I get that they have a big net right. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6229.0s)]
*  I get it. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6232.0s)]
*  Google flag parents photos of sick children as sexual abuse and at least two cases Google has shut down accounts over pictures of kids containing nudity requested by pediatricians for [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6233.0s)]
*  diagnosing illnesses. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6244.0s)]
*  Yeah I would. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6246.0s)]
*  That's a good question though Jamie. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6247.0s)]
*  I would like to know like how how successful this is. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6248.0s)]
*  You know how many I'm all for catching predators and pedophiles but you have to have someone who would clearly look at that and go oh I see right. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6253.0s)]
*  Your kid has an issue right. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6262.0s)]
*  You sent a photo to a pediatrician the pediatrician checks out. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6264.0s)]
*  We looked at you know the rest of your account. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6267.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6269.0s)]
*  Yeah good. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6270.0s)]
*  Well definitely fucks you up because then they get to look at all your photos. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6271.0s)]
*  I know what if some of them are your car and you're sending them to your wife. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6274.0s)]
*  Is that like are you an abuser. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6278.0s)]
*  Are you a bad person. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6281.0s)]
*  That's what I don't understand is how the scope you know how how they're able to just send the drive with everything. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6282.0s)]
*  How that scope how that is somehow it seems like it should be a violation of like search and seizure. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6289.0s)]
*  I don't I don't know. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6296.0s)]
*  Well this is not a gene. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6297.0s)]
*  This is the argument for platforms like Signal where Signal is it's a messaging platform where it's encrypted. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6299.0s)]
*  I think that's what's out. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6309.0s)]
*  They have to be. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6313.0s)]
*  They have to have something like that. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6314.0s)]
*  Look I'm not under the illusion. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6316.0s)]
*  You know I had Gavin De Becker on who is a security expert who explained to me that the original Pegasus that was invented by I think was the massage. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6318.0s)]
*  The Israeli government invented some or someone and invented this original way of scanning your phone. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6327.0s)]
*  So what it would be was this is how Jeff Bezos like the Saudis got a hold of. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6337.0s)]
*  They hacked. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6343.0s)]
*  He was doing something with them and they sent him. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6344.0s)]
*  Yeah eventually. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6347.0s)]
*  But they sent him a WhatsApp link. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6348.0s)]
*  He clicks on the WhatsApp link and it uploads this Pegasus program to his phone. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6350.0s)]
*  And then because of that they got access access to all of his stuff. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6355.0s)]
*  And I think the story goes I don't want to fuck this up but I think the story goes that Jeff Bezos is bombshell girlfriend. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6359.0s)]
*  Yeah her brother kind of scumbag. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6367.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6371.0s)]
*  And Bezos is now suing the brother. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6372.0s)]
*  Make sure that's true. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6374.0s)]
*  Is he the brother got access to that to those things because of this. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6375.0s)]
*  And then he sold them to tabloids. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6380.0s)]
*  How did his brother get access to it. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6383.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6385.0s)]
*  Maybe the sister just left the phone laying around. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6386.0s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6388.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6389.0s)]
*  That's how all this is kind of connected to this thing called Pegasus. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6390.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6394.0s)]
*  And what Pegasus is a spyware that allows people to look in your phone. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6395.0s)]
*  That's Pegasus one. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6398.0s)]
*  He said Pegasus two the newest best version. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6399.0s)]
*  All they needed your phone number. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6402.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6403.0s)]
*  So everything you say online everything you say to your friends everything you say is capable of being monitored. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6404.0s)]
*  There there literally are no secrets anymore. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6411.0s)]
*  The best thing about something like Signal is Signal has an auto delete function. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6413.0s)]
*  So you could say I send you a message. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6419.0s)]
*  So go fuck yourself Bridget. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6420.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6421.0s)]
*  And that message goes away in five minutes. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6422.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6424.0s)]
*  If I decide to do it that way. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6425.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6426.0s)]
*  I mean but people can still screenshot right. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6427.0s)]
*  They can screenshot. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6429.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6430.0s)]
*  But it doesn't have like you don't have a digital record of it the way you have with text messages or. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6431.0s)]
*  But I'm sure they could go back and find it right. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6436.0s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6439.0s)]
*  But I think the thing is with this Pegasus thing is they have access to your phone. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6440.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6445.0s)]
*  Like not just every email you send every search every wherever you're going with maps you know every time you go to a location like your phone knows where home is. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6446.0s)]
*  You ever notice that. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6457.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6458.0s)]
*  Like oh do you want to go home with the man. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6459.0s)]
*  I didn't know where I had been trying to tell you. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6460.0s)]
*  It just knows that's where you go every night. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6462.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6464.0s)]
*  I mean that was why I was laughing when everybody was like oh the tracking devices and there are all those memes going around. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6465.0s)]
*  It's like you know they don't need a tracking device in the vaccines like you have a phone. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6471.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6477.0s)]
*  Well that is just they thought there was magnets in there and all sorts of wild shit. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6478.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6482.0s)]
*  Gone. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6484.0s)]
*  No it's just it's it's the weird trade off of this digital life that we live. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6485.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6489.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6490.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6491.0s)]
*  I wonder too if that's why the younger generation doesn't have the same. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6492.0s)]
*  They're like what's privacy. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6496.0s)]
*  You know they don't give a fuck. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6497.0s)]
*  They don't. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6498.0s)]
*  Yeah they don't. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6499.0s)]
*  They know that it doesn't really exist. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6500.0s)]
*  My friend Cameron Haynes his son is on the tick tock and he's addicted to tick tock and I was explaining to them about the privacy violations and all the same. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6502.0s)]
*  He's like yeah but tick tock's awesome. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6510.0s)]
*  I'm not deleting it. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6512.0s)]
*  He's laughing. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6513.0s)]
*  But he also doesn't have anything to hide in his mind. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6514.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6517.0s)]
*  He's 25 and doesn't give a fuck. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6518.0s)]
*  Yeah but you don't have anything to hide. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6520.0s)]
*  But that's like well if you don't have anything to hide why are you afraid they're going to search your house. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6522.0s)]
*  You don't have anything to hide until suddenly something is like all the rules change so quickly now. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6527.0s)]
*  What is allowed and what isn't allowed and it does seem there is a very I don't know I feel I feel more optimistic lately because I do think people I saw a lot of people move with their feet during the pandemic. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6535.0s)]
*  Did you see the New York City is reinstating a story that's getting zero press by the way. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6549.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6555.0s)]
*  Say that story. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6556.0s)]
*  Tell the story. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6557.0s)]
*  The New York I think New York City's being forced to reinstate all the was it the city employees who were fired for refusing to take the vaccine. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6558.0s)]
*  Yeah. And with back pay. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6569.0s)]
*  With back pay. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6570.0s)]
*  They have to pay them back pay. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6571.0s)]
*  So all the cops that got fired all the frontline workers. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6572.0s)]
*  Yep. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6575.0s)]
*  Which is great. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6576.0s)]
*  Which is great. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6577.0s)]
*  Because the thing they said is it doesn't prevent transmission and it doesn't prevent infection which is true. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6578.0s)]
*  Yeah. And this is a thing that people were worried about from the very beginning. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6584.0s)]
*  You remember when they were saying that breakthrough and very rare breakthrough infections breakthrough infections. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6586.0s)]
*  It's all horse shit. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6591.0s)]
*  And then did you see where the Pfizer that woman from Pfizer in the EU she was testifying and she had to say that they never tested it. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6592.0s)]
*  Oh yeah I saw that. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6601.0s)]
*  They never tested it to see if it prevented infections. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6603.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6607.0s)]
*  They had no data and they were just saying it openly. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6608.0s)]
*  The vaccine prevents infection. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6610.0s)]
*  They had no data that showed that the New York that that was made me optimistic seeing that because it's such it is such garbage like the Djokovic can come in and play tennis. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6613.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6624.0s)]
*  Like how how you know people are still getting this when they're vaccinated. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6625.0s)]
*  Not only that he's had covid twice. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6628.0s)]
*  This is nonsensical. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6630.0s)]
*  It doesn't even I don't even care how many times he's had covid. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6631.0s)]
*  This is just bullshit at this point because we know this and I don't know this like allergy to science that has taken. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6634.0s)]
*  It's not an allergy to science. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6643.0s)]
*  It's an allergy to people that oppose a specific ideology. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6644.0s)]
*  Like that's why I say about masks like masks. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6647.0s)]
*  I don't even think these people think mass prevent covid. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6650.0s)]
*  It's a way of letting people know that you're a leftist like masks are the Democrats. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6652.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6659.0s)]
*  It's letting people know I'm keeping everyone safe. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6661.0s)]
*  I've had 18 boosters and I still wear a mask. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6664.0s)]
*  I mean you want to talk about privilege though. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6667.0s)]
*  This is people who are allowed to stay home in their bubble and never leave who are saying this stuff because if you were just like a working class person you were working through the whole pandemic. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6669.0s)]
*  When we went to see Roger Waters we all had to wear masks. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6680.0s)]
*  When we went backstage we all had to wear masks. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6683.0s)]
*  Everyone had masks on everyone and I asked one of the guys working there. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6686.0s)]
*  What is this because it's wild. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6690.0s)]
*  I've never seen this before. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6692.0s)]
*  Not recently. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6693.0s)]
*  And he said it is everyone's way of letting everyone know that they're leftists. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6694.0s)]
*  This is a guy who worked there. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6699.0s)]
*  He goes this is he goes this is what it is. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6700.0s)]
*  He goes just and so me and Tony you know I went with Hinchcliffe. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6703.0s)]
*  I was like put your mask on Tony. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6706.0s)]
*  Put your mask. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6708.0s)]
*  I put my mask on. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6709.0s)]
*  You should have a fucking mask on and we were just the option to not wear it. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6710.0s)]
*  No you had to wear it. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6714.0s)]
*  Oh weird. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6715.0s)]
*  Well we were hanging around with Roger. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6716.0s)]
*  The idea was that Roger can't afford to get sick because Roger's older. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6717.0s)]
*  But meanwhile I was getting drunk with Roger afterwards. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6721.0s)]
*  I wasn't getting drunk because it's sober October but Roger's doing shots of tequila. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6724.0s)]
*  We're all hanging out. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6728.0s)]
*  There's photos of us all maskless hanging out with Roger after the concert. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6729.0s)]
*  We're all sitting around the table. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6734.0s)]
*  There's Ari and Tony and Duncan and we're having a great time just chit chatting having a blast. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6735.0s)]
*  But meanwhile fucking 20 minutes ago we had to wear a mask. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6741.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6744.0s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6745.0s)]
*  It's I don't. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6746.0s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6747.0s)]
*  No. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6748.0s)]
*  No. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6749.0s)]
*  And all through I think like all of this another thing that gives makes me optimistic is suddenly [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6750.0s)]
*  CNN the other day was like how come we're not talking about the children who suffered [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6755.0s)]
*  during the pandemic. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6761.0s)]
*  It's like no shit. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6762.0s)]
*  We were screaming about this during the pandemic. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6764.0s)]
*  I was like this was one of the things that like broke broke me. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6766.0s)]
*  Just made my blood boil was the people who suffered the most that were the people that [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6770.0s)]
*  they said they cared about. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6775.0s)]
*  Like you think that these who's going to suffer when the parks are closed who's going to suffer [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6777.0s)]
*  when it's the kids who can't log in and the kids who can't who live in places where they [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6783.0s)]
*  need public parks not kids with like backyards and a device. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6789.0s)]
*  Well how about the fucking developmental issues. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6792.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6795.0s)]
*  That's all my friends and family. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6796.0s)]
*  My friends and family who work in child care are like everybody's behind. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6799.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6803.0s)]
*  Kids are all behind in learning how to talk. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6804.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6806.0s)]
*  Yep. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6807.0s)]
*  Learning how to read people's facial expressions. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6808.0s)]
*  It's a key developmental period of these children's lives. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6811.0s)]
*  So children that were like two and one and three years old like little kids are learning [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6815.0s)]
*  from people's expressions and how they talk. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6821.0s)]
*  Now the sudden everyone's got like a block over that. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6823.0s)]
*  And so it stunts their development. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6826.0s)]
*  But this is what makes me so mad at progressives and people who are saying like we need to [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6828.0s)]
*  like shut the schools. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6832.0s)]
*  And in L.A. I think we had maybe the longest shutdowns and they're like that's that's just [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6833.0s)]
*  them protecting everybody else. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6839.0s)]
*  But these kids are behind and there's already they do lots of studies about like like [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6841.0s)]
*  marginalized communities and the summer gap because a lot of kids fall behind over the [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6847.0s)]
*  summer. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6851.0s)]
*  And this was like a very extended two year summer gap for a lot of the people that allegedly [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6852.0s)]
*  all of these people you know care about. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6858.0s)]
*  But I'm like if you cared you would you would have these kids back in school. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6861.0s)]
*  They don't get that sick. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6866.0s)]
*  Well they didn't adjust right when they learned that it wasn't scary for everybody that the [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6867.0s)]
*  real people that were being affected by this in a dangerous way were old people and overweight [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6873.0s)]
*  people and people with compromised immune systems. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6877.0s)]
*  They didn't adjust for that. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6880.0s)]
*  And we knew they didn't adjust for that. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6881.0s)]
*  And they were just telling you you have to do what we say. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6883.0s)]
*  And that's where it got bad for people. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6886.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6888.0s)]
*  What are you talking about especially people that had covid and got over it. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6889.0s)]
*  They're like hey what are you saying because this I had it. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6892.0s)]
*  I know what it is. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6896.0s)]
*  And if you're healthy and if you take care of yourself it's not as bad as if you're not [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6897.0s)]
*  healthy and not taking care of yourself but you're not saying that. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6902.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6905.0s)]
*  You're not. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6906.0s)]
*  So you're not providing all the data. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6907.0s)]
*  All you're doing is acting as propagandist for the pharmaceutical companies that are [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6908.0s)]
*  pushing this one binary solution. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6912.0s)]
*  You have to do this. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6914.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6915.0s)]
*  People telling me after I survived from covid survived. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6916.0s)]
*  I'm a covid survivor. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6919.0s)]
*  After I was sick for a day. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6921.0s)]
*  After I was sick people were telling me you should get vaccinated now. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6923.0s)]
*  I'm like what are you talking about. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6925.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you saying. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6927.0s)]
*  That's who we're getting sick at. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6928.0s)]
*  Sanjay Gupta was saying this to me when I had Sanjay Gupta on. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6929.0s)]
*  I was like you know that getting over the disease provides a better protection seven [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6933.0s)]
*  times better. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6940.0s)]
*  This is science. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6941.0s)]
*  So what are you saying. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6942.0s)]
*  Well it's even more protection if you get vaccinated. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6943.0s)]
*  Even more. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6946.0s)]
*  Even more. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6948.0s)]
*  No. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6949.0s)]
*  So what I get over it in six hours instead of 24. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6950.0s)]
*  Like what the fuck are you saying. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6953.0s)]
*  And it's not protecting other people. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6955.0s)]
*  It's not. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6957.0s)]
*  It's not protecting people from transmission. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6958.0s)]
*  It's not protecting people from infection. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6960.0s)]
*  And selling that idea to people is dangerous because now you have people thinking I got [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6962.0s)]
*  the vaccine and I'm not going to spread it and they're spreading it. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6966.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6969.0s)]
*  And they thought they were doing the right thing. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6970.0s)]
*  So they think everybody should do the thing that they did. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6972.0s)]
*  Which makes sense. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6975.0s)]
*  It's logical. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6976.0s)]
*  It's logical that if you think you did the right thing and you went and got vaccinated [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6977.0s)]
*  you're mad that other people didn't. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6981.0s)]
*  But then once you've gotten all the data and as time goes on we're going to get even more [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6982.0s)]
*  data. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6987.0s)]
*  More and more and more over time. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6988.0s)]
*  And we're going to recognize what these fucking problems really are. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6990.0s)]
*  You've got to adjust to the new data. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6993.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6995.0s)]
*  And people don't want to do that because they had these initial positions they took. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=6996.0s)]
*  They dug their heels into the sand and they pointed fingers at everybody who didn't do [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7000.0s)]
*  what they were supposed to do. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7004.0s)]
*  And they didn't take into consideration that throughout history pharmaceutical companies [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7005.0s)]
*  have been full of shit. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7010.0s)]
*  And they are. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7011.0s)]
*  We all know this. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7012.0s)]
*  We all know this. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7013.0s)]
*  And I don't want to shit on like I do want to shit on them but they've done a lot of [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7014.0s)]
*  good things. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7018.0s)]
*  You know there's a lot of medicine. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7019.0s)]
*  A lot of great medicine. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7020.0s)]
*  There's a lot of great technology. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7021.0s)]
*  People's lives have been saved. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7022.0s)]
*  But this is a this we don't trust them. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7024.0s)]
*  We shouldn't. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7027.0s)]
*  They're corporations that are only trying to make money. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7028.0s)]
*  That all that stuff too that came out about like the serotonin and antidepressants and [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7031.0s)]
*  how there was like no real link between. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7035.0s)]
*  No real evidence that it's a chemical imbalance. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7038.0s)]
*  None. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7041.0s)]
*  Like the thing they've sold us on antidepressants for decades. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7042.0s)]
*  Decades. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7046.0s)]
*  Decades. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7047.0s)]
*  And everyone's like you're chemically imbalanced. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7048.0s)]
*  Actually there's no evidence you're chemically imbalanced. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7051.0s)]
*  And there's also some evidence that they're not as effective as regular exercise and community [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7053.0s)]
*  and happiness and loved ones and purpose. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7059.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7061.0s)]
*  No I mean this and I think another thing that made me optimistic I'm trying to think of [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7062.0s)]
*  things that make me optimistic. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7067.0s)]
*  Like the NHS coming pulling back from the gender affirming care model. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7069.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7074.0s)]
*  That was pretty recent. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7075.0s)]
*  And saying like oh science is not actually backing up that this is the correct way to [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7076.0s)]
*  deal with gender dysphoria in minors in particular. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7082.0s)]
*  Well they're also faced with the real consequences of taking these hormone blockers. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7086.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7091.0s)]
*  They're shown all these health risks that are happening all these different things that [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7092.0s)]
*  are happening to kids. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7096.0s)]
*  So these studies are coming out about these hormone blockers because the narrative was [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7097.0s)]
*  always you could pause. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7101.0s)]
*  Pause it. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7102.0s)]
*  Pause it. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7103.0s)]
*  And it doesn't affect you at all. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7104.0s)]
*  Like you don't know. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7106.0s)]
*  First of all this is not something you need long term data on these things to really understand. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7107.0s)]
*  Your brain is insane when you're going through puberty and you're going to add you're going [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7111.0s)]
*  to just stop that or add testosterone or something. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7116.0s)]
*  How can you just fucking chill out. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7120.0s)]
*  Can you just wait until. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7123.0s)]
*  Well it's also like why do you need if someone is they feel like they're in the wrong gender. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7125.0s)]
*  They feel like they should be a woman or they should be a man. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7132.0s)]
*  If you feel like you identify with a woman you want to identify as a woman. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7135.0s)]
*  Why do you have to add stuff to your body that you don't even know what the effect is [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7139.0s)]
*  going to be. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7143.0s)]
*  If you you know I'm saying like that's this you're talking about a different thing like [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7144.0s)]
*  if you identify as a woman and you feel like you're a woman just be a woman. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7148.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7153.0s)]
*  Decide you're a woman. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7154.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7155.0s)]
*  I'm cool with that. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7156.0s)]
*  And if you want as a grown adult to try to take hormones to accentuate that or to give [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7157.0s)]
*  you a better feeling of what it means to be a woman like a woman should have estrogen [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7163.0s)]
*  I want to take estrogen. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7169.0s)]
*  That's your right. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7170.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7171.0s)]
*  You should be able to do that. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7172.0s)]
*  But to impose that on kids when you don't necessarily know. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7173.0s)]
*  And I feel so bad for these parents because their kids are in crisis often. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7177.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7181.0s)]
*  And they're getting bad advice. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7182.0s)]
*  You know they're they're they have they're going to professionals and they're saying [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7184.0s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7187.0s)]
*  And they're like well let's just go with what the kid wants. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7188.0s)]
*  And I think we should you know write them a prescription. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7191.0s)]
*  And I know people say it's not that quick but there's tons. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7194.0s)]
*  It is that quick. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7197.0s)]
*  It is. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7198.0s)]
*  I've had D transitioners on my podcast on Walk-Ins Welcome and their stories are so [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7199.0s)]
*  important and they all say there was barely more than like one or two interviews with [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7204.0s)]
*  you know going wherever they went to get their to get started on hormone blockers or [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7211.0s)]
*  started on testosterone or whatever. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7215.0s)]
*  And even one young woman who came on she was saying that she was old enough legally to [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7218.0s)]
*  make the decision but she was still only 20. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7225.0s)]
*  And I'm like it's still you know she's like I want to take responsibility. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7227.0s)]
*  I made this choice but I'm like you're not even your prefrontal cortex isn't even [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7232.0s)]
*  developed until you're like 25. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7237.0s)]
*  You can't know. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7239.0s)]
*  And like I've like I've been saying too about one of the things I've been kind of [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7240.0s)]
*  radicalized about since I had a kid is in particular with all of these young people [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7244.0s)]
*  who are being pushed to essentially become sterile in many many cases when you start [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7250.0s)]
*  taking the blockers and start going down that road is it's not informed consent because [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7256.0s)]
*  you can't know until you know. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7262.0s)]
*  Well you're a baby. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7264.0s)]
*  This is something you can't know until you know. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7265.0s)]
*  I didn't even know I wanted kids or thought I wanted kids until I was like in my 30s. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7267.0s)]
*  You know in my 20s I probably would have been like yeah whatever. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7272.0s)]
*  You eat my teats. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7275.0s)]
*  If I was you eat my teeth. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7276.0s)]
*  That's what they call it. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7278.0s)]
*  They call it. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7280.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7281.0s)]
*  There's it's like that slang. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7282.0s)]
*  Well there's also a thing that happens when you take testosterone you have this euphoria [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7283.0s)]
*  like you feel it alleviates anxiety in many people. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7287.0s)]
*  It gives you a different feeling. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7290.0s)]
*  Yeah testosterone is awesome. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7292.0s)]
*  And they decide like oh this is what I've been missing. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7294.0s)]
*  This is this is the real me. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7297.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7299.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7300.0s)]
*  But then there's no and they're sold a lie that you can pause and go back and you can't [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7301.0s)]
*  go back. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7305.0s)]
*  It's it's. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7306.0s)]
*  How did this happen. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7307.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7308.0s)]
*  And I don't what I don't understand is how in Europe where they were kind of trailblazing [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7309.0s)]
*  in a lot of this they're looking at the science and backing off and saying we need to put on [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7314.0s)]
*  the brakes not not push this on young children and pump the brakes and stop you know trying [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7320.0s)]
*  to get minor. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7329.0s)]
*  It's like crazy but at least they're looking at the science and saying there's not real [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7330.0s)]
*  enough evidence to suggest that there's less suicide if you start the gender affirming [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7335.0s)]
*  care model versus wait and see which was the old model. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7340.0s)]
*  And now in the United States it feels like just fucking put on the put the foot on the [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7344.0s)]
*  accelerator and go. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7352.0s)]
*  Do you think that's because in the United States the pharmaceutical industry has far [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7353.0s)]
*  more influence on on people and society and the way things are done. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7357.0s)]
*  I mean I don't know. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7363.0s)]
*  I think there's definitely like a social contagion element to it. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7364.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7368.0s)]
*  So there's that. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7369.0s)]
*  If you have like a movement that's happening from the youth then and it's every everywhere [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7370.0s)]
*  even though they want to say that it's not a social contagion which I'm like this. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7376.0s)]
*  How can you be a person who's like my age and say this isn't a social contagion. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7380.0s)]
*  I'm like look at it happens in groups of friends like one 14 year old will identify as a day [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7385.0s)]
*  and then pretty soon all the in particular among girls then they'll all be identifying. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7393.0s)]
*  This is how can you look at that and be like this isn't a social contagion. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7398.0s)]
*  This has always been like this. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7401.0s)]
*  No it hasn't. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7402.0s)]
*  Well if you look at the number the uptick the uptick is wild. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7403.0s)]
*  What I don't understand is how it's been so and I just rack my brain and I try to be have [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7408.0s)]
*  good faith and I don't understand how it's been institutionalized. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7415.0s)]
*  That's what I you know even when I was in my like birthing class that I had to take online [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7419.0s)]
*  or it didn't have to but I took it online and they were referring to everybody's birthing persons [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7425.0s)]
*  through the whole thing and I wanted to fucking scream because it's like the A there was as far as I could tell [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7430.0s)]
*  from the zoom there just seemed to be a bunch of women and I'm like why can't you say women even if there's [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7438.0s)]
*  one person why can't they handle being called a woman like right. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7443.0s)]
*  Why do we have to cater to the one point zero one percent of the population with this language and all [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7448.0s)]
*  the language changes and I think like though they've changed it in you know like federal documents and [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7455.0s)]
*  I don't understand. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7462.0s)]
*  Here's a question and has this been sorted out. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7464.0s)]
*  You know as a person that has been pregnant has given birth there's a bunch of stuff you're not supposed to take [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7467.0s)]
*  while you're pregnant. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7474.0s)]
*  It's just like you're breastfeeding you said can I take these nutrients that help your memory I don't know I'll take it. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7475.0s)]
*  You got to be careful. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7480.0s)]
*  You got to be careful about what skin stuff you use. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7481.0s)]
*  What about testosterone. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7483.0s)]
*  What about testosterone. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7484.0s)]
*  Like when when you see these pregnant men. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7485.0s)]
*  Oh yeah I don't know. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7488.0s)]
*  What is how are they off of it. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7490.0s)]
*  Are they off of it. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7492.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7494.0s)]
*  I would hope so. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7495.0s)]
*  I would hope so. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7496.0s)]
*  Google do pregnant men take testosterone while they're pregnant. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7498.0s)]
*  Taking testosterone in pregnancy is not recommended. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7504.0s)]
*  Do not stop taking testosterone before talking with the doctor who is prescribing it for you. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7509.0s)]
*  If you stop taking testosterone you'll probably start to have periods. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7515.0s)]
*  You may also notice changes in your body shape around your hips chest and thighs. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7519.0s)]
*  Oh you become a woman again. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7523.0s)]
*  What the fuck. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7525.0s)]
*  What the fuck. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7527.0s)]
*  What does testosterone do to pregnant women. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7528.0s)]
*  Click on that. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7530.0s)]
*  Elevated maternal testosterone levels during human pregnancy are associated with growth restriction in utero. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7531.0s)]
*  Our results support animal studies which have indicated that maternal androgen levels influence. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7538.0s)]
*  How's that word. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7545.0s)]
*  Intrauterine. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7546.0s)]
*  Intrauterine offspring environment and development. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7547.0s)]
*  Right. Of course it does. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7552.0s)]
*  So what happens to those babies. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7554.0s)]
*  It sounds like from pregnant men. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7557.0s)]
*  It's associated with growth restriction. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7560.0s)]
*  There's a lot of women that push back on the idea of someone taking estrogen that's a biological male and becoming a female. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7562.0s)]
*  But very few men really give a shit about a trans man being called a man. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7571.0s)]
*  Have you noticed that. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7578.0s)]
*  There's not like we're fucking men. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7579.0s)]
*  That's not a man. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7581.0s)]
*  Elliot Page is not a man. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7582.0s)]
*  Men don't do that. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7585.0s)]
*  We don't care. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7586.0s)]
*  You know why. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7587.0s)]
*  Because it doesn't encroach into male spaces the way testosterone like a biological male that decides to become a female encroaches into female spaces and tends to use like male behavior. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7588.0s)]
*  And especially in sports like this male dominance of female places like Leah Thomas. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7605.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7612.0s)]
*  That's a classic example of a biological male dominating a female space. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7613.0s)]
*  But you don't see any of that. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7618.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7619.0s)]
*  So there's no threat. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7620.0s)]
*  So like a trans man someone who becomes a man they just like Buck Angel like hey all right you're a man like cool guy like I'll call you a man. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7621.0s)]
*  You seem cool. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7629.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7630.0s)]
*  I like him. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7631.0s)]
*  He's cool. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7632.0s)]
*  He's amazing. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7633.0s)]
*  But nobody does no pushback zero pushback. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7634.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7636.0s)]
*  Because there's no advantage in a sense like they don't dominate male spaces like if all of a sudden a train like if there was some crazy benefit like a female a biological female who takes testosterone and then decides to become a trans man and identifies as a man but then just starts dominating male spaces men would be like who the fuck. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7637.0s)]
*  What the fuck. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7659.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7660.0s)]
*  I'm a real man. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7661.0s)]
*  I'm a fucking man man. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7662.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7663.0s)]
*  You're a man like men we get mad but there's zero pushback men don't like Elliot Page like there was a lot of people that were like ideologically opposed to it or didn't think it was right or thought it was a bad decision but that's on you. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7664.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7677.0s)]
*  No men push back against that. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7678.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7679.0s)]
*  That what I understand why women would push back though. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7680.0s)]
*  I mean you're I I'm I've been screaming women forever and you definitely our text group. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7682.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7688.0s)]
*  That's the name of our text group. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7689.0s)]
*  You see you see it like and there's a reason for female spaces I interviewed the couple of the women from the women's liberation front and they're they're suing some of the California corrections for allowing people to just self identify into female prisons with penises [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7691.0s)]
*  and getting women pregnant. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7712.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7714.0s)]
*  People who are known predators known predators been arrested as being predators. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7715.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7720.0s)]
*  Not just like I think that guy might be fucking not like oh he stole something from a convenience store and now he wants not even like he's a player like sexual predators being like I'm a girl now and then they go into a female prison and nobody. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7721.0s)]
*  Where are the women where are the feminists. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7736.0s)]
*  I don't understand where are the well they're afraid of being ostracized. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7739.0s)]
*  They're afraid of being attacked because it does happen. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7744.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7746.0s)]
*  You see it with so many of these women like J.K. Rowling or Megan or you know fill in the blank Abigail Shrier these women who come out and oppose this they get attacked. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7747.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7759.0s)]
*  But you don't see that from men like men don't seem to care at all about trans men becoming men. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7760.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7768.0s)]
*  Okay you're a man. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7769.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7770.0s)]
*  It's it's definitely getting aggressive to you know the the protesting they it's like trans women will show up and protest some of these feminists and they'll get aggressive and violent. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7771.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7785.0s)]
*  Male like masculine like men do. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7786.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7789.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7790.0s)]
*  Because they're biological males and biological males tend to approach situations in a different way. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7791.0s)]
*  We've seen that thing recently where I think it was at a Matt Walsh. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7796.0s)]
*  He was giving a speech and there was these women that were holding up these signs and this trans woman is standing in this lady's face fucking screaming at her like fuck you bitch and like there's one of them one of them is my favorite. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7801.0s)]
*  It was after Roe v Wade. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7816.0s)]
*  There was this trans woman who was protesting Roe v Wade. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7818.0s)]
*  Keep your laws out of my pussy. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7821.0s)]
*  What. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7824.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7825.0s)]
*  But they'll come after people like my friends who are feminists or me online if you're saying like oh if you're pushing for you know this is important about women and women's reproductive health and they'll be like you know it's not fair for you to leave us out of the conversation. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7826.0s)]
*  It's like bro. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7842.0s)]
*  I mean you can't reproduce. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7844.0s)]
*  But it's also just hijacking a whole movement and it's insane to me how quickly the conversation about all this like birthing persons a minute Roe v Wade stop like oh suddenly we're using women again. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7847.0s)]
*  We're because it matters. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7860.0s)]
*  Yeah, because it does matter. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7862.0s)]
*  It's so it's but I just the thing that is baffling to me and I cannot get my mind around it is just how it's been again captured institutionally. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7863.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7873.0s)]
*  All of these things I would be like oh we'll just outgrow this as a country. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7874.0s)]
*  But it's all it's institutionalized so much of this and then you see on like big tech where you get punished maybe silently or algorithm algorithmically. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7878.0s)]
*  Is that a word. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7891.0s)]
*  If you're even pushing back against it or questioning even have an opinion like Megan what she got banned from Twitter for was saying a man is never a woman. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7892.0s)]
*  That's it. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7901.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7902.0s)]
*  That's what she said. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7903.0s)]
*  She was arguing. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7904.0s)]
*  It was about I think it was about that case. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7905.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7907.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7908.0s)]
*  The guy who was a biological male was going with a penis fully functional. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7909.0s)]
*  That was the guy or the trans woman up in Canada who was like suing the people at the salon. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7913.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7920.0s)]
*  Shut down. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7921.0s)]
*  Not watching her balls her balls and dick. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7922.0s)]
*  This person went to different salons and was making them wax. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7925.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7930.0s)]
*  And they were like hey we're not here for dicks. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7931.0s)]
*  Like we only do vaginas. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7934.0s)]
*  But didn't it come out to that person as a predator. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7936.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7938.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7939.0s)]
*  Of course. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7940.0s)]
*  Of course. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7941.0s)]
*  And mentally ill. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7942.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7943.0s)]
*  One of my favorite ones is this is a trans woman with a beard and wearing a dress that said some women have penises and if you don't like that you could suck my dick. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7944.0s)]
*  That's what we joked about. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7952.0s)]
*  I'm freaking dumpster fire years ago is that we were so close to suck my dick. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7954.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7959.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7960.0s)]
*  And it's here. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7961.0s)]
*  It's here. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7962.0s)]
*  It's normalized and people say it and they'll put it in signs. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7963.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7965.0s)]
*  No. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7966.0s)]
*  It's fine if you want to go turf hunting. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7967.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7968.0s)]
*  You want to go. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7969.0s)]
*  Go out. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7970.0s)]
*  J.K. Rowling man. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7971.0s)]
*  I mean she's getting dragged through the fucking mud. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7972.0s)]
*  She is. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7974.0s)]
*  I mean she's so reasonable and people are like all she had to do was be quiet and all she had to do is enjoy her billions and it's like yeah. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7975.0s)]
*  And she's not. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7982.0s)]
*  She's fighting for women's bases. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7983.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7987.0s)]
*  She doesn't have to. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7988.0s)]
*  And she's fighting for these young girls who don't know any better. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7989.0s)]
*  She's fighting. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7993.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7994.0s)]
*  She didn't have to do that. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7995.0s)]
*  She could have. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7996.0s)]
*  She could have ignored all of this and just enjoyed her money and she's not. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=7997.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of the people that that jumped in on that pile on they're going to recognize years from now how fucked up that was. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8000.0s)]
*  I want people to I would like when people interview the I just want people on record saying that they're for this. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8008.0s)]
*  It's like OK. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8018.0s)]
*  You believe in gender affirming care. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8019.0s)]
*  Do you know what that means? [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8021.0s)]
*  That means puberty blockers. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8022.0s)]
*  That means giving kids different sex hormones. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8024.0s)]
*  That means like basically child mutilation. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8028.0s)]
*  You are on record saying that you are for this because I don't think it will stand the test of time. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8033.0s)]
*  It's castration of prepubescent males in many cases. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8040.0s)]
*  Oh God. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8043.0s)]
*  The stories I mean the stories are sad. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8044.0s)]
*  Those are some of the saddest. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8046.0s)]
*  It's and they're just it's so sad what happens to D transitioners who come out and push back and you get attacked. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8048.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8056.0s)]
*  You would think if you're comfortable in your movement and your choice like someone isn't if someone's like yeah I drink I'm not like you drink. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8057.0s)]
*  You must be a fucking alcoholic then because I quit drinking. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8064.0s)]
*  If you're comfortable in your choice you don't need to attack people for having a different opinion. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8068.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8073.0s)]
*  Or if someone does quit drinking and people say what are you a fucking pussy. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8074.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8077.0s)]
*  You can't handle the booze. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8078.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8079.0s)]
*  You're not one of us. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8080.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8082.0s)]
*  I just let people make their choices but I don't think with the with with I don't know it's like but it's just with children is not right. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8083.0s)]
*  It's wild how prevalent it is. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8092.0s)]
*  I know. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8093.0s)]
*  And about it's wild how this this logical perspective is shunned. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8094.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8099.0s)]
*  It's not shunned but silence. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8100.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8102.0s)]
*  You'll get attacked. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8103.0s)]
*  You know people are afraid to say this around their friend groups. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8104.0s)]
*  It's another way to kind of signal that you're part of the high status in group is to be like boys and girls aren't different. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8107.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8114.0s)]
*  It's like it's real strange. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8115.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8117.0s)]
*  It's real strange to just openly accept all this stuff without any pushback. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8118.0s)]
*  I think there will be pushback though. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8122.0s)]
*  Again I think we're seeing it in Europe and they were like leaders of this kind of movement and now it seems like they're coming to their senses a little bit and following science. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8124.0s)]
*  I don't necessarily see that although we might see it in the midterms. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8135.0s)]
*  You know like again people tend to voice their opinion on these things at the ballot when they don't have to voice their opinion. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8141.0s)]
*  And there are a lot of people that are afraid of talking about right. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8148.0s)]
*  But they're not afraid of voting about it right because there's a lot of people that are afraid of the reprisal. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8152.0s)]
*  They're afraid of getting attacked and they'll silently when they're amongst friends going what the fuck is going on. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8158.0s)]
*  Like what is going on. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8164.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8165.0s)]
*  And those people that's going to be responsible for the red wave. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8166.0s)]
*  I think the red wave that's coming is going to be like the elevator doors opening up in the shining. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8169.0s)]
*  That's what I think. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8176.0s)]
*  I think people are just like what the fuck are you saying. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8177.0s)]
*  They're making Republicans. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8180.0s)]
*  I don't know how they're doing it. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8182.0s)]
*  It's I had a family member who is an who's a boomer and a diehard liberal and they told me when I was home this summer that they would vote for DeSantis. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8184.0s)]
*  And I'm like how did you lose this person. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8192.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8194.0s)]
*  How did you lose this person. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8195.0s)]
*  This is a this is a like go to the ballot and vote blue no matter what. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8196.0s)]
*  And you've lost even the boomers. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8201.0s)]
*  You've lost a lot of them that aren't talking about. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8206.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8208.0s)]
*  There's a lot of them. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8209.0s)]
*  You know you're seeing in New York City. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8210.0s)]
*  Holchel like debating that Republican candidate that guy gained ground like they're they're worried about New York becoming Republican which is one of the things that's happening. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8212.0s)]
*  I was reading last night an article about in Oregon. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8222.0s)]
*  There is there's an independent woman running and then a Democrat and a Republican and the Republican they think might win. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8227.0s)]
*  Biden was in Oregon like stumping for the Democratic candidate because they're so worried Oregon's going to have a Republican governor the first time in 40 years. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8235.0s)]
*  That's why Oregon. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8248.0s)]
*  Well it almost happened in New York City or in New Jersey rather. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8249.0s)]
*  Or Jersey got down to the wire and New Jersey is another place. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8252.0s)]
*  Yeah it's always been Democrat. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8255.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8257.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8258.0s)]
*  And again I really think that all the polls and all that stuff that's indicative of like the mindset of a lot of people that are willing to take polls. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8259.0s)]
*  Which is not that many not that many but there's a lot of people silently that are like what the fuck is going on. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8268.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8274.0s)]
*  And it's not just that it's crime. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8275.0s)]
*  Crime is a big one. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8276.0s)]
*  The way they're handling crime the way they're releasing people that are committing violent crimes and then putting them right back on the street. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8278.0s)]
*  People are freaking the fuck out. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8284.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8286.0s)]
*  The way they're handling the homeless situation. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8288.0s)]
*  The way that you see we looked at this video the other day of in Portland. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8289.0s)]
*  They were showing discarded needles that they've collected from the streets. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8293.0s)]
*  They had fucking barrels of them. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8297.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8299.0s)]
*  Barrels and barrels of these discarded needles. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8300.0s)]
*  We have. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8303.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8304.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8305.0s)]
*  I mean. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8306.0s)]
*  And it's what's crazy too is you there's just this like fundamental disdain for the taxpaying people. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8307.0s)]
*  This is this guy. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8316.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8317.0s)]
*  Give me volume on this. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8318.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8322.0s)]

*  Who fucking know. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8329.0s)]
*  Demonstration of how many used needles picked up off the streets. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8330.0s)]
*  How how like what what is it. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8334.0s)]

*  Well they're all destroyed. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8337.0s)]
*  They destroy them. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8338.0s)]
*  Those are all destroyed needles that they found in Portland. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8339.0s)]
*  That whole bag. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8343.0s)]
*  How over the course of how long. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8344.0s)]
*  Like a year. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8347.0s)]
*  No. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8348.0s)]
*  No they're not keeping them. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8349.0s)]
*  I want to know how long this was. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8351.0s)]
*  I don't know but look at how many. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8353.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8355.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8356.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8357.0s)]
*  That's them cleaning it up. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8358.0s)]
*  Morgan. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8359.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8360.0s)]
*  This is why they might have a Republican governor. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8361.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8362.0s)]
*  I mean it's it's. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8363.0s)]
*  But like I was saying the disdain they have for the taxpaying just like hardworking person [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8365.0s)]
*  where it feels like they will put prioritize the criminal before they prioritize the people [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8370.0s)]
*  who just want safe parks for their kids and are paying taxes. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8377.0s)]
*  That's I don't understand. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8381.0s)]
*  How did that narrative even begin to get established. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8382.0s)]
*  That's what's so confusing to me. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8385.0s)]
*  I know the big conspiracy theories. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8387.0s)]
*  George Soros is trying to destroy America and he's funding these left wing politicians [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8389.0s)]
*  and progressive you know district attorneys and they're just and then he'll fund an even [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8393.0s)]
*  more progressive one to run against them. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8398.0s)]
*  Why is he trying to destroy America. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8400.0s)]
*  I think he thinks it's fun. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8402.0s)]
*  Oh I think that's his hobby. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8403.0s)]
*  That's the conspiracy theory. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8408.0s)]
*  That's the conspiracy. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8409.0s)]
*  But he spent billions of dollars on campaigns. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8410.0s)]
*  So you think this is how it's just like been institutionalized and been. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8413.0s)]
*  Well if you wanted to do it. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8418.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8419.0s)]
*  That's how you would do it. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8420.0s)]
*  You would fund like DA's and yeah fund district attorneys fund politicians that are like super [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8421.0s)]
*  progressive and want to let criminals out and want to you know institute laws that don't keep [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8429.0s)]
*  people safe. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8436.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8437.0s)]
*  That was that's how you would destroy cities. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8438.0s)]
*  If you really wanted to do it. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8439.0s)]
*  That's how you would. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8440.0s)]
*  I mean talk about the Joker letting prisoners free. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8441.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8444.0s)]
*  It's all projection. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8445.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8446.0s)]
*  Do you remember when that happened when that movie came out. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8447.0s)]
*  I remember I went to see my wife and we're in the movie theater and we're watching the Joker [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8449.0s)]
*  and she's like this seems a little too close to what's possible. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8452.0s)]
*  It's a little on the nose. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8455.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8456.0s)]
*  It's a little too on the nose. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8457.0s)]
*  I mean that was the best version of the Joker ever. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8458.0s)]
*  Ever. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8460.0s)]
*  Ever. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8461.0s)]
*  That movie is amazing. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8462.0s)]
*  It's fucking good. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8463.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8464.0s)]
*  And they're doing a Joker 2 right now. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8465.0s)]
*  Oh really. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8466.0s)]
*  Which is like where are they going to. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8467.0s)]
*  Are they going to predict the future even further. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8468.0s)]
*  Because you got to remember the Joker 1 came out before the pandemic and everything accelerated [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8469.0s)]
*  during the pandemic. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8474.0s)]
*  Remember they were like there are going to be shootings in the in the because of this [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8475.0s)]
*  movie there are going to be shootings in the movie theaters and they came out and nothing [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8478.0s)]
*  happened. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8483.0s)]
*  But it did sort of project this feeling that a lot of people that are disenfranchised had [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8484.0s)]
*  that the real problem is the rich people and the powerful. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8491.0s)]
*  We just need to fucking anarchy and take over and shoot everybody. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8495.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8498.0s)]
*  And you saw that during the BLM protests like some people sort of embracing that. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8499.0s)]
*  But it's weird. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8503.0s)]
*  They didn't necessarily go after like the people in power and the rich people. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8504.0s)]
*  Although a lot of the destruction happened to like very small businesses. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8509.0s)]
*  And in the pandemic one of the things that broke me is the largest transfer of wealth [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8515.0s)]
*  upwardly occurred during the pandemic. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8520.0s)]
*  And you saw the destruction of small business. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8523.0s)]
*  My friend Carol Roth is brilliant on this and wrote a book The War on Small Business [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8526.0s)]
*  all about this. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8531.0s)]
*  And she it's it is maddening what happened during the pandemic to small businesses in [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8532.0s)]
*  particular which are a huge backbone of America. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8538.0s)]
*  But they don't really like small businesses because they're independent. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8541.0s)]
*  They're like you can't really control them. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8545.0s)]
*  But do you think that that was a conspiracy or do you think that that was just a byproduct [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8547.0s)]
*  of bad policy? [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8551.0s)]
*  I don't I if you want to be conspiratorially minded you'd say it's a grand orchestrated [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8553.0s)]
*  conspiracy to promote the Great Reset. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8559.0s)]
*  That's the narrative. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8561.0s)]
*  Right. And I mean perhaps it is like really. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8562.0s)]
*  I don't know. I'm not a conspirator. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8567.0s)]
*  I'm generally like Michael Shermer who I think you recently had on. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8569.0s)]
*  He's a skeptic. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8572.0s)]
*  I generally lean towards like how many people would have to believe this in order for it [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8573.0s)]
*  to be true or keep it a secret in order for it to be people can't keep secrets. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8578.0s)]
*  Yeah. But at the World Economic Forum they're not keeping secrets. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8582.0s)]
*  No they're being open about it openly. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8585.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean I think she's working on another book and I'm not sure if I'm allowed to talk [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8587.0s)]
*  about it but I believe it's it's addressing a lot of these policies that are like the kind [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8592.0s)]
*  of idea that you owe nothing. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8598.0s)]
*  You'll live in a pod. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8600.0s)]
*  You'll eat bugs. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8601.0s)]
*  But the small business stuff was infuriating because you had things like Wal-Mart allowed [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8602.0s)]
*  to stay open. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8608.0s)]
*  Little local store had to shut down. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8609.0s)]
*  So these little mom and pops all got destroyed. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8612.0s)]
*  And even during the George Floyd riots I've donated I used to live in Minneapolis. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8615.0s)]
*  One of the places I went to after rehab was right down the street from that police station [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8621.0s)]
*  on Lake Street that like burned down. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8625.0s)]
*  And it was that neighborhood is all small businesses and I still get emails for them. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8628.0s)]
*  They're like two years later and we're raising more money and they're still rebuilding. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8633.0s)]
*  They're still trying to bring back you know the like two years after the damage. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8638.0s)]
*  They're still trying to fundraise and bring back. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8644.0s)]
*  It was it was very destructive for people. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8647.0s)]
*  They lost their whole business and livelihoods. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8650.0s)]
*  Yeah and it takes a long time for things to come back. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8652.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8655.0s)]
*  It's easy to destroy things. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8656.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8657.0s)]
*  But to rebuild them. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8658.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8659.0s)]
*  It takes forever. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8660.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8661.0s)]
*  I mean you see it with natural disasters like the hurricane in Florida which weirdly I mean [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8662.0s)]
*  the destruction down there is so bad. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8667.0s)]
*  I don't that's weird one too. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8669.0s)]
*  I don't know why that didn't get like. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8671.0s)]
*  It feels like it just came through and then they're like well good luck Florida. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8673.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8677.0s)]
*  But there was a lot of the narrative with like the people of Florida. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8678.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8680.0s)]
*  Well that's what you get for denying climate change. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8681.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8683.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8684.0s)]
*  Not a charitable way to go through life. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8685.0s)]
*  Horrible because how many of those people were actually left wing. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8688.0s)]
*  How many of those people are Democrats. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8690.0s)]
*  How many of those people didn't deny climate change. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8691.0s)]
*  They just happen to live in Florida. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8693.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8694.0s)]
*  They got fucked by a natural disaster. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8695.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8696.0s)]
*  It used to be like people had sympathy for people during natural disasters. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8697.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8700.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8701.0s)]
*  It's a weird time to be in America. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8702.0s)]
*  I mean it's definitely like it feels on edge. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8705.0s)]
*  You know everyone feels a little bit on edge and like the Joker movie. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8709.0s)]
*  And you said this this is at its core I think it is a class war. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8712.0s)]
*  It's just masked by all of this division. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8717.0s)]
*  And I do think there's a lot of resentment and people are mad but they're not there. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8722.0s)]
*  It's easier to like be mad at your neighbor than it is to be mad at Nancy Pelosi. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8729.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8734.0s)]
*  But did you see that fricking amazing. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8735.0s)]
*  It went viral. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8737.0s)]
*  It was the guy right after Roe v Wade and he was mad at the Democrats for sending him [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8738.0s)]
*  emails and he was like quit sending me emails. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8743.0s)]
*  And he starts going through how many how much all of the people who are sending him emails [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8746.0s)]
*  Democratic leaders were worth. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8751.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8754.0s)]
*  It is. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8755.0s)]
*  Well they were asking for money. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8756.0s)]
*  I should find. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8757.0s)]
*  You got to give us money. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8758.0s)]
*  I mean they just use it was total opportunism. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8759.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8762.0s)]
*  But he's like Nancy Pelosi. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8763.0s)]
*  It was it's the funniest rant. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8764.0s)]
*  I should say her husband got attacked last night. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8765.0s)]
*  Yeah I saw it. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8768.0s)]
*  I broke into their house and attacked him with a hammer. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8769.0s)]
*  Do they know why. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8773.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8774.0s)]
*  Was it like I just saw the story. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8775.0s)]
*  Supposedly he was asking where Nancy was. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8776.0s)]
*  Oh Jesus Christ. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8779.0s)]

*  Oh geez. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8784.0s)]
*  How bad is he. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8785.0s)]
*  Is he OK. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8786.0s)]
*  I believe I read non life threatening injuries but he is in the hospital. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8787.0s)]
*  I think he was having surgery. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8791.0s)]
*  I'm checking. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8792.0s)]

*  Isn't she like the third. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8797.0s)]
*  People hate them. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8798.0s)]
*  Isn't she like the third in line though for being president. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8799.0s)]
*  The assailant was yelling where is Nancy according to a person briefed in the assault. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8802.0s)]

*  2 27 a.m. Friday. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8836.0s)]
*  Chief William Scott said a news conference the assailant who pulled a hammer from Mr. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8840.0s)]
*  Pelosi and violently attacked him in front of the police officer in front of police officers. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=8845.0s)]

*  And that's like Internet culture for like, fuck my dick. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9255.0s)]
*  I have to go touch base with my husband and wife. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9259.0s)]
*  My husband and wife. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9262.0s)]
*  Well, that's not that good. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9264.0s)]
*  Not compared to that last rant. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9266.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9268.0s)]
*  I watch it like once. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9269.0s)]
*  It gives me life. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9270.0s)]
*  It just. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9271.0s)]
*  Well, that's the Joker. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9272.0s)]
*  The Joker revolt revolts against that shit. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9273.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9275.0s)]
*  That's the shit that should infuriate everybody. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9276.0s)]
*  It should infuriate all of us. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9278.0s)]
*  Super wealthy people that have gotten wealthy by scamming the system. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9279.0s)]
*  And that's what they're doing. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9282.0s)]
*  They're pretending that they're helping people. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9283.0s)]
*  They're pretending that they're in that position of power and they're going to help people. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9285.0s)]
*  They're going to help people. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9288.0s)]
*  And then, Nancy, do you think you should stop inside a train? [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9290.0s)]
*  No. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9293.0s)]
*  No. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9294.0s)]
*  She'll publicly say she's for it. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9295.0s)]
*  And privately, like probably undermine the whole thing. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9298.0s)]
*  When they first confronted her, she said, I know, I think we should be able to participate. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9301.0s)]
*  Of course. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9305.0s)]
*  Of course you do. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9306.0s)]
*  Of course you do. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9307.0s)]
*  You made a hundred million dollars on a hundred thousand dollar a year salary. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9308.0s)]
*  It's fucking bananas. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9311.0s)]
*  That's, I mean, that rage, I felt it in my soul. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9313.0s)]
*  And it really was my, it tapped into like my 20 year old, like liberal roots. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9318.0s)]
*  You know, I know I've said before on here, like I was AOC in my 20s. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9324.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9328.0s)]
*  And I really understand that because she, say what you want about AOC, but she's working class. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9329.0s)]
*  She came from the working class and was a bartender. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9335.0s)]
*  So I feel like at least it's nice to have someone and they hate her because she's. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9339.0s)]
*  But don't you think you start that way? [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9343.0s)]
*  And then when you get into that system, if you want to succeed, you want to succeed in that system, you become a part of that system. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9345.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9351.0s)]
*  You become like, what, what is that system amplify? [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9352.0s)]
*  What is that system reward? [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9355.0s)]
*  It rewards compliance with the party. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9357.0s)]
*  And that's what she seems to be doing. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9360.0s)]
*  And that's why, like at her town halls, they become a clusterfuck now because people are screaming at her. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9362.0s)]
*  Like you're supporting war. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9366.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9368.0s)]
*  You're supporting sending money to Ukraine. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9369.0s)]
*  It's going to get us all fucking killed. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9370.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9372.0s)]
*  You've seen all that. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9373.0s)]
*  That is wild. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9374.0s)]
*  Yeah, I saw something. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9375.0s)]
*  And the thing is like, she's the one who said that people should, we should make these people uncomfortable. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9376.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9380.0s)]
*  We should make people uncomfortable. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9381.0s)]
*  But now it's coming back to her. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9382.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9383.0s)]
*  Well, cause now she's in power. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9384.0s)]
*  Well, these fucking people, when they get into that position, they realize what is that position. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9385.0s)]
*  You want to be president? [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9390.0s)]
*  Do you want to play ball? [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9391.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9392.0s)]
*  You want to, you want to keep fucking kicking ass and get further up the ladder? [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9393.0s)]
*  Maybe you can help people when you do. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9396.0s)]
*  Maybe you can help people, but you got to play ball. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9397.0s)]
*  And they're all playing ball. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9399.0s)]
*  And she's playing ball. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9400.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9401.0s)]
*  I think that they're, I'm thinking of this podcast I did the other day with this woman and I think it's called, oh my gosh, again, my brain is mush. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9402.0s)]
*  My brain is mush. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9411.0s)]
*  But I like giving people the right credit when it's due. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9413.0s)]
*  And she has this podcast and she came on and was talking about how really it's like they, they do the best faith interpretation. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9418.0s)]
*  Is that these leaders do think they're helping people, but it's helping one another. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9425.0s)]
*  They're helping the investor class is what she called it and not the working class. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9430.0s)]
*  And so she's like, well, Nancy Pelosi does. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9436.0s)]
*  They just aren't dealing with people who work for a paycheck. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9438.0s)]
*  They're working with people who make their money in dividends. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9444.0s)]
*  And so they are helping those people and they're helping themselves. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9447.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9451.0s)]
*  And they do things where they it's it's a signal that they're doing the right thing. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9452.0s)]
*  Like one of the things that Biden did, Biden came out and said, we are going to release all the people that are in jail for marijuana possession in federal prison. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9457.0s)]
*  It was like no one. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9467.0s)]
*  There's no one. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9468.0s)]
*  That's how many people are in jail for marijuana possession. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9469.0s)]
*  Because they all pretty much have been released. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9471.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9473.0s)]
*  It's usually they have another crime attached if they're still in jail. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9474.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9477.0s)]
*  For marijuana possession. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9478.0s)]
*  People that are in jail federally are growers. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9479.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9482.0s)]
*  And you know, how about release those people? [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9483.0s)]
*  If it's OK to possess it, why isn't it OK to grow it? [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9485.0s)]
*  It's called Congressional Dish. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9489.0s)]
*  And it's this woman, Jennifer Briney, she came on my podcast and she was talking about she does what she does with her podcast, which I really should start listening to as she gets into like every bill and what's being put into it. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9491.0s)]
*  So she'll look deeply into the bills, which is a lot of work, a lot of work. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9503.0s)]
*  Those things are huge. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9507.0s)]
*  A lot of work. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9508.0s)]
*  And she'll go and she you know, I asked her like, how do you get over your biases? [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9509.0s)]
*  She's like, I'm just open about my bias because I don't think you can get around them. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9513.0s)]
*  And so she has this podcast where she'll go in and look at like some of the crazy stuff that gets passed attached to one bill that's for one thing. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9517.0s)]
*  I just don't understand how, again, that's legal. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9527.0s)]
*  Give us an example. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9529.0s)]
*  Like she gave the example of. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9531.0s)]
*  Let me think the bill that she was talking about that a lot of things were attached to was I think there was a lot of stuff with like the PPP loans where the in last minute things get attached all the time. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9539.0s)]
*  The example she gave was of the government shutdowns, the debt ceiling, and they'll always cram in all these different things that they want to pass because they're basically like nice government you have there. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9554.0s)]
*  It'd be a shame if something happened to it. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9565.0s)]
*  And then they try and get these other crazy things that have nothing to do with the government shutting down. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9568.0s)]
*  Like what? [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9572.0s)]
*  Oh, gosh. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9574.0s)]
*  Why is my brain mush, Joe? [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9575.0s)]
*  There there was one with the debt ceiling recently that she was talking about and I cannot for the life of me remember it. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9578.0s)]
*  It was it was they're always doing this. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9585.0s)]
*  You can. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9587.0s)]
*  But that's commonplace. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9590.0s)]
*  It's common to do this. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9592.0s)]
*  What they do. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9593.0s)]
*  And they'll put it in a bill that has a name like let's help poor kids. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9594.0s)]
*  Let's write poor kids bill. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9599.0s)]
*  But let's say I had a better example. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9601.0s)]
*  There's there's Justin Amash when he was on the podcast was talking about how it shouldn't be like this. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9603.0s)]
*  It should be like you have a bill for one thing and it's not two thousand pages that every that no one's read that they get two days before it's supposed to pass with everybody's kind of special interests that they've tacked in. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9609.0s)]
*  I wish I had a better. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9624.0s)]
*  There are so many good examples of just like ridiculous things tacked into bills that are ostensibly for one thing. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9625.0s)]
*  And then it's like, but we need to. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9631.0s)]
*  How does that ever get fixed if people become a part of that system once they get elected and then they go to Washington and they see how it all works and they see what it takes to succeed. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9633.0s)]
*  And that's that's the job they're in. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9645.0s)]
*  They're in this business to try to succeed and you want to keep getting elected and you want to keep working with all those people. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9647.0s)]
*  That's your job now. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9655.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not working with all the people. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9657.0s)]
*  It's the special interests who they're they're being funded by. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9659.0s)]
*  It's like the pharmaceutical companies and whoever might be funding their next campaign. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9663.0s)]
*  So they're not working for the people. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9669.0s)]
*  Of course, they're working for the corporation. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9671.0s)]
*  So I mean, how do you fix this? [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9673.0s)]
*  I would say you would make it so that you would have to pass a law where it has to just be one one thing per bill, which we could do. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9675.0s)]
*  It doesn't have to be like this. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9684.0s)]
*  You could set maybe term limits so we don't have insane people who are in their 80s and don't know where they are running the country still. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9686.0s)]
*  I think there are definitely ways we could fix it. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9696.0s)]
*  But the problem is the people in power, they don't want to fix it. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9698.0s)]
*  You need people who you need people in these positions who don't necessarily want power. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9702.0s)]
*  But nobody nobody wants to run for the corporate run media. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9707.0s)]
*  There's just gaslighting everybody. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9710.0s)]
*  Right. Of course. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9712.0s)]
*  Try to like we're talking about the debate how MSNBC was like, you know, what he has has a problem forming a sense, but he doesn't have any cognitive decline. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9713.0s)]
*  The Federman Oz debate. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9721.0s)]
*  How the fuck do you know he doesn't have cognitive decline? [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9723.0s)]
*  He seems like he does. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9725.0s)]
*  I want to know if he can drive. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9727.0s)]
*  I feel like that would be a good sign of whether or not he has cognitive decline. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9729.0s)]
*  Right. I have cognitive. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9733.0s)]
*  I'm a mom. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9735.0s)]
*  No, that I couldn't even watch it. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9736.0s)]
*  It felt it felt mean. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9739.0s)]
*  You know, that's what I want to know. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9740.0s)]
*  Find out if that debate is actually being removed from the Internet. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9742.0s)]
*  See if you can find the debate because that's the Reddit conspiracy thread is that people are removing that debate. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9747.0s)]
*  It's difficult to find. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9755.0s)]
*  Duncan was telling me this last night. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9757.0s)]
*  I said, I need to look into that. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9758.0s)]
*  What are the what are the polls saying? [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9760.0s)]
*  Like after that, is it it feels what is maddening about this situation with this debate, which I couldn't even people on Twitter were saying it was really bad and like it was hard to watch. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9762.0s)]
*  And I think if you have any empathy, this is hard to watch. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9774.0s)]
*  But it's also maddening because how entitled are you as a party that you're just going to be like, you have to vote for this person or you're ableist. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9777.0s)]
*  They're calling people ableist for not supporting a guy with some clear brain issue. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9786.0s)]
*  Yeah, he literally had a stroke five months ago. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9794.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9797.0s)]
*  And I had Dr. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9798.0s)]
*  Phil on yesterday and Dr. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9799.0s)]
*  Phil was explaining like the worst thing that you can do. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9800.0s)]
*  The worst thing you could do for someone like that is put him in a position of stress. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9803.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what that's why it's hard for it's hard to watch. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9808.0s)]
*  We used to kind of give like Biden. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9810.0s)]
*  We used to make fun of Biden all the time on Dom's Defy because he's the most powerful man in the world and you should. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9813.0s)]
*  But lately it just feels sad. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9818.0s)]
*  Did you find the debate? [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9820.0s)]
*  It's available on a bunch of clips. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9821.0s)]
*  I found the debate. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9824.0s)]
*  I don't what. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9825.0s)]
*  So the Reddit people are full. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9826.0s)]
*  I mean, you probably can't upload somebody else's content in one way. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9827.0s)]
*  So this is Florida. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9830.0s)]
*  This is a news debate about the whole thing. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9833.0s)]
*  This is a news piece. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9835.0s)]
*  This is a news opinion piece about the debate. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9837.0s)]
*  See if you can find the actual debate. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9839.0s)]
*  I've definitely found clips of it. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9843.0s)]
*  Yeah, but is the actual debate available? [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9845.0s)]
*  The primary source. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9848.0s)]
*  People are saying, well, the clips, they're taking them out of context. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9850.0s)]
*  And if you look at the whole thing, you didn't do that bad. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9853.0s)]
*  And he made some really good points and he had some good comebacks. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9855.0s)]
*  I don't like the fact that he wears hoodies everywhere. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9860.0s)]
*  Like I wear hoodies, but this is because this is what I actually wear. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9862.0s)]
*  You know, why do you think he wears them? [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9865.0s)]
*  Because he wants to look like a common man. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9867.0s)]
*  He's literally wearing Carhartt hoodies. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9869.0s)]
*  Oh, that's contrived. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9871.0s)]
*  Like, you know what Carhartt is? [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9873.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9875.0s)]
*  They're like working class, like real durable clothes. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9876.0s)]
*  They make great, great shit. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9878.0s)]
*  Best pants make great everything. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9880.0s)]
*  It's all fucking super durable stuff. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9881.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9883.0s)]
*  So he's wearing that like, you know, I'm a hard working man. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9884.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'm a working class dude. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9888.0s)]
*  What did he do? [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9891.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9892.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9893.0s)]
*  Maybe he was a working class. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9894.0s)]
*  So here's the actual debate. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9895.0s)]
*  This is an hour long video. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9897.0s)]
*  OK. But give me. So that's not true. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9899.0s)]
*  So people that were saying that it's not true. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9900.0s)]
*  They haven't removed the debate. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9902.0s)]
*  We've fact checked something. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9904.0s)]
*  Yeah, we fact checked this. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9905.0s)]
*  So play some of it. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9906.0s)]
*  In Pennsylvania, that ever got knocked down, that needs to get back up. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9908.0s)]
*  And fighting for all forgotten communities all across Pennsylvania. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9911.0s)]
*  That also got knocked down. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9915.0s)]
*  That needs to keep get back up. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9916.0s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9918.0s)]
*  Federer. Mr. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9919.0s)]
*  Oz, you are a doctor, a businessman and television personality. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9920.0s)]
*  But this is your first run for elected office. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9923.0s)]
*  What qualifies you to be a U.S. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9926.0s)]
*  Senator from Pennsylvania? [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9928.0s)]
*  You have 60 seconds. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9929.0s)]
*  I'm running for the U.S. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9931.0s)]
*  Senate because Washington keeps getting it wrong with extreme positions. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9932.0s)]
*  I want to bring civility, balance, all the things that you want to see, [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9936.0s)]
*  because you've been telling it to me on the campaign trail. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9941.0s)]
*  And by doing that, we can bring us together in a way that has not been done of late. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9943.0s)]
*  Democrats, Republicans talking to each other. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9947.0s)]
*  John Fetterman takes everything to an extreme and those extreme positions hurt us all. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9950.0s)]
*  Let's take crime as an example, because it's been such a big problem. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9955.0s)]
*  Maureen Faulkner accompanied me today to the studio. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9958.0s)]
*  You know, her husband was a police officer in Philadelphia, was brutally murdered. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9962.0s)]
*  John Fetterman during this crime wave has been trying to get as many murderers [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9966.0s)]
*  convicted and sentenced to life in prison out of jail as possible, [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9971.0s)]
*  including people who are similar to the man who murdered her husband. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9975.0s)]
*  He does it without the rest of the pro-border agreeing. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9978.0s)]
*  He's doing it without the families on board. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9981.0s)]
*  These radical positions extend beyond crime to wanting to legalize all drugs, [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9984.0s)]
*  to open the border, to raising our taxes. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9988.0s)]
*  I want Washington to be civil again. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9991.0s)]
*  You need it to be less radical. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9994.0s)]
*  John Fetterman, unfortunately, would bring that. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9997.0s)]
*  Okay. Mr. Oz, thank you. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9998.0s)]
*  Hold on, stop. Pause, pause, pause, pause. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=9999.0s)]
*  How crazy is it that you have someone who is running for the Senate [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10002.0s)]
*  and it's an extremely influential and powerful position, [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10008.0s)]
*  and you limit their expression to what was that, 30 seconds? [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10013.0s)]
*  I mean, I think I speak for most Americans. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10017.0s)]
*  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10020.0s)]
*  That's enough. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10023.0s)]
*  I think I speak for most Americans when I say these are our options. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10025.0s)]
*  This is the best we can do. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10030.0s)]
*  Well, what he said sounded fairly reasonable. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10032.0s)]
*  I mean, if he really wants to bring people together. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10034.0s)]
*  Didn't they used to talk for hours before they had these things, though? [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10036.0s)]
*  I think they would go for days, maybe, sometimes. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10038.0s)]
*  Well, that's what Lincoln used to do. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10040.0s)]
*  They used to do it with no microphone. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10041.0s)]
*  He's like, wrap it up. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10042.0s)]
*  Oz had a big gaffe, too, where he was trying to be like a common man [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10043.0s)]
*  in a grocery store that went viral. It was so bad. Oz. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10047.0s)]
*  Well, Oz was investigated for promoting fake weight loss. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10050.0s)]
*  Do you know that? No. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10055.0s)]
*  He was brought in front of Congress. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10057.0s)]
*  This was a real issue. Google this. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10059.0s)]
*  Oz promoted something that he's a doctor. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10062.0s)]
*  He's an actual doctor, and he promoted something [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10065.0s)]
*  that he was calling a miracle weight loss cure, [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10068.0s)]
*  because they were selling it, and they were selling it on his fucking show, [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10071.0s)]
*  which is, you know, Dr. Oz. Right. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10075.0s)]
*  So he's supposed to be an expert, and he's saying it's a miracle weight loss cure. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10078.0s)]
*  It didn't do fucking jack shit. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10082.0s)]
*  Listen, there's no miracle weight loss cure. No. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10084.0s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10087.0s)]
*  You want...well, actually, there's this semaglutide [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10088.0s)]
*  that a lot of the celebrities are taking. Is it new? [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10090.0s)]
*  Yeah, some peptide. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10093.0s)]
*  I feel like I've heard about this. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10094.0s)]
*  This is new that the Kardashians are supposed to be taking. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10096.0s)]
*  Dr. Oz hit with class action over miracle weight loss supplement claims. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10098.0s)]
*  Yeah, but he was actually forced to testify about this, [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10103.0s)]
*  and he admitted that it was not true. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10107.0s)]
*  I had a bit I was doing it for a while, that he's Oprah's bitch, [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10109.0s)]
*  and that Oprah's is pimp, and that she's like, [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10113.0s)]
*  you know, basically, you're going to let my girl back on the street, right? [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10115.0s)]
*  Because, like, she makes a lot of money off of his show. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10118.0s)]
*  If you have a fucking doctor show, and you say something that is absolutely not true, [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10121.0s)]
*  and you're selling something that's absolutely not a miracle, [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10125.0s)]
*  you probably shouldn't be doing that anymore. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10128.0s)]
*  Isn't... [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10130.0s)]
*  Find out what he was forced to testify, and see if we can find the video. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10131.0s)]
*  Wasn't there some controversy with Dr. Phil, too? [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10136.0s)]
*  Or was I... Is that someone else that I'm thinking of? [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10138.0s)]
*  I don't know about that. We'll find out. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10141.0s)]
*  But he's my boy, so shut the fuck up. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10142.0s)]
*  Product safety and insurance. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10144.0s)]
*  I don't know. I could be wrong. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10146.0s)]
*  Product safety and insurance during a hearing on false advertising in the diet weight loss industry, [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10148.0s)]
*  he presented his role clearly as the victim of unscrupulous advertisers' [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10152.0s)]
*  vicious attempts to twist his words to sell diet pills. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10156.0s)]
*  He was perfectly positioned to help Congress curb the tide of deceptive advertising. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10159.0s)]
*  There was only one problem with the doctor's plan. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10163.0s)]
*  Inside the hearing room, the members of the subcommittee had cast him in a different role, [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10165.0s)]
*  not as the victim of scheming fraudsters, but as the fraudster himself. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10169.0s)]
*  And I repeat... [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10173.0s)]
*  Scroll down. [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10174.0s)]
*  These are our options? [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10175.0s)]
*  For the duration of the hour-long hearing, members of the subcommittee lined up one after another to grill [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10176.0s)]
*  America's doctor for statements he made on the Dr. Oz Show, [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10180.0s)]
*  his daytime cable program on health and wellness, [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10183.0s)]
*  laying into him for endorsements of the miraculous powers of green coffee extract [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10186.0s)]
*  and the fat-burning magic of raspberry ketone. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10192.0s)]
*  From his spot behind the witness table, Oz refused to back down. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10196.0s)]
*  He brandished printouts of scientific studies to defend his statements about various weight loss supplements [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10200.0s)]
*  and cited transcripts of his TV appearances to show how advertisers had taken his words out of context. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10205.0s)]
*  At one point during the question-and-answer portion of the testimony, [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10211.0s)]
*  Senator Claire McCaskill, the subcommittee's chair, [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10214.0s)]
*  drew visibly agitated at Oz's evasiveness, blurting out, [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10218.0s)]
*  I've tried to do a lot of research in preparation for this trial, [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10222.0s)]
*  and the scientific community is almost monolithic against you. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10225.0s)]
*  It was a hearing, not a trial, but McCaskill's slip was telling. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10229.0s)]
*  The committee was trying to put pseudoscience on trial, and Oz was the star witness. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10232.0s)]
*  Seven years after his dressing down at Capitol Hill, Oz is making a bid to return to Washington. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10237.0s)]
*  See if you can find the testimony, because the testimony, he was forced to say that it wasn't a weight loss miracle. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10244.0s)]
*  Did he get in trouble at all? [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10251.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think he got fined. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10253.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10254.0s)]
*  But I need to find out if that's true. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10255.0s)]
*  Senator Skoll, Dr. Oz for diet, click on that, let's see what it says, because it's only a minute and a half. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10257.0s)]
*  This is the options, these are options. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10263.0s)]
*  A fraudster and a stroke victim. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10266.0s)]
*  Well, maybe he was scammed, I mean, I don't know, what the fuck. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10270.0s)]
*  Let's see what actually happened. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10273.0s)]
*  Here it goes. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10275.0s)]
*  Dr. Oz, I get that you do a lot of good on your show. [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10276.0s)]
*  I understand that you give a lot of information that's great information about health, [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10283.0s)]
*  and you do it in a way that's easily understandable. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10291.0s)]
*  You're very talented, you're obviously very bright, you've been trained in science-based medicine. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10293.0s)]
*  Now, here's three statements you made on your show. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10299.0s)]
*  You may think magic is make-believe, but this little bean has scientists saying they found the magic weight loss cure for every body type. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10303.0s)]
*  It's green coffee extract. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10311.0s)]
*  Quote, I've got the number one miracle in a bottle to burn your fat. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10313.0s)]
*  It's raspberry ketone. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10318.0s)]
*  Quote, Garcinia cambogia, it may be the simple solution you've been looking for to bust your body fat for good. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10320.0s)]
*  I don't get why you need to say this stuff, because you know it's not true. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10328.0s)]
*  I actually do personally believe in the items that I talk about in the show. [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10333.0s)]
*  I passionately study them. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10337.0s)]
*  I recognize that oftentimes they don't have the scientific muster to present as fact, [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10339.0s)]
*  but nevertheless I would give my audience the advice I give my family all the time, and I've given my family these products. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10344.0s)]
*  And when you call a product a miracle, and it's something you can buy, and it's something that gives people false hope, [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10350.0s)]
*  I just don't understand why you need to go there. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10356.0s)]
*  My job, I feel, on the show is to be a cheerleader for the audience. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10359.0s)]
*  And when they don't think they have hope, when they don't think they can make it happen, [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10363.0s)]
*  I want to look, and I do look everywhere, including at alternative healing traditions, for any evidence that might be supportive to them. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10366.0s)]
*  I will just tell you that I know you feel that you're a victim, but sometimes conduct invites being a victim. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10372.0s)]
*  Now, let's Google whether or not that shit actually works. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10382.0s)]
*  Does any of that shit actually work? [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10386.0s)]
*  It's certainly not a miracle. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10388.0s)]
*  There's no fucking miracles when it comes to weight loss. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10389.0s)]
*  It's real, calories in, calories out. [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10391.0s)]
*  And it's also some things that promote inflammation, like we talked about with seed oils and, you know, processed corn syrup and all that shit. [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10394.0s)]
*  It makes people fatter. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10402.0s)]
*  And it also promotes excess calorie consumption because it's very addictive. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10403.0s)]
*  That stuff, yeah, if you can get that out of your diet, but it's not a miracle. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10408.0s)]
*  It's science. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10412.0s)]
*  It's real clear cause and effect. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10413.0s)]
*  Did he think this was science? [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10415.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10418.0s)]
*  I suddenly had a vision of you being like, Nero, this gum does work. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10420.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it does. There's science behind that. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10425.0s)]
*  That's the difference. Double blind placebo control studies. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10427.0s)]
*  But that's what I'm wondering. Did he think there was science? [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10429.0s)]
*  There is no evidence that raspberry ketones cause weight loss in humans. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10431.0s)]
*  And rat studies that suggest they may work use massive doses. [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10435.0s)]
*  Like was he misled? [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10439.0s)]
*  The rats probably got sick from it and didn't eat as much. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10441.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10443.0s)]
*  Massive doses of raspberry ketones. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10445.0s)]
*  They're like, this is gross. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10447.0s)]
*  The rats are like, I'm just gonna fucking lose weight. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10448.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm wondering is why did he think this stuff worked or was he just lying? [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10450.0s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, I think he's selling his show is about like, you know, getting people engaged and self-improvement and all that stuff. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10454.0s)]
*  And maybe he just exaggerated the effects. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10463.0s)]
*  But you can't say miracle. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10465.0s)]
*  No. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10467.0s)]
*  Because it was a miracle. Everybody takes him and goes six pack, bang. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10468.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10471.0s)]
*  And that's not real. That's not real. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10472.0s)]
*  There's no easy way to lose weight. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10473.0s)]
*  No. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10475.0s)]
*  Unfortunately. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10476.0s)]
*  Maybe the semi-glutide shit. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10477.0s)]
*  Yeah, tell me about this. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10478.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is a, it's a peptide, I believe. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10479.0s)]
*  And it's an injectable, I believe. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10483.0s)]
*  I think it's, I think the injected into fat. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10485.0s)]
*  And I think from what I understand, I'm butchering this, but, Jan, you'll find out the facts. [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10489.0s)]
*  I think what it does is it suppresses your appetite and it gives you the sensation that you're full. [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10494.0s)]
*  Okay. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10500.0s)]
*  And the word is. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10501.0s)]
*  Forever. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10502.0s)]
*  This is the word. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10503.0s)]
*  I haven't investigated this past discussing it on this podcast. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10504.0s)]
*  I should be really transparent about that. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10507.0s)]
*  But people have said that using it is causing them to lose weight. [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10509.0s)]
*  And the narrative is that all these people that are fitness influencers or public people, influencers online, that have lost weight are using this semi-glutide. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10515.0s)]
*  Oh. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10526.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10527.0s)]
*  That's so shady. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10528.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't know if they're saying that they use it and promoting that they use it or if other people are pointing to this is what's causing them to lose weight. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10529.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10537.0s)]
*  I don't know that any social media influencers are telling people to take these peptides. [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10538.0s)]
*  No, I mean, it's shady when you do something like that and then you're like, it's just the squats. [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10542.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10547.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10548.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10549.0s)]
*  And not saying like this isn't. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10550.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10551.0s)]
*  It's Brazilian butt lift also. [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10552.0s)]
*  Semi-glutide, sold under the brand names Wigovie and Ozempic, among others, is an anti-diabetic medication used for the treatment of type two diabetes and long-term weight management. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10554.0s)]
*  What does it do? [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10567.0s)]

*  Above that, right there. [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10585.0s)]
*  Semi-glutide injection is a class of medications called in-cratein mimetics. [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10587.0s)]
*  It works by helping the pancreas release the right amount of insulin when blood sugar levels are high. [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10594.0s)]
*  Insulin helps move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used as energy. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10601.0s)]
*  So is semi-glutide good for weight loss? [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10607.0s)]
*  Click on that. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10611.0s)]
*  Semi-glutide treatment effect in people with obesity trials have shown the efficacy of semi-glutide for the treatment of obesity. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10612.0s)]
*  In large RCTs, random controlled trials, patients receiving semi-glutide 2.4 milligrams lost a mean of 6% of their weight by week 12 and 12% of their weight by week 28. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10619.0s)]
*  So that's legit. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10632.0s)]
*  But again, science. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10633.0s)]
*  Seven months though, right? [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10636.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10638.0s)]
*  But that's a lot of weight. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10639.0s)]
*  Losing 12% of your weight. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10640.0s)]
*  And if you lose, if you're 100 pounds, you're losing 12 pounds in seven months. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10642.0s)]
*  12% of your weight is legitimate. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10647.0s)]
*  It's not miracle, but it's legitimate weight loss. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10648.0s)]
*  12 pounds in seven months though? [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10651.0s)]
*  I mean, 12% not 12 pounds. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10653.0s)]
*  Well, if you're 100 pounds. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10655.0s)]
*  No, if you're 100 pounds, that's what I'm saying. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10656.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10659.0s)]
*  But this is right. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10660.0s)]
*  I don't know that anybody that's 100 pounds to be taken to be people that are overweight. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10661.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10663.0s)]
*  But I'm just saying it's 12. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10664.0s)]
*  That's 12%. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10665.0s)]
*  I'm just giving an example of what 12% is. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10666.0s)]
*  So weight loss outcomes associated with semi-glutide. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10668.0s)]
*  So that's click on that. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10672.0s)]
*  JAMA network, weight loss outcomes associated with semi-glutide. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10674.0s)]
*  So key points. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10679.0s)]
*  Is treatment with semi-glutide associated with weight loss outcomes similar to those [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10681.0s)]
*  seen in the results of randomized control trials findings? [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10685.0s)]
*  In this cohort study of 175 patients with overweight or obesity, the total weight loss [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10688.0s)]
*  percentage achieved were 5.9% at three months and 10.9% at six months. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10693.0s)]
*  Semi-glutide treatment in the regular clinical setting was associated with weight loss similar [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10699.0s)]
*  to that seen in randomized clinical trials would suggest its applicability for treating [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10703.0s)]
*  patients with overweight or obesity. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10709.0s)]
*  I mean, they will figure something out eventually, right? [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10711.0s)]
*  Well, this seems at least to be partially successful. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10714.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10716.0s)]
*  Objective, study weight loss outcomes associated with semi-glutide treatment at doses used [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10717.0s)]
*  in randomized clinical trials for patients with overweight or obesity. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10722.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10728.0s)]
*  Huh. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10729.0s)]
*  OK. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10730.0s)]
*  So this is a total of 408 patients with body mass index of 27 or more were prescribed weekly [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10731.0s)]
*  semi-glutide subcutaneous injections for three months or more. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10738.0s)]
*  Patients with a history of bariatric procedures taking other anti-obesity medications and [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10742.0s)]
*  with an active malignment neoplasm were excluded. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10751.0s)]
*  And the exposures weekly 1.7 milligrams or 2.4 milligrams semi-glutide subcutaneous injections [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10755.0s)]
*  for three to six months, the main outcomes, that's what we read. [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10763.0s)]
*  So it looks like it does have some efficacy. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10767.0s)]
*  Huh. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10771.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10772.0s)]
*  I feel like they'll find a quick fix. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10773.0s)]
*  24, 23% achieved weight loss of 15% or more and 8% received a weight loss of 20% or more. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10774.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10782.0s)]
*  That's a lot. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10783.0s)]
*  So with some people it's really effective. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10784.0s)]
*  The results of this cohort study suggest that weekly 1.7 milligram and 2.4 milligram doses [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10787.0s)]
*  of semi-glutide were associated with weight loss similar to that seen in randomized controlled [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10793.0s)]
*  clinical trials. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10798.0s)]
*  So it seems like it works. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10799.0s)]
*  Wow. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10800.0s)]
*  There you go. [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10801.0s)]
*  Studies with longer periods of follow-up are needed to evaluate prolonged weight loss outcomes. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10802.0s)]
*  Oh. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10807.0s)]
*  I kind of wonder what kind of diet they're working out they did. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10808.0s)]
*  There's the rub. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10810.0s)]
*  The rub is that you have to probably continue using it. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10811.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10814.0s)]
*  What was that, Jamie? [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10815.0s)]
*  What kind of diet and working out they did during that six month period? [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10816.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10818.0s)]
*  I'm curious too. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10819.0s)]
*  Right. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10820.0s)]
*  Did they live their life normally and not change anything or was this a part of like [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10821.0s)]
*  an overall health plan where they were trying to like improve their health? [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10824.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10828.0s)]
*  Was this the only thing they did or were they like, oh, they also made a lot of lifestyle [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10829.0s)]
*  changes that would cause you to lose weight? [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10833.0s)]
*  They ran six miles a day and they only ate green vegetables and lean meat and yeah. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10834.0s)]
*  Last time I was here we were talking about paternity leave and I was on the fence and [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10839.0s)]
*  now after having C-section I am pro paternity leave. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10843.0s)]
*  At least for a month I needed help. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10847.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10850.0s)]
*  No, women most certainly need it. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10851.0s)]
*  I freaking needed the help. [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10852.0s)]
*  I couldn't even, you can't lift anything. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10854.0s)]
*  Right. [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10856.0s)]
*  That was one thing that was shocking to me about the recovery from the C-section. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10857.0s)]
*  That early like six weeks. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10862.0s)]
*  I was, I didn't for some reason because my mom had five and I don't remember and so many [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10865.0s)]
*  kids. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10870.0s)]
*  I don't remember her being, she was younger though. [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10871.0s)]
*  I don't remember her being so laid up but it was bad. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10873.0s)]
*  Well, any surgery. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10877.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10878.0s)]
*  Any time you get your body cut like that. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10879.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10881.0s)]
*  Like there's a long recovery period. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10882.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10883.0s)]
*  Especially when you get into your 40s. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10884.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10885.0s)]
*  It's difficult for your body to respond and recover. [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10886.0s)]
*  Well that's the other thing too with like why I tell people don't wait to have the babies [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10889.0s)]
*  because it gets more dangerous as you get older and because I'm a geriatric pregnancy, [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10894.0s)]
*  they don't let you like go over your due, after I think like 40, they don't want you [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10899.0s)]
*  to go over your due date. [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10906.0s)]
*  So a lot of times people will naturally go into labor at like 41 weeks. [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10908.0s)]
*  But when you're geriatric, they get nervous because the numbers go slightly up of their [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10912.0s)]
*  being a stillborn. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10918.0s)]
*  That's a weird word, geriatric. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10919.0s)]
*  That's what, after 35. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10921.0s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10923.0s)]
*  35. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10924.0s)]
*  It's not wild though. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10925.0s)]
*  It's not wild because it gets much harder. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10926.0s)]
*  Even, and I feel like there's been a lot of constructive pushback against that kind of [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10929.0s)]
*  narrative that women have been sold that you can just kind of wait until your late 30s [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10935.0s)]
*  to have kids because you can't always. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10941.0s)]
*  You might be able to freeze your eggs and you might be able to take some measures, but [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10945.0s)]
*  it's still much, much harder to get pregnant late 30s, early 40s. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10950.0s)]
*  The problem is like so many people are just trying to figure out their life. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10955.0s)]
*  Like they don't necessarily want to have kids when they're young because they're like, [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10959.0s)]
*  God, I have so many dreams and aspirations and careers. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10962.0s)]
*  Trade-offs. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10965.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10966.0s)]
*  I mean, I got lucky. [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10967.0s)]
*  That's it. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10968.0s)]
*  It was, she truly is like, she might be the last egg that I might go directly into menopause [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10969.0s)]
*  on this podcast. [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10974.0s)]
*  I mean, it was totally a fluke. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10979.0s)]
*  They told me I could not have kids. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10983.0s)]
*  She was, I was 42 years old when I got pregnant with her. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10986.0s)]
*  And I think a large part of the problem too is like people aren't meeting their partners [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10990.0s)]
*  until later as well. [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10995.0s)]
*  Well, also like you don't kind of know who you are until later in life. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=10997.0s)]
*  Like life is so much more complicated now than when people died at 30. [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11001.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11005.0s)]
*  And people didn't necessarily die at 30 because they died of old age at 30. [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11006.0s)]
*  It's like when they talk about people dying really young back in the day, a lot of it's [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11011.0s)]
*  infant mortality that has to be factored in to the percentage of the age. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11016.0s)]
*  But, you know, people today are living longer and a lot of people have careers and you don't [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11019.0s)]
*  want to sacrifice your career. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11026.0s)]
*  But that goes back to my paternity thing. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11028.0s)]
*  There's not much support. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11031.0s)]
*  Right. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11033.0s)]
*  This is another area where I become a single issue voter who is supporting mothers. [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11034.0s)]
*  There isn't support for a woman to go have a baby at 30 and come back to her career in [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11039.0s)]
*  a year. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11044.0s)]
*  We just don't have that kind of support for culturally and in a lot of the workplace. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11045.0s)]
*  It's just not there. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11051.0s)]
*  Well, coming back for in a year, the problem is if you're a person who's running a business [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11053.0s)]
*  and you have someone that works for you and they're a key part of your business and they [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11057.0s)]
*  go, I want to take a year off. [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11061.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11063.0s)]
*  Okay, well, who's going to do that job? [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11064.0s)]
*  I understand. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11065.0s)]
*  And I have to pay you for a year? [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11066.0s)]
*  I understand. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11067.0s)]
*  I have a small business, but I still being, being, I would want to create a business that [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11068.0s)]
*  supported that. [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11075.0s)]
*  I, because it's something I... [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11076.0s)]
*  Ideally. [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11078.0s)]
*  Ideally, yes. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11079.0s)]
*  But that is the kind of, I think, ethos that I would want to create for my business. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11080.0s)]
*  Because I would want to encourage people to have families. [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11086.0s)]
*  That sounds great. [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11090.0s)]
*  That sounds great. [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11091.0s)]
*  Unless you have a business that's like barely getting by. [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11092.0s)]
*  Right. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11096.0s)]
*  And you have an employee and that employee wants to not work for a year because they [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11097.0s)]
*  want to have a baby. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11101.0s)]
*  But are these... [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11102.0s)]
*  And you're like, what are the trade-offs? [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11103.0s)]
*  Is the trade-off that you get to keep your career and my business is fucked because I [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11105.0s)]
*  have to pay you and you don't work? [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11108.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11110.0s)]
*  But are these, I mean, I think more and more of the big corporations are offering... [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11111.0s)]
*  Big corporations. [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11115.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11116.0s)]
*  They are offering this kind of stuff. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11117.0s)]
*  Well, that's great if you're like... [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11118.0s)]
*  We saw the day in the life of a Twitter employee. [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11120.0s)]
*  I don't think it should be mandatory. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11122.0s)]
*  Have you seen the day in the life of a Twitter employee video? [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11123.0s)]
*  No. [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11126.0s)]
*  I posted it. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11127.0s)]
*  Oh, well. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11128.0s)]
*  Go to Twitter. [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11129.0s)]
*  I posted it today. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11130.0s)]
*  It's libs of TikTok. [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11131.0s)]
*  This girl who worked at Twitter posted how great it is to work at Twitter. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11132.0s)]
*  This is a day... [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11136.0s)]
*  It's wild. [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11137.0s)]
*  Because it's not a job. [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11138.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11140.0s)]
*  I mean, you know the Project Veritas video where they caught this guy saying that he [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11141.0s)]
*  works four hours a month? [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11144.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11146.0s)]
*  Four hours a week or whatever it was. [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11148.0s)]
*  I don't understand why they needed so many people. [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11150.0s)]
*  They don't. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11152.0s)]
*  But watch it. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11153.0s)]
*  Play this. [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11154.0s)]
*  Play this. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11155.0s)]
*  Welcome to a day in my life as a Twitter employee. [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11156.0s)]
*  Is this real? [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11158.0s)]
*  So this past week went to SF for the first time at a Twitter office, badged in. [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11159.0s)]
*  Honestly, it took a moment to just soak everything in. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11163.0s)]
*  What a blessing. [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11166.0s)]
*  Also, started my morning off with an iced matcha from the perch. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11168.0s)]
*  Then I had a meeting. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11171.0s)]
*  So quickly scheduled one of these little pod rooms, which were so cool. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11173.0s)]
*  They're literally noise canceling. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11178.0s)]
*  Took my meeting. [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11179.0s)]
*  Got ready for a bunch. [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11180.0s)]
*  Look how delicious this food looks. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11182.0s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11184.0s)]
*  I was so overwhelmed. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11185.0s)]
*  Done. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11187.0s)]
*  Made my way down to this log cabin area. [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11188.0s)]
*  I don't know what this is, but it was really cool. [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11190.0s)]
*  Played some food with all of my friends to kind of unwind a bit. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11193.0s)]
*  Unwind. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11197.0s)]
*  Tough day. [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11198.0s)]
*  Also found this really cool meditation room that I thought was super neat. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11199.0s)]
*  I didn't do any yoga, but they have this yoga room if you are a yogi. [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11202.0s)]
*  So also thought that was really cool. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11207.0s)]
*  Had a couple more meetings in the afternoon. [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11210.0s)]
*  Had a ton of projects that we needed to knock out. [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11213.0s)]
*  Say hi to my teammates. [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11215.0s)]
*  Went to the library to kind of get some more work done. [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11217.0s)]
*  Obviously had to have our afternoon coffee. [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11221.0s)]
*  So made some espresso. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11224.0s)]
*  And then before leaving for the day, had some red wine that's on tap. [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11226.0s)]
*  Went up to the rooftop and just honestly enjoyed the beautiful weather. [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11231.0s)]
*  So awesome trip. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11237.0s)]
*  Wow. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11239.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11240.0s)]
*  She did one meeting. [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11241.0s)]
*  That's a six-figure salary, kids. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11243.0s)]
*  You can be so lucky to have a job that doesn't really exist. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11245.0s)]
*  And you get wine on tap. [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11249.0s)]
*  And you get espressos and green matcha tea. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11250.0s)]
*  And you get to go to the meditation room because you got unwind. [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11253.0s)]
*  Well, they can afford to give people a year off then. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11255.0s)]
*  They can. [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11258.0s)]
*  They clearly don't need them. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11259.0s)]
*  But I don't think it should be mandatory. [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11261.0s)]
*  I just think it should be supported. [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11263.0s)]
*  A year off? [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11267.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11268.0s)]
*  Well, if it's a company like that, it's throwing money away. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11269.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11272.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11273.0s)]
*  I mean, I think a mother should... [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11274.0s)]
*  I was back to work at six weeks, but I owned my own business. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11276.0s)]
*  So trade-offs. [[03:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11279.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing though. [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11281.0s)]
*  Like, do you have the money to take a year off with your own business? [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11282.0s)]
*  No. [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11288.0s)]
*  So would a business have the money to allow you to take a year off [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11290.0s)]
*  if they were an employee and they relied on you? [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11295.0s)]
*  Would my business allow me to take a year off? [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11300.0s)]
*  I feel like I could maybe do it, but I would probably have to fire someone. [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11306.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11311.0s)]
*  And then there's the other thing. [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11312.0s)]
*  It's like... [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11313.0s)]
*  I'm not a big business. [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11314.0s)]
*  I'm not pulling in... [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11315.0s)]
*  So big businesses should have enough money [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11317.0s)]
*  that they could afford to pay people even if they're not working? [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11320.0s)]
*  I mean, isn't it supported by the government in places where it's supported? [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11323.0s)]
*  Like in Germany? [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11328.0s)]
*  Isn't the government supporting the women taking that year off? [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11330.0s)]
*  So you think that's what should happen? [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11334.0s)]
*  I think there should be some support. [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11336.0s)]
*  Sure. [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11338.0s)]
*  But for how long? [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11339.0s)]
*  Maybe a year's not enough. [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11340.0s)]
*  No, just a year. [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11342.0s)]
*  Just a year. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11343.0s)]
*  Do you know that at certain businesses, like there's a business... [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11344.0s)]
*  I don't even want to say the name of the business, [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11348.0s)]
*  but my friend works at this business, [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11350.0s)]
*  and they said that male employees get paternity leave of 18 months. [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11353.0s)]
*  Male employees. [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11360.0s)]
*  What do the females get? [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11362.0s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11363.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11364.0s)]
*  But male employees. [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11365.0s)]
*  Six months. [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11366.0s)]
*  So he was saying that, look, conceivably, I could knock my wife up once a year. [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11367.0s)]
*  Not only that, but during that time, your colleagues, [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11371.0s)]
*  if they get raises and advances, you're not supposed to be denied those raises and advances. [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11376.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11382.0s)]
*  So you're not working for 18 months. [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11383.0s)]
*  You continue to get raises. [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11385.0s)]
*  And if you knock up your wife again, like a year later, you could have Irish twins, right? [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11387.0s)]
*  A year later, knock up your wife again. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11391.0s)]
*  You keep getting money, keep getting raises. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11393.0s)]
*  All you have to do is keep having babies. [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11396.0s)]
*  How do you support the family, though? [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11399.0s)]
*  I mean, how do you support not like your family, like the idea of having a family? [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11401.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11408.0s)]
*  There's, you know, I think like part of the collapsing birth rates in particular in this country is that [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11409.0s)]
*  there's not much support for people to have families. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11416.0s)]
*  Right. [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11420.0s)]
*  So how do we encourage people to have families and support them like child care? [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11421.0s)]
*  But I'm talking about the most ridiculous aspect. [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11427.0s)]
*  Well, that's ridiculous. [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11430.0s)]
*  I mean, I think my cousin and I mentioned this last time in Germany, [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11431.0s)]
*  they get a year off and then he got nine months off, I think, the mail gets. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11435.0s)]
*  Canada has a choice between 12 or 18 months. [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11440.0s)]
*  Wow. For everybody? [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11444.0s)]
*  I think so. [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11446.0s)]
*  So is it socialized? [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11447.0s)]
*  It's not. They have socialized health care. [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11449.0s)]
*  Is that government funded? [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11452.0s)]
*  What jobs? Like for all jobs? [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11454.0s)]
*  So like say if you work for a podcast studio in Canada. [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11456.0s)]
*  In Austin. [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11462.0s)]
*  In Canada, because this is not Canada. [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11463.0s)]
*  And your, I mean, is this for the male as well? [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11466.0s)]
*  My friend was talking about how ridiculous it is. [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11471.0s)]
*  This one actually says maternity leave. [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11473.0s)]
*  They're saying I get 18 months off. [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11475.0s)]
*  Well, that's a lot. [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11476.0s)]
*  18 months for the man. Not for the woman, for the man. [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11477.0s)]
*  I need help. I need help. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11480.0s)]
*  I mean. [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11483.0s)]
*  Well, you get help. The guy's not working. [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11484.0s)]
*  18 months and he gets raises. [[03:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11486.0s)]
*  I would actually love that. [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11488.0s)]
*  What if everybody does it? [[03:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11490.0s)]
*  What if the whole company is like, hey, Bob just got his wife pregnant. [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11491.0s)]
*  That's all you have to do? [[03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11494.0s)]
*  Parental benefits are paid for a maximum of 35 shared weeks plus five weeks of daddy days paid within a year of the birth or adoption of a child. [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11496.0s)]
*  In 2022, the weekly benefit rate is 55% of the parents average weekly insurable earnings up to a maximum of $638 a week before taxes. [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11506.0s)]
*  That's not a lot. [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11516.0s)]
*  Who pays for that? [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11517.0s)]
*  The other one was Finland, I think. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11519.0s)]
*  You get 80% of your pay for 480 days. [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11522.0s)]
*  But is that mandated for private businesses or is that government employees? [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11525.0s)]
*  I'm having a hard time getting that actual thing down. [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11529.0s)]
*  Or is it the government just pays for everybody? [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11531.0s)]
*  Look, ideally, it would be great if a woman could have a child and still have a career and give her enough time to recover and come back. [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11534.0s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11541.0s)]
*  But like, at what time? [[03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11543.0s)]
*  You wouldn't want to come back. [[03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11545.0s)]
*  My first two years you have a toddler. [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11546.0s)]
*  You want to be home with the kid. [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11548.0s)]
*  My first two two months of like after having the baby, I was like, feminism was a mistake. [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11550.0s)]
*  How long is paternity leave in the US? [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11558.0s)]
*  In the majority of states across the country, expectant new fathers are entitled to a period of 12 weeks. [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11560.0s)]
*  That's not... [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11566.0s)]
*  Unpaid job secured paternity leave. [[03:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11567.0s)]
*  That's unpaid. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11570.0s)]
*  My husband didn't get it. He had to take time off. [[03:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11571.0s)]
*  So that's states. So that's state law. [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11574.0s)]
*  Expectant parents are entitled. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11577.0s)]
*  But while time off is an expected right in the US, unpaid leave is simply too expensive for most families to afford. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11580.0s)]
*  However, California, New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, motherfucking pop ups, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Washington, Connecticut and the District of Columbia have active paid parental leave policies. [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11587.0s)]
*  Other states like Colorado and Oregon have this policy in view. [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11600.0s)]
*  All those yet to come into effect. [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11604.0s)]
*  Yeah. And like you have to have a certain number of employees. [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11606.0s)]
*  So my husband wasn't eligible because the business wasn't eligible because they didn't have as you have to have, I think, like 50 employees or something like that. [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11610.0s)]
*  So they figure once you have 50 employees, there's enough money rolling around. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11619.0s)]
*  You need to give people time off. [[03:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11622.0s)]
*  I mean, a month would have been nice. [[03:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11624.0s)]
*  It's nice. Yeah. [[03:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11626.0s)]
*  I didn't need much, but it's definitely I needed help with. [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11627.0s)]
*  You need a lot of help when you have that new baby. [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11634.0s)]
*  Federal employees receive 12 weeks of paid time off following childbirth or the placement of a child for adoption or foster care. [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11637.0s)]
*  These employees must have worked 12 months in part time or full time role in federal services. [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11645.0s)]
*  Federal employees. [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11651.0s)]
*  That's not even that's not that much. [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11652.0s)]
*  It's not that much. [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11654.0s)]
*  No, I was compared to other countries. [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11655.0s)]
*  No, I was just you're just kind of that fourth trimester is really something I wish I had known more about before. [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11657.0s)]
*  It was one of those things that they say like the fourth trimester is that three first three months when you're postpartum. [[03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11665.0s)]
*  And it's gnarly. [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11671.0s)]
*  You're like recovering and trying to manage the baby and the baby's not sleeping and you're not sleeping because the baby's not sleeping. [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11672.0s)]
*  No, she and colic. [[03:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11678.0s)]
*  I mean, God bless anyone out there who had a child with colic. [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11680.0s)]
*  You only know if you know. [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11683.0s)]
*  But that that was that was so explain to people. [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11685.0s)]
*  So it's inconsolable. [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11689.0s)]
*  There's actually like a rule of threes. [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11691.0s)]
*  I'm writing a whole piece about it because it was so mind blowing. [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11693.0s)]
*  But that they it's inconsolable crying for no apparent reason. [[03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11696.0s)]
*  The baby is OK. [[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11700.0s)]
*  They're healthy. [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11701.0s)]
*  It's just in a lot of people say it's witching hour. [[03:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11702.0s)]
*  But it's colic is specific in that it's they say it's the rule of threes more than three hours of crying a day three at least three days a week for at least three weeks. [[03:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11705.0s)]
*  And if your baby's doing that, then they probably have colic. [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11717.0s)]
*  And my child started crying around four weeks. [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11721.0s)]
*  And that's generally around when it will start or appear. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11726.0s)]
*  And just it was like six weeks of it. [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11729.0s)]
*  And it's hours of crying hours, hours. [[03:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11732.0s)]
*  And you comfort them. [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11736.0s)]
*  And there's no consolation. [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11737.0s)]
*  It's so heartbreaking as a new parent. [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11739.0s)]
*  It's like I I don't know how. [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11741.0s)]
*  First of all, any single parent out there, male, female, who's doing this, I don't know how you do it. [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11744.0s)]
*  You deserve awards and accolades. [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11750.0s)]
*  And I don't I don't know how anyone single does this because I could not have done it. [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11752.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe I could have. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11758.0s)]
*  But it was it was my husband and I had to tag out. [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11759.0s)]
*  They the piece I'm writing, I was when I went down the rabbit hole of colic, I was like, oh, my God, they use inconsolable crying babies to in Guantanamo to train the operatives to like resist torches. [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11763.0s)]
*  Torture, essentially. [[03:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11779.0s)]
*  And that's one of the things they were using. [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11780.0s)]
*  How do they do that? [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11783.0s)]
*  They would play crying babies. [[03:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11784.0s)]
*  They play recordings of crying babies, crying inconsolably for hours. [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11786.0s)]
*  And that's not the same as an actual baby, especially a baby that's yours. [[03:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11790.0s)]
*  I know. [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11793.0s)]
*  But it's still drives people insane. [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11794.0s)]
*  OK, it's still like it's still something that drives people crazy. [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11797.0s)]
*  Oh, so you're saying they do that instead of torture? [[03:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11800.0s)]
*  They they're yeah, they they do it. [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11803.0s)]
*  It's one of the things that they use as torture to train these people to resist it. [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11806.0s)]
*  I see. [[03:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11811.0s)]
*  Because I'm like, this is crazy. [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11812.0s)]
*  It was so we would have to like, you know, take shifts. [[03:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11814.0s)]
*  And every night you get anxious and it's it's hard as a new parent because you don't you feel like a failure. [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11819.0s)]
*  You're just like I. [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11826.0s)]
*  But I also think it's kind of a good hazing into parent parenthood where you're like, there are some things that are just out of my control. [[03:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11827.0s)]
*  Right. [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11834.0s)]
*  But it's a whole thing. [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11835.0s)]
*  There's I didn't know what it was. [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11837.0s)]
*  And I like heard about it. [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11839.0s)]
*  And then people in my life who had had it were like, I put it I said something on Twitter and someone was like, I was like, anyone have any suggestions? [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11841.0s)]
*  And someone was like, I read this to my husband and he shuddered like people who dealt with it have PTSD from it because it's so disturbing just day after day. [[03:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11849.0s)]
*  It's it's hard. [[03:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11860.0s)]
*  It was that was that was hard. [[03:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11861.0s)]
*  That was hard. [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11863.0s)]
*  That was like that was definitely a fourth trimester. [[03:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11864.0s)]
*  And thank God. [[03:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11867.0s)]
*  And my husband was around at night. [[03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11868.0s)]
*  So thank God. [[03:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11871.0s)]
*  The shift of who you are as a person after you have a child is a very dramatic physical, psychological, emotional. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11872.0s)]
*  It's it's in your DNA shift. [[03:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11882.0s)]
*  You know, and that's why people freak out about people who don't have children trying to come up with ideas for what should happen to children. [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11885.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11892.0s)]
*  You know? [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11893.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[03:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11894.0s)]
*  I mean, Mama Bear definitely is a real thing, despite what they might say. [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11895.0s)]
*  It's real. [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11899.0s)]
*  It's I I understand. [[03:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11900.0s)]
*  That's why I was saying the beginning. [[03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11903.0s)]
*  I just have eaten so much humble pie. [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11905.0s)]
*  There's so many people in my life. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11906.0s)]
*  I was so it's so cliche. [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11908.0s)]
*  Like I was so self-centered. [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11912.0s)]
*  And when I was pregnant, I'm like, why didn't I listen? [[03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11914.0s)]
*  And sure, it wasn't applicable to me. [[03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11916.0s)]
*  But why didn't I pay attention when my sisters and sister in laws and all of my relatives and cousins were talking about what they went through when they had their child, you know, whether they had a C-section or a vaginal birth? [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11918.0s)]
*  I just I know they told me these stories and I was just not paying attention at all. [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11931.0s)]
*  And now and then I was like, tell me all your stories. [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11936.0s)]
*  I need everything. [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11939.0s)]
*  And on Instagram at night with pre-exiety, just trying to calm myself down and feeling really like just a piece of shit. [[03:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11940.0s)]
*  Just a piece of shit. [[03:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11954.0s)]
*  Because in so many ways, I really was just like that cliched Jen. [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11956.0s)]
*  It's Exxer who kind of was apathetic about all of it and was like, I whatever you don't know until you know. [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11961.0s)]
*  And I know that I can take a nap. [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11967.0s)]
*  And it's like there's nothing like it. [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11969.0s)]
*  Nothing like it. [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11973.0s)]
*  There's nothing like it. [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11974.0s)]
*  Well, I look forward to your new perspectives. [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11975.0s)]
*  I'm looking forward to your writing. [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11978.0s)]
*  And it's just a new way you approach things in your podcast, because whenever someone encounters just a radical change in the way they see the world, it's always fascinating for people whose opinions I value. [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11980.0s)]
*  And for people that have unique perspectives. [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11994.0s)]
*  I wrote this piece. [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11997.0s)]
*  I regret being a slut recently and it went huge and it's tapped into something. [[03:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=11998.0s)]
*  And people were like, oh, this is because you had a baby. [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12004.0s)]
*  And I'm like, no, I was regretting it before I had kids. [[03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12007.0s)]
*  But I wanted to say it was something. [[03:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12010.0s)]
*  There was one of your bits that you used to do all the time. [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12014.0s)]
*  And I'm not sure if you know, I don't do that bit anymore. [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12017.0s)]
*  It was about being a slut. [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12019.0s)]
*  And every time you did it, I would be like, I had to leave once and go to the bathroom when you're doing it, because I felt so I was like, what is coming up for me? [[03:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12020.0s)]
*  I had to talk to my therapist about it. [[03:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12029.0s)]
*  I'm like, there's this bit and every time he does it, I'm like, and we talked through it. [[03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12031.0s)]
*  And it was it was that that was coming up was like this regret about being a slut that I didn't feel like culturally I should have. [[03:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12036.0s)]
*  There's so much like slut walk and like be a proud slut and just that is the culture that I came up in. [[03:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12045.0s)]
*  Free the nipple we talked about a lot of the choices I made where I felt so much shame and regret about. [[03:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12052.0s)]
*  And I just want to say thank you for that bit, because that was kind of the beginning of being able to crack because I'm not like one of those people who sees something in common. [[03:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12062.0s)]
*  I'm not like somebody that I don't like and I'm like, you're an asshole. [[03:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12075.0s)]
*  If something comes up for me, I'm like, oh, that's interesting. [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12078.0s)]
*  What's that reaction all about? [[03:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12081.0s)]
*  And I ended up writing this piece because Louise Perry wrote a book, The Case Against Sexual Revolution, and it kind of framed what I had been feeling. [[03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12083.0s)]
*  And it's brilliant. [[03:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12094.0s)]
*  I think she's so brave for even writing it because there is I feel like there is a lot of us like geriatrics or maybe late earlier millennial later millennials, some Gen Xers who came up through the sexual revolution and were sold this idea of like you can have sex like a guy. [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12095.0s)]
*  You can and there's no consequence. [[03:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12113.0s)]
*  And we're coming back. [[03:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12116.0s)]
*  We're like, it's a trap. [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12117.0s)]
*  Go back. [[03:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12119.0s)]
*  Well, you know, the weird thing that happened was the birth control pill. [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12120.0s)]
*  Yeah, technology with with many. [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12124.0s)]
*  There's many things that were weird about it. [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12127.0s)]
*  And one of the weird ones is it convinced your body that you were pregnant, which is really wild. [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12129.0s)]
*  We I mean, the fact that we're talking about introducing hormones into a person's body, introducing hormones on a regular basis to a giant swath of the female population, it shifts the way you view people, the way you see things. [[03:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12135.0s)]
*  Everything you view the world in a different way. [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12153.0s)]
*  And they've done studies that shows that it changes how a woman is attracted to different men. [[03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12156.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12162.0s)]
*  You never heard that. [[03:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12163.0s)]
*  I hated the pill. [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12164.0s)]
*  I hated it. [[03:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12165.0s)]
*  It made me insane. [[03:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12166.0s)]
*  It's it's one of a guy that I know his daughter died from blood clots. [[03:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12167.0s)]
*  She was on the pill. [[03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12173.0s)]
*  Was she smoking? [[03:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12175.0s)]
*  Yes. [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12176.0s)]
*  Oh, they warn you about that. [[03:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12177.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12178.0s)]
*  Smoking and the pill. [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12179.0s)]
*  There's something about the combination of the two. [[03:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12181.0s)]
*  Wow. [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12183.0s)]
*  That's horrific. [[03:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12184.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12185.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12186.0s)]
*  No, I hated it. [[03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12187.0s)]
*  Every time I went on it, I was lunatic. [[03:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12188.0s)]
*  I hated it. [[03:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12189.0s)]
*  I hated the way it made me feel. [[03:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12190.0s)]
*  I never really liked it, but it is the it unyoked sex from consequence for the first time. [[03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12192.0s)]
*  And in human history. [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12198.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12200.0s)]
*  And I don't. [[03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12201.0s)]
*  And like I said in this piece, I don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water. [[03:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12202.0s)]
*  I think I like being able to have a job and buy a house. [[03:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12205.0s)]
*  Feminism is good. [[03:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12208.0s)]
*  But this aspect of the sexual revolution in particular, I feel like has left a lot of [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12209.0s)]
*  women feeling empty and like something is missing and that they've been sold a bit of [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12215.0s)]
*  a lie, you know, years down the road when. [[03:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12222.0s)]
*  Do you think it's like a thing like why do men get to live life like this? [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12225.0s)]
*  Well, they are free of consequences. [[03:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12230.0s)]
*  Why can't I live like this? [[03:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12232.0s)]
*  And then people just sort of reinforce that. [[03:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12234.0s)]
*  I mean, Louise Perry was funny on the when she came on my podcast. [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12236.0s)]
*  She said, if you want to get mad at someone for being a misogynist, get mad at Mother [[03:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12239.0s)]
*  Nature. [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12243.0s)]
*  Wow. [[03:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12244.0s)]
*  Yeah, she's brilliant. [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12245.0s)]
*  And and I think I think her book gave people like me who felt that way, like I was saying [[03:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12248.0s)]
*  hers is a pretty academic. [[03:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12254.0s)]
*  And I was saying in my piece, like I it's the conversation is a little bit like those [[03:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12256.0s)]
*  sluts over there, not and that book affected me like the in the the whatever, like the [[03:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12262.0s)]
*  part where you say who the book is for the again, Mambring. [[03:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12270.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12275.0s)]
*  She said for the women who learn the hard way and I read it and I just burst into tears. [[03:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12276.0s)]
*  It just made I mean pregnancy hormones, too. [[03:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12281.0s)]
*  But that to me, I learned the hard way. [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12284.0s)]
*  You know, there's and the emails I've got from people from that piece. [[03:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12287.0s)]
*  Women and men, gay men. [[03:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12291.0s)]
*  It's been really crazy, like really overwhelming, actually. [[03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12294.0s)]
*  And and remarkable just how much of an actual body count there is in this wake. [[03:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12299.0s)]
*  How much you love writing. [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12306.0s)]
*  I do. [[03:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12309.0s)]
*  And that's probably one of the reasons why you love writing, that you could write a piece [[03:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12310.0s)]
*  and it can have the sort of profound effect where people do. [[03:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12315.0s)]
*  They they read and it resonates with how they feel about stuff. [[03:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12319.0s)]
*  I love it for two reasons. [[03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12324.0s)]
*  That being one, because I everything I I've really been thinking a lot about the why of [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12326.0s)]
*  why I do things. [[03:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12331.0s)]
*  I love podcasting because I love connecting to people. [[03:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12332.0s)]
*  I love comedy because I love hearing people laugh. [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12335.0s)]
*  It's like making making my daughter laugh is the best thing in the entire world. [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12339.0s)]
*  And laughter is just so contagious and healing. [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12344.0s)]
*  And I love writing because a lot of the time I don't there's some wisdom in my fingers [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12347.0s)]
*  and I don't I don't always know where I'm going with the piece. [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12353.0s)]
*  It took me years to write that piece. [[03:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12356.0s)]
*  I regret being a slide. [[03:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12358.0s)]
*  I was going to write it back in 2018 and I couldn't really frame it the right way. [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12359.0s)]
*  That that book helped me frame it. [[03:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12364.0s)]
*  And I also had enough time to sit and think and have podcasts, conversations about it, [[03:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12366.0s)]
*  where I think a lot of the thinking that we do in this is in real time. [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12373.0s)]
*  You know, you're just like working stuff out. [[03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12378.0s)]
*  Right. [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12380.0s)]
*  And people need space to do that. [[03:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12381.0s)]
*  Yeah, they need to be able to work out their ideas, have their ideas challenged. [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12383.0s)]
*  And writing is where I get to sit down and really try and be thoughtful about a lot of the [[03:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12387.0s)]
*  information that I might have been taken in. [[03:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12395.0s)]
*  And yeah, there is still something that is resonant about it. [[03:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12397.0s)]
*  And I like the idea that it's kind of like time traveling. [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12401.0s)]
*  Like somebody could read that and I'd be dead and they'd be brought back to another. [[03:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12403.0s)]
*  That's how reading always feels to me. [[03:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12408.0s)]
*  You can go into the science fiction or the future or the past. [[03:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12410.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12414.0s)]
*  So yeah, I think of all the things I do, that one comes the most naturally. [[03:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12415.0s)]
*  But that's why I'm excited to have started like Substack where I feel like I can lean into that more. [[03:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12421.0s)]
*  It forces me to produce. [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12427.0s)]
*  No, that's awesome. [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtf2QIGH_uo&t=12430.0s)]
